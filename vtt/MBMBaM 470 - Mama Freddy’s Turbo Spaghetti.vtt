00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.480 --> 00:47.280
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the

00:47.280 --> 00:53.840
Maginera. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I be your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:53.840 --> 01:01.360
Yo, g'day. Hail and well met. I'm your youngest, Harold.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.080
Don't love this.

01:02.880 --> 01:03.280
Griffin.

01:05.200 --> 01:05.920
I don't love it.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.120
We're high in the fantasy spirit, because we've just returned from

01:11.120 --> 01:15.760
the biggest nerd event of the year, good, gentle folk.

01:16.560 --> 01:22.160
Folks, the rumors are true. The meek have inherited the earth.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.200
Oh wow.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.600
These nerds, they're running the show.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.120
Oh, I see.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.880
I looked for a solid week for someone to talk to me about sports.

01:32.880 --> 01:37.360
Yeah, you remember that poster that was hanging up on high school walls?

01:37.360 --> 01:42.480
It's like, if you get made fun of now, don't worry, you'll be Steve Jobs.

01:42.480 --> 01:47.200
Oh, I saw hundreds of thousands of Jobses here.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.880
Everyone was a Steve Jobs.

01:48.880 --> 01:54.400
Yeah, Jobses, Jobses everywhere, but not a basketball to drink.

01:54.400 --> 01:59.200
Did you guys make any new, you know, big celeb friends?

01:59.200 --> 02:02.720
That's why you go to Comic Con for the connectiones.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.360
You know what I mean?

02:03.920 --> 02:06.320
Yeah, you brush your elbows with arrow.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.400
You brush your shoulders with flash.

02:11.280 --> 02:17.440
I met Spider-Man, got a photo with Spider-Man.

02:17.440 --> 02:21.200
Spider-Man came to our signing, and he said,

02:22.080 --> 02:24.160
thank you, it's such an honor to meet you.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.640
And I'm like, are you kidding with me right now?

02:26.640 --> 02:27.680
After all you've done?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.840
You're the web slinger.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.360
After all your good work.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.360
I left, here's how, what's cooler than being at a cool party?

02:35.360 --> 02:36.080
Ice cold.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.280
Leaving a cool party.

02:39.280 --> 02:46.240
I left Comic Con's most exclusive event to go home and eat a muffin top.

02:46.240 --> 02:51.520
A chocolate muffin top and a drink of vitamin water

02:51.520 --> 02:54.240
in my hotel room while I play Dragon Quest Builders.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.640
That's kind of the most exclusive.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.520
The most exclusive party is the one you leave.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.440
It was, I've never seen anything like it before my entire life.

03:03.440 --> 03:07.600
There were famos littered, strewn about.

03:09.040 --> 03:14.000
I stepped over the corpse of Stephen Amell.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.720
He was just there, there's like 30 arrows there.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.640
I was playfully pushed into the pool by Taye Diggs,

03:23.440 --> 03:27.200
but then I bounced off of Cuba Gooding Jr.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.200
who was in the pool to land on the other side

03:29.200 --> 03:30.960
without getting wet, so many famoses.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.680
And you're over there and you got caught by John Cryer.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.920
And John Cryer said you safely made it to the other side.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.400
Actually, that's not a joke, he was there.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.480
Yes, and you can tell that when John Cryer said

03:40.480 --> 03:41.920
the thing about making it to the other side,

03:41.920 --> 03:44.640
he meant both literally the pool and figuratively

03:44.640 --> 03:45.600
to the other side of fame.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.560
To the other side of fame, and now we're all famoses.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.280
You know what people won't tell you about red carpets?

03:51.280 --> 03:52.720
And this is probably not for everyone.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.280
I've only been to one red carpet event in my entire life.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.840
Well, the Margaritaville was a blue carpet,

03:57.840 --> 03:58.240
but this was a red carpet event.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.240
We've only been on one side, yes.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.640
You only are there, you could just walk in.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.680
So there was a door that you walk,

04:07.680 --> 04:09.280
this is Entertainment Weekly thing.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.960
And it was an honor, wow, what an honor.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.120
Wow, what an honor, H-O-N-O-R.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.560
So anyway, we went.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.640
And you go in, and they're like,

04:16.640 --> 04:19.120
well, there's the entrance, and then over there

04:19.760 --> 04:21.680
is where the red carpet is.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.200
To go on it, you have to wait in like a line.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.600
And this line is like, there's some people

04:27.600 --> 04:29.760
from the new Spider-Man movie in this line.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.600
John Cryer is in this line.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.520
We were ahead of the Spider-Manzes.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.200
The Spider-Manzes was behind us.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.360
Not a Spider-Man, but like some cast member from Spider-Man.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.840
Legit, I mean, top tier talent

04:43.840 --> 04:46.480
that I honestly, earnestly suggested

04:46.480 --> 04:48.080
we should let them go in front of us.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.000
There's no way that we should be.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.680
But you could just go into the party,

04:51.680 --> 04:53.200
which is what a lot of people were doing.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.000
There were five minutes less of canapes

04:56.000 --> 04:58.160
for the cast of Spider-Man because they had to wait

04:58.160 --> 05:00.560
for us to finish getting our picture taken.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.240
Strange but true.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.400
I did enjoy making good, good friends with David Harbour.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.640
Now we didn't, we didn't talk.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.100
Yeah.

05:12.720 --> 05:18.000
And we were only in the same place for like half a second

05:18.000 --> 05:20.960
as he got into a car as we got out of a car.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.560
But I felt him like register

05:25.280 --> 05:27.520
like my celebrity Musk on the air.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.360
And like I registered his, and I think he was like,

05:32.160 --> 05:35.520
there's another like big bearded man here.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.640
Sure, yeah.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.960
I saw it Travis, he was getting in the car

05:38.960 --> 05:42.400
and you guys like met eyes and just walked by each other

05:42.400 --> 05:44.400
and he tickled you real fast.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.440
He tickled you real quick.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.120
Real quick, he and I took a second

05:47.120 --> 05:49.600
to bully Tom Hiddleston for being a nerd.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.240
It was so fast, it was so fast.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.560
Yes, but like that was the only connection we made

05:54.560 --> 05:56.880
just real quick, me and David Harbour

05:56.880 --> 05:59.760
bullied Tom Hiddleston and then David Harbour had to go.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.640
But he did, he kissed me on both cheeks

06:02.640 --> 06:05.040
and said, now the power is yours.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
We were standing outside this party

06:07.040 --> 06:08.480
waiting for the person that was supposed

06:08.480 --> 06:09.520
to get us into the party.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.800
And we were waiting there feeling like we didn't belong.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.880
And as we're standing there feeling incredibly uncomfortable

06:16.880 --> 06:20.880
and really not of a place where we should be there at all.

06:22.320 --> 06:27.920
Tom Hiddleston, TV's Loki walks out of this place.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.680
TVS's Loki.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.920
TVS's Loki walks out and walked past us

06:33.920 --> 06:35.360
and to get into his car.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.760
And I asked Griffin, I said, I hope he didn't eat

06:39.760 --> 06:42.080
all the free hot dogs that he had

06:42.080 --> 06:44.560
because he had that sort of self-satisfied grin

06:44.560 --> 06:46.160
on his face that he always had,

06:46.160 --> 06:48.560
which I'm assuming is because he ate all the free hot dogs.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.320
And he kept patting his tummy and saying,

06:50.320 --> 06:51.760
yum, yum, hot dog tummy.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.360
Yum, yum, winter king.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.200
And then I did a fun accent where I was like,

06:55.200 --> 06:59.040
they got split up buns, they got brioche.

06:59.040 --> 07:04.800
They got a new topping only famos know about.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.240
They got hot dogs too.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.240
The sequel to dogs.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.400
Yeah, that was fun.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.320
Fun time.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.280
It wasn't fun.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.760
Maybe for Travis it was fun.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.320
Maybe you had fun.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.200
It was way fun for me.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.000
Good, I'm glad you all received energy from it

07:20.000 --> 07:23.200
instead of having it depleted from you like a vampire.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.680
I expected to be arrested.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.960
That's where I was at as I was walking around this party.

07:28.960 --> 07:33.440
I fully expected a helicopter to swoop in and arrest me.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.200
They wouldn't even send an officer.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.280
They would just kind of scoop me up with a big claw.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.200
They would lower one of those things that they use

07:41.200 --> 07:43.360
to rescue people who have been injured in the desert.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.760
Yes, except it's got a trapping claw on it.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.280
It would swoop down and grab me.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.200
And as I flew away, Darcy Cardin would wave

07:49.200 --> 07:50.960
to the helicopter and be like, thank you.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.680
Thank you, you ate all the hot dogs.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.040
He ate all the hot dogs.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.160
We saw so many, guys, this was a wild one.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.680
This was a wild week.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.520
I hope this doesn't come off as bragging.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.400
No, we did not belong.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.400
We did not belong there.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.880
We were like the kids in the mix of files

08:08.880 --> 08:10.400
of Mrs. Batesley, Frank Weiler.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.560
We were hiding in the museum just hoping the security guards

08:14.560 --> 08:17.440
did not catch us as we ate from the vending machines

08:17.440 --> 08:18.480
to stay alive.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.040
Dad added a fun layer of difficulty to it.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.240
Oh, yeah, yeah, we played hard mode.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.760
Dad, we did play hard mode, new game plots,

08:29.760 --> 08:35.360
because Dad has a tic, which makes him, legally,

08:35.360 --> 08:39.040
whenever he sees a famous person,

08:39.040 --> 08:42.160
he has to loudly announce their name

08:42.160 --> 08:43.920
or a role that they're well known for.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.920
And there's fucking Ducky!

08:45.920 --> 08:50.240
Yeah, right, yeah, Dad's four feet away from you.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.040
Now, to our credit, and I think that this is a testament today,

08:55.040 --> 08:56.400
did not say there's Ducky.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.720
He said, I wonder if he's still bald

08:58.720 --> 09:00.480
because he played Lex Luthor.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.400
Yeah, that's what he said about John Crier.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
And then John Crier turned around and said,

09:04.400 --> 09:07.280
yeah, that's great, Clint.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.000
And then once we got inside the very crowded party,

09:10.000 --> 09:10.960
Dad would just go somewhere.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.960
That would just tell what they're off.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.320
And we would have to find Dad,

09:14.320 --> 09:17.600
because he can't, y'all, he can't party anymore.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.400
He can't party like Ducky do.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.320
I will say this.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.840
So Dad introduced himself to Brandon Routh,

09:27.120 --> 09:28.240
one of the Superman's.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.200
And then later in the evening,

09:31.920 --> 09:34.960
our friend Sarah Benincasa introduced me to Brandon Routh,

09:34.960 --> 09:37.200
and Brandon Routh said, oh, that was your dad.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.080
And like, remembered our father.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.040
He gets Sarah for you, and there's two places

09:43.040 --> 09:46.160
where Travis is known as Max Kidd.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.120
It's Huntington and Brandon Routh's house.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.520
Oh, yeah, you know my friend, your dad.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.800
Apparently, Dad told me later that Brandon Routh said to him,

09:56.800 --> 09:58.160
like, are you an actor?

09:58.160 --> 10:00.160
And Dad explained all of his stage work

10:00.160 --> 10:01.440
in Huntington, West Virginia.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.640
Fuck, yeah.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.320
Yes, see, that rules.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.760
I wish I had the spiritual confidence of my father.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.960
But I mean, like, the whole thing was weird.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.360
I guess it's all thank you to everybody

10:15.360 --> 10:16.880
who came out to, like, all our signings

10:16.880 --> 10:19.840
and bought our new book, The Avenger Zone,

10:19.840 --> 10:20.960
or on the Rockport Limited,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.360
and came to all our events and shows.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.280
Like, that's the, you're the, you are our only,

10:27.280 --> 10:31.200
you're like our cool friend that gets us into parties.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.360
Like, I don't know, a bunch of other people know

10:33.360 --> 10:35.440
who these guys are, because we certainly don't.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.600
So we appreciate it.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.560
Thank you for making all our lives so strange.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.720
It feels increasingly like a dare,

10:42.720 --> 10:46.880
but holy fuck.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.240
They haven't chickened out yet.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.040
Let's see, I don't know.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
Maybe we'll invite them to, I don't know,

10:51.040 --> 10:53.360
another party with, like, two John Criers

10:53.360 --> 10:55.040
and see if they get the hint this time.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.240
Just want to say this world is bullshit, you know?

10:59.280 --> 11:01.120
This is the world of fame?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.640
Fiona Apple, I just wanted to get out there

11:02.640 --> 11:04.480
and say, like, it was a fine party.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.320
The hot dogs were just scrumptious,

11:06.320 --> 11:08.320
but this whole world is bullshit,

11:08.320 --> 11:10.480
and don't let anybody tell you who to be,

11:10.480 --> 11:12.160
like Fiona Apple said once.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.080
Wow, that's beautiful.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.000
But Griffin, what if I want to be,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.600
like, a hobnobbing celebrity?

11:18.480 --> 11:21.040
That doesn't, that's, then you're bullshit.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.400
Oh no, ow!

11:22.400 --> 11:23.680
When John Crier came over, he was like,

11:23.680 --> 11:25.040
hey, I met some of your families.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.400
I hear you do a podcast.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.280
That sounds really interesting.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.800
You know, I used to play, and I'm like,

11:28.800 --> 11:30.000
bullshit, dude!

11:30.640 --> 11:31.360
Bullshit!

11:34.080 --> 11:36.160
Hey, somebody come get Ducky.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.600
Brandon Routh is like, hey, me and your brother

11:37.600 --> 11:39.120
are literally going out for hamburgers.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.600
Bullshit, bud!

11:41.600 --> 11:43.920
I've seen through your lies, Superman!

11:44.560 --> 11:46.240
And when Melissa Fumero was like,

11:46.240 --> 11:47.280
oh, it's so nice to meet you,

11:47.280 --> 11:49.600
I was like, yeah, it's nice to meet you as well.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.800
I'm a huge fan, and you're super nice.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.960
See, he's bullshit, Justin.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.600
Not like us.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.160
He's falling in.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.920
Sheep and wolf's clothing.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.680
I, when I met, when I met Ashton,

11:59.680 --> 12:01.840
I said, who are you in Lion King?

12:01.840 --> 12:03.280
And he said, I wasn't in Lion King.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.960
I said, then what fucking good are ya?

12:05.520 --> 12:06.400
I wandered away.

12:06.400 --> 12:06.720
No, that was good.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.080
And he knew who had the power

12:08.080 --> 12:09.200
in that relationship, for sure.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.480
That was a good one.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.920
That was good.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.760
I asked everybody what they thought of Lion King

12:13.760 --> 12:14.800
or if they were in it.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.240
That's the only people I wanted to talk to

12:16.240 --> 12:18.240
is people who had seen Lion King

12:18.240 --> 12:20.560
or performed in the film Lion King.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.320
The guy did Moana, the musical guy.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.640
He came over and I was like, were you in Lion King?

12:26.640 --> 12:28.480
And he's like, Justin, we've been friends for years.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.080
It's like, I don't have any friends

12:30.080 --> 12:31.600
that didn't work on Lion King.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.480
Yeah, that was true.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.760
He started crying.

12:33.760 --> 12:34.560
He started crying.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.200
Yeah, he was hurt.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.960
Because actually, I was like,

12:36.960 --> 12:38.640
Lion King's the only part of this whole,

12:38.640 --> 12:40.320
and I pointed to everybody at the party,

12:40.320 --> 12:42.000
world that isn't bullshit.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.680
It's the only legit one.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.320
And then Seth Rogen was like, I was in Lion King.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.080
And that's when dad started screaming,

12:48.080 --> 12:49.440
are you Nathan Lane?

12:49.440 --> 12:50.480
Are you Nathan Lane?

12:50.480 --> 12:52.560
Like in his face over and over again.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.720
And they pushed him over the balcony.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.040
I do want to say one other thing about this

12:57.040 --> 12:59.040
before we move on for this intolerable section

12:59.040 --> 13:00.160
of the podcast.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.440
At a separate after party event

13:03.440 --> 13:04.800
that was not really a party,

13:04.800 --> 13:08.160
but was just a bunch of us sitting around at a bar,

13:08.160 --> 13:13.120
Griffin did, during a particularly heated round of Uno,

13:13.120 --> 13:17.520
hadouken an entire beer onto Lin-Manuel Miranda's pants.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.920
Which I mention only because

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
it's the exact thing you're worried about

13:21.920 --> 13:23.760
happening at these other parts.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.720
Like, you're not gonna do something worse than that.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.840
Like, the worst thing had already happened to you,

13:29.840 --> 13:34.240
which you spin kicked an entire beer

13:34.240 --> 13:35.040
onto this poor gentleman.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.400
I didn't, it wasn't a hadouken.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.240
It wasn't a hadouken.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.840
It was a closed fist punch into a beer glass

13:41.840 --> 13:43.920
because I got excited about a card I had to play.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.280
And there it is, there's the truth.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.960
And like, we squashed that beef right away.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.760
We traded pants.

13:48.880 --> 13:49.280
Okay.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.400
Okay, moving on.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.000
This is an advice show.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.640
It's not just a San Diego Comic-Con recap.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.440
A famous.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.600
Nothing you just heard was a brag.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.240
It killed all of us a little bit except Travis.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.040
Even, no, even I was not bragging.

14:03.040 --> 14:08.080
I have been in a cocoon for the last like three days.

14:08.080 --> 14:08.720
Yeah.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.400
Just recovering from having to talk to so many people.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.640
Travis did force himself into a picture with Kristen Bell

14:16.640 --> 14:19.600
and came back to us and was doubled over

14:19.600 --> 14:21.520
with the exhaustion of the effort.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.280
It took all of his power.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.160
Or maybe Kristen is a Shang Tsung

14:26.160 --> 14:28.320
and just got a little bit of that soul.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.400
Just got it, pulled it right in.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.320
If so, she's welcome to it.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.640
She knows she's given us all so much.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.080
Eat my soul, Kristen Bell.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.400
Yes, it's an advice show.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.680
And we help you, the listener, with your queries.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.320
You can send those because I don't think we've mentioned this

14:44.320 --> 14:46.000
in a couple of years.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.400
You can send those to mbmbam at maximumfund.org.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.200
Real queries for advice only, please.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.280
I'm a pizza delivery driver.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.720
And every time I deliver to a certain bar in town,

14:58.720 --> 15:02.000
they tell me I have to dance or they aren't going to tip me.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.280
I really need the money, so I humored them the first time

15:05.280 --> 15:06.800
and now they ask every time.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.320
And I deliver there twice a week.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.520
How do I get them to stop asking me to dance?

15:11.520 --> 15:15.200
Is there any way I can get a tip without dancing?

15:15.200 --> 15:16.560
And that's from Ben Vereen.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.560
No, mine would have made a lot of sense.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.520
That would have made a lot of sense.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.480
It's from Two-Stepping in Texas and not Ben Vereen.

15:24.480 --> 15:24.880
Yeah.

15:24.880 --> 15:31.920
Yeah, I think this is the wildest and worst bar.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.160
This is a bad bar.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.840
That's what it says outside.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.160
It's a two-step bar, so they probably play it off

15:40.160 --> 15:40.960
like they're chill.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.080
Like, hey, come on in.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.080
Now honky-tonk, ba-donk-a-donk.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.080
And step this way and then this way.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.360
And that's apparently dancing.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.320
Now you do it or else we will suspend your ability

15:52.320 --> 15:53.760
to pay bills this month.

15:53.760 --> 15:58.000
It seems like this is like one step removed from like

15:58.000 --> 16:01.600
the outlaw gang in town firing their pistol at your feet

16:01.600 --> 16:02.640
to make you dance.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.640
Yeah, it's a lot like-

16:04.640 --> 16:08.400
You want this $3, you're gonna have to dance.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.000
Let me ask you a question.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.760
Every time you pull up to this bar,

16:11.760 --> 16:15.040
do you knock over all of the motorcycles lined up outside

16:16.320 --> 16:18.640
and then you do it as a sort of distraction

16:18.640 --> 16:20.000
to save your hiney?

16:20.000 --> 16:20.960
This makes sense.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.080
I've seen this before.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.240
Yes, that makes sense to me.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.240
I just don't dance, like the next-

16:26.240 --> 16:28.320
Listen, you gotta pull that bandaid off

16:28.320 --> 16:29.840
and then we're like, you got a chance for this tip.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.520
You say, no, I don't.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.320
I'm an adult.

16:33.280 --> 16:33.680
And then just-

16:33.680 --> 16:35.680
That doesn't sound like the kind of person

16:35.680 --> 16:37.040
you want to party with.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.800
Yeah, I want to be able to party with my pizza delivery.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.640
Or maybe just say like, my boss said

16:40.640 --> 16:42.400
I'm not allowed to dance anymore.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.080
My doctor said I'm not allowed to dance anymore.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.040
I have a condition where I'm not allowed to dance.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.400
John Lithgow said I'm not allowed to dance anymore.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.280
In town, if you want to leave the town, I can go.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.880
Or if you know Kevin Bacon,

16:56.880 --> 16:58.640
I could probably make some arrangements.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.120
You could wear your cleats inside.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.160
Ah, fuck.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.200
The cleats.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.160
I can't.

17:06.160 --> 17:06.880
Oh, I didn't know.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.160
Ah, shoot.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.920
I just came from my big game.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.040
And before you ask, I won the kick.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.480
And yeah, I did have a pretty special touchdown dance.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.040
I did for-

17:17.040 --> 17:17.680
Ah, damn it.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.280
Okay, fine, you can see it.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.640
Yes, let's go outside.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.640
I'll do my special touchdown dance.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.160
And then you've made it worse.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.400
At that point, it's worse because now you have to come up

17:26.400 --> 17:30.560
with a special touchdown dance outside in your cleats.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.560
Maybe you get the first move.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.920
You get the upper hand and you say,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.200
do you want this pizza?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.960
You're gonna have to sing for it.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.120
Ah, okay.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.360
And then when they're like, that's ridiculous.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.320
I'm paying for it.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.640
Then you be like, yes, thank you.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.240
Now we're on the same page.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.880
You take the pizza and give me extra money, please.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.680
Just like I gave you extra cheese,

17:51.680 --> 17:52.960
you give me extra money.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.520
This is obviously untenable,

17:55.520 --> 17:58.480
but I am very glad that you mentioned that it is two-step,

17:58.480 --> 18:00.400
which is a fairly harmless dance.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.800
Because if you hadn't included the genre of dance,

18:02.800 --> 18:05.040
my worst fear would be like,

18:05.040 --> 18:06.960
yeah, go make it clap out on the floor.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.160
And then we'll see.

18:10.160 --> 18:10.800
Then we'll see.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.440
This is a miserable tip.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.640
Make that booty clap.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.400
Fucking tip everyone.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.600
Tip everyone.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.360
100% of the price of the meal every time.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.480
This is the new rule.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.680
It's rough out there.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.800
Tipping rules are easy.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.520
Now you just have to put exactly what the thing cost

18:26.240 --> 18:30.320
for everything that you purchased and every service,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.880
you tip 100% perfect.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.280
Easy.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.200
Easy to remember, easy to abide by.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.320
It's the same number.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.640
It's just the same number.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.720
And then when the revolution comes,

18:40.720 --> 18:42.000
it's all gonna work out, baby.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.200
Don't worry about it.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.360
And listen, this is just a helpful tip from me to you

18:45.360 --> 18:48.160
who I've been a delivery driver at different places.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.880
Tipping cash because they have to pay for their own gasoline.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.040
Yeah, baby.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.040
But then once the revolution comes,

18:55.040 --> 18:57.600
that cash is just gonna be stinky, dirty paper.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.320
Right.

18:58.320 --> 18:58.960
Correct.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.880
Then you're gonna want to start paying with credit card.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.400
I have a Yahoo here.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.200
Can I read it?

19:04.080 --> 19:04.480
Yeah, bud.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.280
It's from Graham.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.080
Roboc sent it in.

19:06.080 --> 19:06.720
Thanks, Graham.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.600
It's Yahoo answers you.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.320
They're anonymous.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.880
Chelsea asks,

19:10.880 --> 19:15.520
how do I remind myself to eat more kale?

19:16.960 --> 19:20.000
I blank, I'll fill it in here.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.840
I fucking used to love kale.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.120
That's it.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.400
What happened?

19:25.920 --> 19:27.200
What did happen?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.880
I've had situations.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.520
When I was a kid, I stayed at granny's house

19:34.240 --> 19:37.600
and I had myself a bean lunch

19:37.600 --> 19:39.680
and then I got sick in the toilet.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.960
A wet sickness.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.320
Do you know what I'm talking about?

19:42.320 --> 19:42.880
Yes.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.560
And then I didn't eat.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.680
Yes, sir.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.640
I didn't eat beans for like, no joke,

19:48.640 --> 19:50.160
six or seven years after that

19:50.160 --> 19:52.240
because I thought I was allergic to beans.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.240
People would ask me, do you have any allergies?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.320
And I would say, well, yes, I do.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.200
Beans.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.480
And they would say, are you positive?

20:00.480 --> 20:01.840
And then I would tell them the story

20:01.840 --> 20:03.920
that preceded this explanation.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.200
Griffin, that's wild.

20:07.920 --> 20:08.160
Yeah.

20:08.160 --> 20:08.960
That's wild.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.400
If you have a bad food time,

20:10.400 --> 20:12.000
you don't want to eat that food again.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.560
That's what I'm saying.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.760
But that's not the same as being allergic to a food.

20:16.400 --> 20:16.960
No, I know.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.600
I was wrong.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.720
I'm not allergic to beans.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.760
Now I bean it up all the fucking, all day long.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.400
Yeah.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.360
Get off my thing.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.720
Get back onto the question.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.200
Okay, so you're thinking that this person

20:27.200 --> 20:31.200
ate a kale lunch and had a bathroom, uh-oh.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.320
Had a wet sick, yeah.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.440
And that made them like stop eating kale

20:35.440 --> 20:36.720
and then they just went like,

20:36.720 --> 20:39.200
oh man, I should eat some kale again.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.320
But every time the opportunity for kale arises,

20:42.320 --> 20:43.440
they just forget.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.560
They eat something else.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.480
Oh, they forget about kale.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.000
Well, you can't look at life through the lens

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
of every meal is an opportunity for kale

20:50.480 --> 20:53.440
because you will absolutely just wear yourself down

20:53.440 --> 20:54.160
to the bone like that.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.200
Yeah, you miss 100% of the kales you don't eat.

20:57.200 --> 20:57.760
That's, yeah.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.480
That's what Brinsky said.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.960
And that's why he was so fucking yoked all the time.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.040
Yeah, also regular as shit.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.920
A little too regular maybe even.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.280
Couldn't make it through a game.

21:09.280 --> 21:09.600
Yeah.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.320
This person fucking-

21:10.320 --> 21:11.760
That was his undoing.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.400
I fucking used to love kale.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.960
How can I remind myself to eat more kale?

21:17.760 --> 21:19.200
Tie some kale around your finger.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.520
That's a good one, Trav, thank you.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.160
That's pretty good.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.600
Kale shirt.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.200
Can't get into bed wearing that.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.120
Maybe like hang some kale from the ceiling

21:29.120 --> 21:31.680
that you have to walk through to get to bed

21:31.680 --> 21:32.160
and then just-

21:32.160 --> 21:34.480
They should have kale barriers on stuff.

21:34.480 --> 21:34.800
Yeah.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.320
Like if you had a kale rope tied around every toilet

21:39.040 --> 21:40.400
that you had to gnaw your way through

21:40.400 --> 21:42.400
before you could use the bathroom, I love that.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.200
Just a big sheet of kale over the bathroom door

21:45.200 --> 21:46.400
that you have to eat your way through

21:46.400 --> 21:47.760
like you're in Metroid.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.120
Yes, hire a company to kidnap you and bury you in kale

21:51.120 --> 21:52.320
and you have to eat your way out.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.480
It's good too.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.040
If Mark Summers would just put the flag

21:57.040 --> 21:58.640
in a big pile of kale

21:58.640 --> 22:00.880
and you had to eat your way into the pile

22:00.880 --> 22:01.840
to win double there,

22:02.400 --> 22:04.320
I feel like that is something.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.680
Welcome to super healthy, super clean double dare.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.000
First, you're gonna go through this bath

22:10.000 --> 22:11.680
and then you're gonna eat some kale

22:11.680 --> 22:14.240
and get in some jammies and go to bed.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.200
Now listen, it's gonna get-

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
Point of order, it will get super sloppy.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.200
Just not during the show.

22:19.200 --> 22:19.680
Yes.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.600
Post-show is going to be an unfortunate sloppy situation.

22:23.600 --> 22:23.840
Yeah.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.920
At double dare after dark.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.720
Double dare nights.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.360
I wish there was such a thing

22:33.360 --> 22:34.880
and bear with me here, fellas,

22:34.880 --> 22:35.360
because it's gonna-

22:35.360 --> 22:36.400
As double dare nights,

22:36.400 --> 22:38.000
detective show starring Mark Summers.

22:38.000 --> 22:38.240
Yes.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.760
Looks like this one got a little too sloppy.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.680
He shoots someone in the head,

22:43.680 --> 22:46.400
he's like, I'm sending you to space camp.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.480
This is gonna get kind of cerebral.

22:51.200 --> 22:51.520
Okay.

22:52.640 --> 22:57.040
I wish there was such a thing as an edible tattoo.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.440
Okay.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.480
Well, I'm getting comfy.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.920
Okay, go on Wonka.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.120
It is kind of Wonka-esque,

23:03.120 --> 23:05.840
but if you like kale,

23:07.360 --> 23:08.240
if you were to ask me,

23:08.240 --> 23:10.640
Griffin, sit down in front of a Google doc

23:10.640 --> 23:14.640
and type out every kind of food that you like,

23:15.200 --> 23:16.960
I would get the easy stuff first.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.080
Pizza, taco, meatballs.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.240
But then if you asked me to keep going,

23:23.680 --> 23:24.640
I like broccoli, okay.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.760
A list, a ranking even of my favorite foods,

23:27.760 --> 23:28.800
I couldn't do it.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.880
And so what if every time you tried something

23:30.880 --> 23:32.800
and you were like, oh my God, what is that?

23:32.800 --> 23:35.360
And somebody's like, that is ceviche, my man.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.440
I'll be like, get out the pen.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.600
And then I would tattoo it in my arm.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.760
So anytime I got hungry, I could look down

23:41.760 --> 23:42.960
and be like, ooh, what is that?

23:42.960 --> 23:44.160
Oh, that's right, ceviche.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.760
What did ceviche taste like?

23:45.760 --> 23:46.640
And then you give it a little.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.360
I think you're really close to auto cannibalism, Griffin.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.240
No, you don't eat it.

23:52.240 --> 23:52.800
You don't eat it.

23:52.800 --> 23:53.360
You don't eat it.

23:53.360 --> 23:53.920
You don't eat it.

23:53.920 --> 23:54.400
You lick it.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.160
You understand.

23:56.160 --> 24:01.840
You understand that you have gone into human evolution

24:01.840 --> 24:06.320
and have basically replaced memory,

24:06.320 --> 24:10.400
our ability to remember, with a fun fruit snack

24:10.400 --> 24:11.520
for the whole family.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.080
Not a fruit.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.280
This is what you're saying.

24:13.280 --> 24:18.960
You're trading memory for the ability to eat your own flesh.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.560
No, I'm saying you trade off.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.200
Now I don't have to keep my favorite foods inside my brain.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.320
I keep that on my arm.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.120
Now my brain has more room for the 800 Pokemon that exist.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.080
And we can get super hyper concentrated flavor ink, right?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.240
And you'll be like, yeah, let me get ceviche,

24:36.240 --> 24:37.920
but do it in ceviche flavored ink.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.040
And so they would do it

24:39.040 --> 24:40.720
and it would be really fucking concentrated.

24:40.720 --> 24:41.680
So it lasts a long time,

24:41.680 --> 24:45.600
but you will have to get a re-up every like three months or so.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.400
Now, how do you decide-

24:46.400 --> 24:47.680
We all assumed flavoring, Griffin.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.880
I mean, we all assumed that.

24:48.880 --> 24:49.600
That was obvious.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.920
Yeah, how do you determine,

24:51.920 --> 24:54.160
like how much do you have to like a food

24:54.160 --> 24:57.360
for it to, is it like the more you like a food,

24:57.360 --> 24:58.720
the bigger the tattoo is?

24:58.720 --> 25:01.200
Does every food get a spot or is it like-

25:01.200 --> 25:03.680
I think it's gotta be quick, right?

25:03.680 --> 25:06.400
I think every restaurant has to offer the tattoo service.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.240
Oh, but that's awkward.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.280
They're gonna come over and be like,

25:09.280 --> 25:12.000
so do you want a tattoo of our world famous fries or not?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.520
But you didn't like the fries.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.400
I didn't.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.760
The truffle oil wasn't, no.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.040
So no tattoo for me, you think?

25:17.040 --> 25:19.120
No, I think the tattoo would be extremely rare.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.080
Somebody eats these truffle fries and they go, yummy!

25:22.080 --> 25:23.440
Hey!

25:23.440 --> 25:25.760
And then they just bring out the whole cart

25:25.760 --> 25:28.160
and get them going and get it on the arm.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.440
I think it doesn't have to go on the arm,

25:29.440 --> 25:31.520
but it does have to go on a lickable body part.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.160
Yeah, it can't be the elbow or like the ear lobe.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.320
Yeah, or your own butt.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.160
You can't lick your own butt?

25:39.600 --> 25:40.320
Haven't tried.

25:41.200 --> 25:41.760
Do it now.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.200
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

25:47.200 --> 25:54.160
Well, I can't eat ass while I podcast, Trav.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.760
Fucking eat ass while you podcast seems like a t-shirt.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.880
It should have a big fucking eagle on it

26:00.880 --> 26:05.120
and you a rad thumbs up.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.880
Or it could be like the keep calm and carry on,

26:08.880 --> 26:18.960
which says eat ass and podcast.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.080
Big Dogs is back with a thrilling new line.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.280
Oh, shit.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.920
That's our new podcast merch is just gonna be

26:25.920 --> 26:27.520
Big Dogs inspired collection.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.160
Oh my God.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.640
Holy shit.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.160
Should we do one more little question?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.160
Yeah, I got one here for you.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.800
My partner and I are out for dinner at a local pizzeria.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.480
This is our second pizza themed question.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.720
Listen, sometimes I put together a question list

26:44.720 --> 26:45.760
when I'm hungry, okay?

26:46.560 --> 26:48.160
We don't need to identify that.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.280
Okay, so the place is somewhat trendy

26:51.280 --> 26:54.000
and caters to young hip clientele.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.360
We've already ordered

26:55.360 --> 26:57.520
and we're told it might be a 30 minute wait.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.560
The people at the table next to us just left,

27:00.560 --> 27:03.840
leaving behind three untouched slices of pepperoni pizza.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.600
No, next question.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.040
No, next question.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.880
My partner and I are both quite hungry.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.680
It's a busy night.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.760
We would almost certainly be seen by other diners

27:11.760 --> 27:12.640
if we went for it.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.520
Should we grab the pizza

27:15.520 --> 27:18.000
before someone comes to clear the table?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.240
And that's from Pining for Pizza in Little Rock.

27:20.880 --> 27:24.800
And they have decided to solve this immediate problem

27:25.360 --> 27:27.680
by sending an email to a weekly podcast.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.360
And I salute you for that.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.320
Now, first and foremost,

27:30.320 --> 27:31.600
I wanna go ahead and get out of the way.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.000
Food waste is a real issue in our country.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.080
Thank you, yes Travis.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.040
Why is it weird to eat that pizza

27:39.040 --> 27:40.720
that no one else is gonna take on the table?

27:41.280 --> 27:42.400
It's not suddenly,

27:42.400 --> 27:44.240
like if they were still sitting there

27:44.240 --> 27:44.880
and they picked,

27:44.880 --> 27:46.400
like the people who are at that table,

27:46.400 --> 27:48.160
picked up one of those three slices,

27:48.160 --> 27:49.920
no one else in the restaurant would be like,

27:49.920 --> 27:53.840
ew, but if you reach across a two foot gap

27:53.840 --> 27:55.440
to grab that piece of pizza,

27:55.440 --> 27:56.480
you're a monster.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.320
You have to assume,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.440
okay, I wanna take the social thing out of it.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.080
I always, everyone is always assuming

28:06.080 --> 28:07.040
that they're fucking up.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.520
And everyone also assumes,

28:09.520 --> 28:11.600
the assumption that everyone makes

28:12.160 --> 28:14.000
is that everyone else knows what they're doing.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.520
And it's a faulty supposition,

28:17.520 --> 28:19.040
but it's one we're constantly making

28:19.040 --> 28:20.560
on a subconscious basis.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.680
You have to work extremely hard

28:24.240 --> 28:26.480
to make people think you don't know what you're doing.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.360
If you walk over and you pick up some za off a table

28:29.360 --> 28:30.960
that was abandoned by some other people,

28:30.960 --> 28:33.200
everyone will just assume you're doing it.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.400
Assume it was agreed upon beforehand,

28:36.400 --> 28:37.680
like they texted you,

28:38.240 --> 28:39.840
they're your cousin,

28:39.840 --> 28:41.040
it could be anything.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.760
Everyone will just take that aspect out of it.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.240
So then we're left with like a hygiene question, right?

28:47.360 --> 28:50.640
That is, that I think is more debatable.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.680
No, I mean, hygiene is not a question for me.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.560
Hygiene is not a question.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.760
This is good pizza, folks.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.360
This is good pizza, folks.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.840
It's not like they slobbered all over it.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.480
Maybe they did,

29:00.480 --> 29:02.160
but you gotta just sort of play the odds

29:02.160 --> 29:05.200
when you're doing stuff like this.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.280
Food waste is a problem, Travis, yes.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
And we are basically,

29:10.480 --> 29:14.320
we're all basically already a bunch of just dirty dogs.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.480
So just go for it.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.360
Go for it.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.160
Go eat this.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.440
And if somebody gets on you,

29:19.440 --> 29:23.440
just like throw them a newspaper and say,

29:23.440 --> 29:25.840
we're all already dirty dogs.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.920
So it really doesn't matter anymore.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.800
Are you throwing the newspaper in like a fetch kind of way?

29:30.800 --> 29:33.520
It can be a joke like that, yeah.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.600
But they do need to read it

29:35.600 --> 29:37.360
and then read it front to back.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.640
And I don't know where you live,

29:38.640 --> 29:40.240
but you're gonna make it to the end of that newspaper

29:40.240 --> 29:42.720
and be like, damn, we're all dirty dogs.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.760
So it doesn't matter if you eat the scraps, does it?

29:45.760 --> 29:48.560
Well, I think the only concern would be

29:49.440 --> 29:52.320
that you might get asked to leave the restaurant,

29:52.880 --> 29:55.440
but I also don't think anyone working at the restaurant

29:55.440 --> 29:57.120
would want to do that.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.960
Like they'd have to walk over and say,

29:58.960 --> 30:00.400
did you eat the pizza at that table?

30:00.400 --> 30:01.840
And you would say, no.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.480
And they would say, okay.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.840
And then they'd leave you alone

30:05.840 --> 30:07.760
because that is as much confrontation

30:07.760 --> 30:09.840
as any human being ever wants.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.640
Now, unless they, unless,

30:12.640 --> 30:14.720
sorry, I gave you the window.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.760
Oh, unless.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.520
Justin, you're still there.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.080
You gotta leave.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.600
You can't leave me with unsatisfied.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.480
Unless they wanted to eat that pizza in the secret back.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.680
Now that is the thing.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.400
And that's the thing.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.280
Juice, when you worked at the OG,

30:29.280 --> 30:32.320
were you snarfing down soup salad,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.480
bread bowl, breadstick, whatever?

30:34.480 --> 30:39.200
I got hired at the OG as a dishwasher.

30:39.200 --> 30:39.760
So yes.

30:39.760 --> 30:44.240
And I went back to meet the man who would be training me.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.920
I watched him pick up a cup of minestrone off a plate

30:49.920 --> 30:52.000
and fucking jam it like a shooter.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.760
And then he asked, what department are you working in?

30:55.760 --> 30:57.600
And I said, I'm a line chef.

30:57.600 --> 30:57.840
Yes.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.800
Yes.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.640
Because I couldn't study under this man,

31:02.640 --> 31:05.920
even though I celebrate him for that.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.920
I couldn't live up to this person.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.440
So I lied and said I'd been hired as a chef.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.000
And that's how I got to be a chef at the Olive Garden.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.960
That anecdote I've told probably 30 times.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.520
I've never gotten more than a polite chuckle.

31:21.520 --> 31:27.680
But I submit that if I did become a chef in my life,

31:27.680 --> 31:31.520
after that, it would be an extremely good story.

31:31.520 --> 31:31.840
Yes.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.320
Yeah.

31:32.320 --> 31:32.560
Yes.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.960
I'm just saying the value of the story is diminished

31:34.960 --> 31:36.640
because I worked there for a month and quit

31:36.640 --> 31:38.640
because I was tired of stinking of garlic.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.880
You smelled so bad.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.680
You smelled like fucking Van Helsing.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.080
You smelled so much of the garlic.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.680
I would like to pitch a new idea.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.000
I recently, while in San Diego, went to a breakfast place

31:54.000 --> 31:56.800
and I got some pancakes and as is always the case,

31:56.800 --> 31:59.360
they brought me three huge flappy jacks

31:59.360 --> 32:01.040
and I only wanted one.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.760
And I kept thinking I should have asked around first

32:03.760 --> 32:05.440
to see if anyone around me was thinking

32:05.440 --> 32:07.440
of ordering the same pancakes.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.840
And I could have just like, I don't know,

32:09.840 --> 32:13.520
ride shared these pancakes with people sitting around me

32:13.520 --> 32:16.080
and said like, I only want one of these three.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.160
Does anybody else just want to go ahead

32:18.160 --> 32:19.920
and eat one of the other ones?

32:20.560 --> 32:23.200
And then I don't have to feel bad about ordering them.

32:23.200 --> 32:27.200
I'm saying maybe we ride share pancakes from now on.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.400
And pizza too, something that comes in easily dividable.

32:30.400 --> 32:34.400
You know, like, let's, hey, when you're here, your family,

32:34.960 --> 32:37.280
let's treat it like family and share fucking pancakes

32:37.280 --> 32:39.200
and pizza, but just that.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.360
Let's take a break from this.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.080
Thank God.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.360
It's all very good.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.160
I love this.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.680
But let's take a break to talk about the money.

32:47.680 --> 33:01.840
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

33:01.840 --> 33:02.320
Who's there?

33:02.320 --> 33:02.640
Who's there?

33:03.200 --> 33:03.920
Whoa.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.040
I should have let you do it.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.880
Yeah, were you calling yourself?

33:06.880 --> 33:07.840
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.280
Don't answer it.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.440
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.240
It's him again.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.520
No, it's him again.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.360
Oh no, this is a, sorry, this is a doorbell.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.680
Well, they're just ringing it in a pattern

33:17.680 --> 33:19.120
that makes it sound like a telephone.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.560
Okay, try it again.

33:20.560 --> 33:20.960
We'll get it.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.080
Yeah, we'll get it this time.

33:22.080 --> 33:22.880
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.160
No, thank you.

33:25.280 --> 33:25.840
We're good.

33:25.840 --> 33:26.560
Thank you.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.880
Why don't you look at the app and see the camera

33:28.880 --> 33:29.680
and see who it is?

33:30.320 --> 33:31.200
I did.

33:31.200 --> 33:31.920
And it was you.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.360
So you were dismissed.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.960
We sent you straight to voice mail, which is the modern sort

33:36.960 --> 33:39.920
of fun, kinky way of saying we didn't answer the door.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.000
All right, well, I guess I'll take this big briefcase

33:42.000 --> 33:45.040
full of money and cereal somewhere else.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.960
Ooh, I use the ring.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.880
Ring is a magical doorbell that goes in the front of your door.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.680
And no one knows how it works and no one knows how it works,

33:53.680 --> 33:55.920
but it has AC video and two way audio.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.840
You can set motion detection.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.880
Someone showed up in front door.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.600
You're not only going to get a notification that they're there.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.520
You're going to be able to pop the camera open and see like,

34:04.080 --> 34:05.200
what do you want?

34:05.200 --> 34:06.000
What are you doing?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.600
Who is that right now?

34:08.320 --> 34:11.520
If you're out and about, I've answered my door from across

34:11.520 --> 34:16.000
the country before and said, just leave the weed under the map.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.440
One thing that I like about it is that if there's,

34:22.800 --> 34:25.040
I'll just say shit going down in your neighborhood,

34:25.760 --> 34:28.400
there are these neighborhood safety alerts where you see like,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.960
hey, a bunch of people are getting robbed over here.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.440
You should try to stay cool.

34:33.440 --> 34:37.200
Try to be cool about it and not tell the cops.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.000
No, you can't tell.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.120
You should tell the cops.

34:39.120 --> 34:43.200
But like, you get those sorts of neighborhood safety alerts.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.480
They got a deal for our listeners.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.560
If you go to ring.com slash my brother,

34:46.560 --> 34:50.080
you can get a special deal on a ring starter kit,

34:50.080 --> 34:56.080
which is the video doorbell and motion activated floodlight camera.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.240
You can get that starter kit and save like 50 bucks,

35:01.520 --> 35:02.240
which is awesome.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.680
And if you want to get some more equipment,

35:05.680 --> 35:08.400
you can also save more at ring.com slash my brother.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.640
I use the thing literally every day.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.200
It is the best.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.240
And it is available for you now at ring.com slash my brother.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.760
Gonna tell you about Blue Apron now.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.680
So here it comes.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.600
This is the cooking box.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.280
It's gonna have lots of stuff in it

35:25.280 --> 35:26.640
and you're gonna be confused by it.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.360
Why did I just get a big thing of asparagus and meat?

35:29.360 --> 35:30.240
Don't freak out.

35:30.240 --> 35:30.880
Look at the box.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.840
It says Blue Apron on it.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.720
That's how you know that the payload has been delivered.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.680
It's not a threat.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.960
It's not a threat.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.560
This is what I'm going to do to you.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.080
It is a box that gives you that,

35:40.080 --> 35:44.480
those ingredients exclusively meat and asparagus only

35:44.480 --> 35:46.160
and then it teaches you how to use it

35:46.160 --> 35:47.920
in all kinds of different ways.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.680
That's one of my favorite things about Blue Apron.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.440
It gives you all the ingredients you need,

35:51.440 --> 35:52.720
none that you don't.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.840
There's never like, what?

35:53.840 --> 35:55.120
There's just a zucchini in here.

35:55.120 --> 35:55.920
What do I do with it?

35:55.920 --> 35:57.440
A fucking golf ball in here.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.400
Zucchini is neither meat nor asparagus.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.280
And those are the two things that are available

36:03.280 --> 36:05.680
in every Blue Apron box and only those two things.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.040
Now here's what's going to throw you.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.080
They have started offering the Beyond Burger,

36:10.080 --> 36:12.240
which is a plant-based patty, right?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.800
So you're going to be like, wait, is this the burger

36:14.800 --> 36:16.160
or is this the asparagus?

36:16.160 --> 36:17.440
And you'll never know.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.600
Yeah, yeah, it's confusing.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.800
So anyway, they make cooking a sustainable part

36:22.800 --> 36:26.080
of your weekly routine and all their meals

36:26.080 --> 36:27.440
are carefully designed and tested

36:27.440 --> 36:28.640
by the Test Kitchen chefs.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.160
Boy, I bet that's a good job,

36:30.160 --> 36:32.400
snacking around on these good burgers and stuff.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.880
They use unique specialty ingredients

36:34.880 --> 36:37.200
to bring chef quality recipes to your dinner table.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.080
We've all used it.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.120
I learned how to cook from it.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.280
It's really, it's the jam.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.240
It's the shit.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.440
Here's some recipes.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.960
Cajun shrimp and corn pancakes

36:44.960 --> 36:46.400
with sauteed summer vegetables.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.440
Don't mind if I yum.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.760
Steaks and sauteed vegetables

36:49.760 --> 36:51.120
with cheesy mashed potatoes.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.680
Can't guarantee that those are asparagus.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.120
I'm looking, they're green and long.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.720
So maybe, maybe.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.120
Anyway, if you want to start making delicious

36:59.120 --> 37:00.400
brag-worthy meals at home without-

37:00.400 --> 37:02.880
They also have stuff that are like non-meat based,

37:02.880 --> 37:04.160
just too, just throwing that out.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.920
You know, yellow tomato and zucchini pasta.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.240
Griffin just chose to list off

37:08.240 --> 37:10.160
two of the like eight different options

37:10.160 --> 37:11.760
that both contained meat,

37:11.760 --> 37:14.000
but there are non-meat options.

37:14.000 --> 37:14.960
They look badass.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.720
You can check out this week's menu

37:16.720 --> 37:18.080
and get $60 off when you visit

37:18.080 --> 37:19.440
blueapron.com slash my brother.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.880
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.200
Hi, I'm Dave.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.160
Hi, I'm Graham.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.400
And we're two house DJs

37:30.400 --> 37:32.880
who have been trapped inside our drum machine.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.280
We love it here and we'd love if you stopped by

37:35.280 --> 37:37.120
and visited us every week

37:37.120 --> 37:38.960
on Stop Podcasting Yourself

37:38.960 --> 37:41.280
here on MaximumFun.org.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.160
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada

37:44.160 --> 37:46.320
and listen to our show or perish.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.280
Stop podcasting yourself

37:49.280 --> 38:02.960
on MaximumFun.org.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.600
My lord.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.960
I, yay verily, want too much.

38:11.760 --> 38:12.260
Huzzah!

38:13.520 --> 38:16.160
I, yay verily, want too much.

38:16.960 --> 38:17.460
Huzzah!

38:17.460 --> 38:20.500
It's a Ren Faire version

38:20.500 --> 38:21.700
of the Munch Squad theme song.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.980
It's a podcast within a podcast.

38:23.780 --> 38:25.780
Usually I read press releases

38:25.780 --> 38:28.580
before I do them

38:28.580 --> 38:30.900
and I'm gonna roll a cosmic dice here

38:31.460 --> 38:33.300
on this episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me

38:33.300 --> 38:35.300
and tell you about Taco Bell

38:35.940 --> 38:37.700
revealing spicy details

38:37.700 --> 38:39.140
of its new pop-up hotel.

38:39.940 --> 38:40.900
Oh my god.

38:40.900 --> 38:41.400
Okay.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.340
So yeah, so they're getting in the hotels

38:44.340 --> 38:47.140
with, it's called the Bell.

38:47.140 --> 38:49.780
Now we've definitely not talked about this before

38:49.780 --> 38:50.900
because god that's weird.

38:51.780 --> 38:52.580
Yeah, no.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.780
I mean we may have mentioned it

38:53.780 --> 38:56.260
but we didn't have these fucking spicy details,

38:56.260 --> 38:56.660
Trav.

38:56.660 --> 38:57.140
The Bell.

38:57.140 --> 38:57.700
Okay.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.300
A Taco Bell hotel and resort

38:59.300 --> 39:01.060
opening in Palm Springs in August.

39:01.780 --> 39:03.940
It's a limited time experience

39:03.940 --> 39:08.500
but as this press release certainly reminds me

39:08.500 --> 39:10.100
all things are limited time

39:10.100 --> 39:12.180
and this is a great application

39:12.180 --> 39:14.580
of the time that you have on earth

39:14.580 --> 39:16.340
is to go to the Taco Bell hotel

39:16.340 --> 39:18.820
which is called the Bell.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.660
Available for a limited time.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.020
What is gonna make the Bell

39:25.380 --> 39:26.820
such an incredible experience?

39:26.820 --> 39:28.180
Is that what I hear you asking?

39:28.180 --> 39:30.340
What are your top questions about the Bell?

39:31.060 --> 39:32.180
Are you asking us?

39:32.180 --> 39:33.140
Oh yeah, no.

39:33.140 --> 39:34.340
Hey, it was kind of rhetorical

39:34.340 --> 39:35.540
but I was also curious.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.060
Are there on-site restaurants?

39:39.060 --> 39:39.940
Yes, thank you.

39:39.940 --> 39:40.900
The food, yes.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.340
Yes, here's what's gonna be the best Taco Bell

39:46.580 --> 39:50.100
and there's also an unexpected take

39:50.100 --> 39:51.940
on a resort poolside menu.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.820
I guess unexpected when you're staying

39:54.820 --> 39:57.620
at the Taco Bell hotel means not Taco Bell.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.780
So there's the two things you could do there

39:59.780 --> 40:02.740
at Taco Bell and not Taco Bell.

40:02.740 --> 40:07.060
So you're looking at maybe a toasted cheddar club

40:07.060 --> 40:11.860
with hand-breaded crispy chicken, jalapeno, bacon, avocado,

40:11.860 --> 40:13.220
sharp cheddar, it doesn't matter.

40:13.220 --> 40:19.620
Or an avocado tostada served on local multi-grain toast

40:19.620 --> 40:21.860
with avocado breakfast radish.

40:21.860 --> 40:24.020
So this press release is bold enough

40:24.020 --> 40:26.900
to imagine a world where I would be the sort of person

40:26.900 --> 40:28.980
that would go to the Taco Bell hotel

40:28.980 --> 40:32.660
and then say, excuse me, is this spread local?

40:32.660 --> 40:37.700
Mm-hmm, excuse me, is this local multi-grain toast

40:37.700 --> 40:39.060
from the region?

40:39.060 --> 40:41.540
But it also implies that there is a person who's like,

40:41.540 --> 40:45.060
I'm gonna go out of my way to stay at the Taco Bell hotel

40:45.060 --> 40:47.780
but I don't like Taco Bell food.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.780
It's just closest to my convention.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.580
Think outside the bun, purchase local.

40:55.780 --> 41:00.340
So there's gonna be a Baja Blast birthday freeze

41:00.340 --> 41:03.620
celebrating the 15th anniversary.

41:03.620 --> 41:08.260
It's gonna be served in the first ever freeze lounge

41:08.260 --> 41:10.100
to keep things chill.

41:10.900 --> 41:13.860
So I guess this is a very cold lounge,

41:14.420 --> 41:18.180
perfect for enjoying the Baja Blast.

41:18.180 --> 41:20.820
I would argue we already have those

41:20.820 --> 41:22.260
and they're called Morgues.

41:22.260 --> 41:26.100
But there will be an onsite morgue perfect

41:26.100 --> 41:27.780
for enjoying a Baja Blast.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.900
Fantastic, here's a quote, I got a quote.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.100
All right.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.260
It's from Rene Piscotti.

41:34.260 --> 41:36.740
He's the executive chef of the Bell.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.020
They have one of those?

41:38.020 --> 41:38.820
Hell yeah.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.300
Let's be honest, let's be honest,

41:41.300 --> 41:44.260
food is the best part of traveling.

41:44.260 --> 41:46.500
A lot of effort and homework goes into finding out

41:46.500 --> 41:49.220
the best places to eat near where you're staying.

41:49.220 --> 41:50.340
What is this accent?

41:50.340 --> 41:50.900
I love it.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.820
It's Rene Piscotti.

41:52.820 --> 41:56.260
But with the Bell, we thought of everything for you.

41:56.260 --> 41:57.780
You mean Taco Bell food?

41:58.820 --> 42:01.460
From welcome beverages to room service

42:02.260 --> 42:04.660
to build your own breakfast tacos

42:04.660 --> 42:06.340
and surprises throughout.

42:06.340 --> 42:06.820
What?

42:06.820 --> 42:07.780
Whoa, wait, hold on.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.740
You can't just say surprises throughout.

42:10.740 --> 42:12.260
Surprises without.

42:13.620 --> 42:16.500
Many of which feature local ingredients

42:17.220 --> 42:19.540
like our horchata date smoothie.

42:20.420 --> 42:23.620
We're curating the ultimate Taco Bell food experience.

42:23.620 --> 42:26.260
So the Bell is a hotel that has the bravery

42:26.260 --> 42:29.380
to look at the Taco Bell menu and say,

42:29.380 --> 42:30.660
well, certainly not this.

42:32.740 --> 42:35.860
Certainly you didn't intend on consuming this.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.700
Do you guys know what a,

42:37.700 --> 42:39.860
I think it's pronounced Hallow Klein is?

42:39.860 --> 42:40.020
No.

42:40.900 --> 42:44.660
This is when usually in like an underwater cave

42:44.660 --> 42:48.340
like really salty salt water and fresh water

42:49.700 --> 42:50.980
like refuse to mix.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.460
And so it creates like a visible surface

42:53.460 --> 42:56.500
from one water to the other that you can see.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.020
And I'm wondering if there's one of these

42:58.020 --> 43:00.900
at the front door of the Taco Bell hotel

43:00.900 --> 43:02.420
because of how many farts,

43:02.420 --> 43:05.700
like concentrated condensed like fart air

43:05.700 --> 43:07.860
is in there that you literally can see

43:07.860 --> 43:11.140
like a visible air surface.

43:11.140 --> 43:12.820
Yes, welcome to the hotel.

43:12.820 --> 43:15.780
I do have to warn you, our air is flavor blasted.

43:15.780 --> 43:19.700
So you're going to need to wear this special diving mask.

43:19.700 --> 43:21.300
It's local farts.

43:21.300 --> 43:23.860
Farts, locally sourced farts.

43:23.860 --> 43:25.620
These are farm to table farts.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.660
The fun, the fun you ask?

43:28.660 --> 43:30.020
Well, they've got the fun.

43:30.580 --> 43:33.780
While daytime DJs play jams,

43:34.580 --> 43:38.260
this is basically someone's nephew hooked up Spotify.

43:38.260 --> 43:40.180
While daytime DJs play jams,

43:40.980 --> 43:42.820
surprise performances will kick off

43:42.820 --> 43:45.300
after the sun goes down for guests at the bell.

43:46.100 --> 43:48.180
Fans can bring home the same vibes

43:48.180 --> 43:51.300
to their own summer plans with curated playlists

43:51.300 --> 43:55.380
from Feed the Beat artists, a Taco Bell program

43:55.380 --> 43:58.660
that has helped more than 1,600 artists and bands

43:58.660 --> 44:00.180
discover new fans.

44:04.820 --> 44:06.820
And ladies and gentlemen, coming back to the stage

44:06.820 --> 44:08.740
for the fourth time today, Eddie Money.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.220
Eddie's back.

44:11.220 --> 44:12.100
Hey, what's up?

44:12.100 --> 44:13.540
Yeah, they asked me to do it again.

44:14.580 --> 44:15.700
And I said, so here I am.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.300
I said, do you got any more Crunchwraps?

44:17.300 --> 44:18.660
And they laughed and laughed.

44:18.660 --> 44:19.220
Anyway.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.620
I've got two tickets to paradise.

44:22.500 --> 44:23.860
They didn't answer my question,

44:23.860 --> 44:27.220
but I'm assuming they're out.

44:28.420 --> 44:32.820
I want to go to this place with a desire

44:33.460 --> 44:35.300
that I'm not sure I can quantify

44:36.020 --> 44:37.700
with the sort of linguistic tools

44:37.700 --> 44:40.420
that we trade in on this show.

44:40.420 --> 44:44.340
We very rarely get into sort of poetry

44:44.340 --> 44:48.580
or epic narrative at all.

44:48.580 --> 44:50.420
And I feel like that's what I would need

44:50.420 --> 44:52.580
to sort of communicate the desire

44:52.580 --> 44:55.620
with which I really, really, really, really

44:55.620 --> 44:56.820
want to go to the bell.

44:56.820 --> 44:57.220
Yeah.

44:57.220 --> 44:59.300
If I may, Justin, it seems to me

44:59.300 --> 45:01.060
to be a bit of a siren song

45:01.700 --> 45:03.780
drawing you into the cheesy ocean

45:03.780 --> 45:05.620
to crash upon the nacho rocks.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.740
Like, you know it will be your undoing.

45:08.740 --> 45:09.620
Yeah.

45:09.620 --> 45:10.980
But you're drawn to it.

45:10.980 --> 45:14.100
Let me remind you, you're going to have to sleep here.

45:14.820 --> 45:15.060
Yeah.

45:16.020 --> 45:16.900
That is hard.

45:16.900 --> 45:17.940
That is hard.

45:17.940 --> 45:20.020
The other thing that I'm struggling with

45:20.020 --> 45:22.260
is I've eaten at Taco Bell many times.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.940
My reaction physically and mentally

45:25.940 --> 45:27.940
after that is always never again.

45:28.820 --> 45:31.460
I swear to myself, never again.

45:31.460 --> 45:33.700
But now I'm sleeping in a place

45:33.700 --> 45:34.980
where they make it.

45:34.980 --> 45:37.460
I'm sleeping at the belly of the beast,

45:37.460 --> 45:38.100
as it were.

45:39.140 --> 45:40.340
That's hard for me.

45:40.340 --> 45:41.460
That's tough.

45:41.460 --> 45:42.340
Can I read a Yahoo?

45:42.340 --> 45:42.580
Yeah.

45:43.140 --> 45:43.780
Yes, please.

45:43.780 --> 45:46.020
Yeah, there's a Taco Bell gift shop, by the way,

45:46.020 --> 45:47.700
where you can buy, it's got,

45:47.700 --> 45:48.740
I'm looking at right now,

45:49.300 --> 45:51.460
a Taco Bell is life tie clip,

45:52.020 --> 45:53.220
which imagines a world

45:53.220 --> 45:55.300
where you would be someone with a Taco Bell

45:55.300 --> 45:56.900
is life tie clip,

45:56.900 --> 45:58.980
but also have any use for a tie

45:58.980 --> 46:00.660
at any point in your life whatsoever.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.700
Well, I can think of a couple.

46:04.660 --> 46:05.380
Okay.

46:05.380 --> 46:06.660
CEO of Taco Bell.

46:08.020 --> 46:09.140
Court date.

46:09.140 --> 46:10.980
Be at bail, bail arrangement.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.980
Okay, here is a Yahoo.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.420
Gosh, these are all kind of food related.

46:16.420 --> 46:17.940
Graham Roebuck also sent this one in.

46:17.940 --> 46:19.220
It's a hungry app.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.300
It's from Yahoo Answers user Ernesto,

46:21.300 --> 46:21.860
who asks,

46:23.140 --> 46:26.900
which food awakens the beast inside you?

46:26.900 --> 46:27.700
Oh, yeah.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.740
Which food awakens the beast inside you?

46:32.740 --> 46:33.860
Let's get this out of the way.

46:33.860 --> 46:35.940
I have, and this will just be a blanket

46:35.940 --> 46:37.620
sort of crude humor joke,

46:37.620 --> 46:39.780
but I do have irritable bowel syndrome.

46:39.780 --> 46:40.820
So you can make an argument

46:40.820 --> 46:43.700
that you're describing most foods.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.860
More like irritable beast syndrome.

46:46.500 --> 46:48.820
That makes it cooler for sure, for sure, for sure.

46:49.460 --> 46:52.260
You've got an irritable beast in your system.

46:52.980 --> 46:54.340
It feels like it sometimes certainly,

46:54.340 --> 46:56.420
but let's not go down that route

46:56.420 --> 46:59.140
because I feel like the Taco Bell one

46:59.140 --> 47:01.940
used up all of our resources.

47:01.940 --> 47:03.380
For me, it's kale.

47:04.180 --> 47:04.580
Okay.

47:04.580 --> 47:08.100
When I eat kale, I feel like a wild beast.

47:08.820 --> 47:12.820
That's also true when I eat sticks of cinnamon or rocks.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.780
Here's a, this is gonna complicate things

47:15.780 --> 47:17.860
maybe a little bit, but are pills food?

47:19.780 --> 47:22.260
Do pills count as food?

47:22.260 --> 47:23.540
Do they unleash the beast?

47:24.340 --> 47:25.460
In a manner of speaking.

47:26.020 --> 47:26.580
I see.

47:27.220 --> 47:30.980
A beast who's not as anxious as a non-beast is.

47:30.980 --> 47:31.780
Ah, yes.

47:31.780 --> 47:34.500
Compared to what the non-beast is,

47:34.500 --> 47:37.060
I am currently and have been for a while now

47:37.060 --> 47:38.340
beasting the fuck out.

47:39.060 --> 47:44.020
That is true with Travis, anxiety Travis and sad Travis,

47:44.020 --> 47:46.660
who is now doing okay, Travis.

47:46.660 --> 47:48.260
The regular Travis, yeah.

47:48.260 --> 47:49.860
The fucking beast.

47:51.060 --> 47:54.500
Oh, a wild man who can focus on homework.

47:54.500 --> 47:57.540
Yeah, I can get out of bed.

47:57.540 --> 47:58.500
I'm the beast.

47:58.500 --> 48:05.060
Whoa, I care more about the needs of others.

48:05.060 --> 48:07.540
I wanna hear more about Travis's pull of homework.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.140
That's relevant to your day to day.

48:11.140 --> 48:12.580
Dude, that's all that work is now.

48:12.580 --> 48:14.020
You know, I work from home.

48:14.020 --> 48:15.220
It's all homework now.

48:16.020 --> 48:17.700
Dang, that's great.

48:17.700 --> 48:18.900
That's so good, dude.

48:18.900 --> 48:24.020
But what food makes you go wild with power and fury

48:24.020 --> 48:29.540
and you can be stronger because of the food?

48:29.540 --> 48:34.100
If I eat the right amount of boneless buffalo wings,

48:34.100 --> 48:34.820
I feel that way.

48:34.820 --> 48:38.020
The problem is I don't know what the right amount is

48:38.020 --> 48:39.620
and it changes every time.

48:40.820 --> 48:42.260
It's a moving target.

48:42.260 --> 48:44.500
One too little and I'm still hungry,

48:44.500 --> 48:48.180
one too many and I instantly feel like death.

48:48.180 --> 48:50.420
Have you guys tried vegetables?

48:50.420 --> 48:50.920
Yeah.

48:50.920 --> 48:55.480
Yeah, every show we've ever done for the past few years,

48:55.480 --> 49:00.360
we request that they put some vegetables backstage

49:01.160 --> 49:02.760
and then at the end of every show,

49:02.760 --> 49:07.080
we like to take them and float them on the nearest body of water

49:07.080 --> 49:08.840
and then shoot a flaming arrow into them

49:08.840 --> 49:10.200
and watch as they sail off.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.640
And then we say,

49:11.640 --> 49:14.760
maybe next show we'll definitely eat these vegetables.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.640
I mean, if it was a bigger tray, we would have eaten it.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.560
I mean, I tried one of those orange ones

49:19.560 --> 49:21.560
and I didn't care for it one bit.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.840
Oh, the crunchy boys?

49:22.840 --> 49:24.680
Yeah, the crunchy orange ones are no good.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.600
I got sinus surgery last year

49:26.600 --> 49:30.760
and while I was going home from the hospital,

49:30.760 --> 49:32.760
they had given me a little drink,

49:32.760 --> 49:34.600
a little nutritional drink of Boost

49:35.240 --> 49:37.240
and I drank one of those and I was like,

49:37.240 --> 49:39.000
I feel incredible.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.800
But I think it might be because I was still high

49:41.800 --> 49:43.400
a little bit from the surgery,

49:43.400 --> 49:45.240
but that Boost made me feel so good.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.400
So I bought like a 12 pack of Boost

49:47.400 --> 49:50.520
and it didn't, it wasn't that good.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.320
You know what I like?

49:51.320 --> 49:55.080
What I enjoy, which gives me my own Boost TM

49:55.800 --> 50:01.000
is I enjoy a strawberry and walnut salad.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.640
It always hits the spot

50:03.640 --> 50:06.760
and I find it crisp and refreshing and filling

50:06.760 --> 50:10.040
and gives me the energy I need to get out there.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.720
You are so not the beast right now.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.560
This is the not.

50:13.560 --> 50:16.840
But my beast allows me to finish doing the dishes

50:16.840 --> 50:18.200
and maybe stretch a little bit.

50:19.400 --> 50:21.560
You know what, I'll tell you what does me right,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.880
what makes me feel like I'm getting it done

50:23.880 --> 50:25.560
and brings out the beast within.

50:26.200 --> 50:29.000
Sometimes if I have a really healthy cereal in the house,

50:29.720 --> 50:31.560
I'll pour a really small bowl

50:31.560 --> 50:32.920
like they do in commercials

50:33.960 --> 50:37.240
and I'll kind of like put my leg up on a thick,

50:37.240 --> 50:40.360
sort of prop my leg up on a nearby banister

50:40.360 --> 50:42.680
like they do in commercials or a big rock

50:42.680 --> 50:44.760
and just kind of eat it with my puffy vest

50:44.760 --> 50:47.080
and a self-satisfied look on my face.

50:47.080 --> 50:49.800
And I really, I like to live in that moment a little bit,

50:49.800 --> 50:53.960
this world where I'm just having a small bowl of healthy cereal

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
and I'm about to use this energy to hike.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.280
I mean, a big bowl of Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti

51:02.280 --> 51:08.360
will get there for me most days.

51:08.360 --> 51:11.800
Most days, if I have like a big event coming up

51:11.800 --> 51:13.160
or I'm about to go on book tour

51:13.160 --> 51:17.080
or I'm about to have like a Comic Con Fred Savage encounter,

51:17.080 --> 51:17.880
I will just like,

51:17.880 --> 51:20.600
I have a little can of Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti with me

51:20.600 --> 51:24.520
and I will just, I'll cram it and be ready for the day.

51:24.520 --> 51:27.560
I just assume, I assumed that was a given.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.800
Like I would have said Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti

51:29.800 --> 51:33.000
if I had known like that wasn't just assumed.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.520
Like, yeah, yeah.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.600
Well, yeah, I edited out the part

51:36.600 --> 51:38.040
where I at the beginning of the question,

51:38.040 --> 51:40.600
I said, we're all gonna say Mama Freddie's turbo spaghetti.

51:40.600 --> 51:43.240
So let's just pass over that.

51:43.240 --> 51:49.960
Is there, this is slightly changing the question.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.840
So the inverse.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.840
Well, there's Mama Freddie's come down spaghetti.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.240
That's the only thing that can undo the turbo energy

51:55.240 --> 51:56.360
or else you'll die.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.960
And then there's Papa Cannoli's turbo ravioli,

51:59.960 --> 52:02.200
which is basically the same thing.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.600
This is kind of the inverse,

52:04.600 --> 52:08.280
but like, do you guys at this point in your lives

52:08.280 --> 52:13.080
know of food, perhaps specific restaurants

52:13.080 --> 52:18.600
that you know 100% if you eat at them, you will be sick?

52:18.600 --> 52:21.400
And not like a, if I overindulge,

52:21.400 --> 52:24.680
but like 100% if I darken the door there,

52:24.680 --> 52:25.800
I'm going home sick.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.320
Do you have places like that?

52:27.320 --> 52:28.520
Places or meals?

52:29.240 --> 52:30.200
Fazzolis.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.120
Fazzolis, yeah, it's not great for you.

52:32.120 --> 52:32.920
Yes.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.200
And Long John Silver's.

52:34.840 --> 52:37.240
If you're gonna go in there, you're gonna leave back.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.520
I thought you said restaurants.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.840
That's fair, that's a fair burn.

52:43.480 --> 52:45.960
On the Long John Silver's brand.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.640
But that's the thing is, I will say,

52:47.640 --> 52:51.560
I love quick service food, love it.

52:51.560 --> 52:52.760
I can't remember the last time.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.960
No one who loves it calls it that.

52:53.960 --> 52:54.440
What?

52:54.440 --> 52:55.480
Fucking nobody.

52:55.480 --> 52:58.760
That's the ultimate fake test.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.360
But I can't remember the last time I ate

53:00.360 --> 53:02.840
a fast food hamburger and walked away like, yes.

53:03.640 --> 53:04.840
Now I'm ready.

53:04.840 --> 53:07.160
I really wish I could help make jokes with you guys,

53:07.160 --> 53:09.080
but all I can do is sit here

53:09.080 --> 53:11.960
and try and think of other members

53:11.960 --> 53:14.760
of the canned pasta family.

53:15.320 --> 53:18.440
The best I've got is Grandma Tanya's power lasagna.

53:19.720 --> 53:21.720
It's not bad, it's pretty good.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.440
It's not bad.

53:24.440 --> 53:26.440
It's so full of protein,

53:26.440 --> 53:30.360
but not in the places you would expect this power lasagna.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.800
So do we leave, for the format of the joke,

53:33.800 --> 53:35.800
do we leave turbo, turbo?

53:35.800 --> 53:37.640
No, this is power lasagna.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.000
The turbo, this is a different,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.120
this one's more about gains.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.440
Oh, I see, okay.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.960
Turbo lasagna is speed.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.200
This one's about gains.

53:48.200 --> 53:50.680
There's probably a smart one.

53:50.680 --> 53:55.800
Yeah, like maybe like Cousin Joni's meditative rigatoni.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.040
Yeah, okay.

53:58.040 --> 53:59.560
That one's about inner peace and mindfulness.

53:59.560 --> 54:00.920
That one's about focus.

54:00.920 --> 54:12.520
Here's one, Cousin Jim's good sauce.

54:12.520 --> 54:14.360
Ah, so close.

54:15.800 --> 54:16.760
Almost nailed it.

54:19.240 --> 54:22.680
And then for adults who need a little bit of help

54:23.720 --> 54:24.680
revving their engine,

54:24.680 --> 54:30.760
we got Papa Pocky's horny gnocchi.

54:30.760 --> 54:33.640
They're little, and it comes in a discreet can.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.840
Delivered to your door in a brown paper package.

54:36.840 --> 54:40.360
It does not say, it says not Papa Pocky's horny gnocchi.

54:43.880 --> 54:50.440
Mr. Jim's nice food.

54:51.480 --> 54:54.120
It's good, Justin, you're getting us better than that.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.480
It gets better than the last one.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.880
You're moving in the right direction.

54:57.880 --> 54:59.720
Thank you, that's very kind, thank you.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.920
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week

55:02.920 --> 55:04.360
on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

55:04.360 --> 55:05.880
a show that we make just for you.

55:07.160 --> 55:08.760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

55:08.760 --> 55:10.840
Sorry that things have been a little bit scattershot

55:10.840 --> 55:14.520
over these past couple weeks and the two weeks to come.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.000
It's kind of like wild, wild time

55:17.000 --> 55:18.840
with like the book and book touring,

55:18.840 --> 55:21.080
Comic-Con and vacation and everything.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.440
Speaking of which, thanks for hanging in there with us.

55:22.440 --> 55:24.520
Speaking of which, next episode will almost certainly

55:24.520 --> 55:26.360
be a live show, we have not talked about this,

55:26.360 --> 55:30.440
but yeah, there is a, some of the McRoy's

55:30.440 --> 55:33.160
are going on vacation after the book tour

55:33.160 --> 55:35.240
and all the touring and stuff, and so I doubt

55:35.240 --> 55:36.920
that we will have time to record an episode,

55:36.920 --> 55:40.280
so yeah, I assume next one will be a live show.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.880
But it'll be a funny one.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.200
Yeah, you'll like it.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.520
Or you won't, you know, like it's a free world.

55:48.520 --> 55:53.320
Yes, so thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:53.320 --> 55:55.400
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

55:55.400 --> 55:57.240
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

55:57.240 --> 56:00.920
which is really good, and thanks to Maximum Fun

56:00.920 --> 56:02.200
for having us on the network.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.440
Shit, we have the biggest announcement.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.560
Oh shit.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.400
Bean Juice is dead.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.680
Oh God.

56:08.680 --> 56:11.800
Okay, yeah, not dead.

56:11.800 --> 56:13.000
Well, but it's a new-

56:13.000 --> 56:15.480
Bean Juice, as you know it, is dead.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.080
We talk, we fucking talked about it.

56:17.080 --> 56:18.440
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

56:18.440 --> 56:22.040
We're not spinning it, like a fucking debacle.

56:22.040 --> 56:26.040
It is a new era and a fresh face

56:26.040 --> 56:30.280
that all our loyal bean heads are gonna go wild for,

56:30.280 --> 56:32.440
and it's a benefit for their lifestyle,

56:32.440 --> 56:34.200
and it's gonna be more relatable to them

56:34.200 --> 56:35.720
and their friends and their families.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.440
It is not, we did not take a bath on this.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.120
We are making so much money that we wanna cash in, okay?

56:42.120 --> 56:44.280
Start over, start over, start over.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.880
Have we got an offer for you?

56:45.880 --> 56:47.480
You're gonna be so excited about it.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.880
Finally, a mug that keeps up with it.

56:49.880 --> 56:51.880
Listen, you loved Bean Juice,

56:51.880 --> 56:53.800
but you couldn't take Bean Juice on the go

56:53.800 --> 56:55.000
because that Bean Juice mug

56:55.000 --> 56:57.320
just wouldn't keep up with your lifestyle.

56:57.320 --> 57:00.280
But now, with Bean Juice 2.0,

57:00.280 --> 57:03.480
the new, latest, and greatest version of Bean Juice,

57:03.480 --> 57:05.640
you could take Bean Juice with you wherever you go.

57:05.640 --> 57:08.920
This is a portable mug, not like our first mug,

57:08.920 --> 57:11.400
which you felt weird taking with you on the go.

57:11.400 --> 57:14.280
This one, you're like, what if I did this?

57:14.280 --> 57:16.200
It's just functionally, it's the same mug.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.800
Can I take a swing, let me take a swing at it.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.160
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

57:19.160 --> 57:21.800
You're still drinking a Bean Juice 1.0 mug?

57:21.800 --> 57:23.720
Okay, grandpa or grandma.

57:24.760 --> 57:25.880
Don't think so.

57:25.880 --> 57:27.320
This one, this is you.

57:27.320 --> 57:30.360
Ah, time to sit down with my Bean Juice mug

57:30.360 --> 57:32.360
and pour some of the brown stuff in it.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.280
And you lift it up with your old arm.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.280
Gonna put it to my mouth.

57:36.280 --> 57:38.200
Hey, what's this cup say?

57:38.920 --> 57:42.440
Bee-een Juice?

57:42.440 --> 57:44.360
And while you've read that, while it takes you

57:44.360 --> 57:47.400
the time to read that, I did a stunt over a vape shop

57:48.040 --> 57:49.320
and got one already.

57:49.320 --> 57:51.960
And when I landed, I was holding the 2.0 mug,

57:51.960 --> 57:53.720
which you can read much faster.

57:53.720 --> 57:57.640
And the 2.0 company, it's a rebirth for Bean Juice.

57:57.640 --> 57:59.560
It's still pronounced the same way,

58:00.520 --> 58:04.840
but the company is now spelled B-N-J-C.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.680
It's so fresh now.

58:06.680 --> 58:09.880
I know you were saying that our stock ticker symbol

58:09.880 --> 58:13.160
is B-E-A-N, and so that's gonna be very confusing

58:13.160 --> 58:17.880
for the investors, but they don't know that vowels ain't it.

58:17.880 --> 58:18.680
No.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.600
We don't care about the investors.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.120
It's never been about the money.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.120
It's about profits.

58:24.120 --> 58:24.520
Yes.

58:24.520 --> 58:27.240
That's the only thing that is different from what they

58:27.240 --> 58:30.680
don't seem to understand on Wall Street when they're like,

58:30.680 --> 58:33.160
we're foreclosing, et cetera, et cetera.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.360
Unpaid bills, blah, blah, blah.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.080
If we don't traffic in money, we traffic in lifestyle.

58:39.080 --> 58:39.800
And profits.

58:39.800 --> 58:40.520
Profits.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.760
And profits that were supposed to be,

58:43.800 --> 58:48.760
according to DFTBA, fucking bulletproof, my man, on mugs.

58:50.280 --> 58:53.320
The margins on these things were supposed to be outrageous.

58:53.320 --> 58:55.080
People use mugs, they said.

58:56.120 --> 58:59.320
That's why Hank and John blowed a bunch of smoke in our face

58:59.320 --> 59:00.520
at the same time and said,

59:00.520 --> 59:02.520
these mugs are gonna make you guys fucking rich.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.640
And when they blew the smoke, it formed the word mugs,

59:05.640 --> 59:08.520
and then they turned the S into a dollar sign

59:08.520 --> 59:10.840
by like, it was so cool.

59:10.840 --> 59:11.560
It was cool.

59:12.120 --> 59:13.000
It was so cool.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.160
And we gave them our life savings to make those mugs,

59:15.160 --> 59:18.920
and now they're in Tahiti, and we're left with the, no.

59:19.880 --> 59:20.920
Bean juice 2.0.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.640
It's the new cool for the cool kids.

59:24.680 --> 59:26.280
Wait till you see this new design.

59:27.080 --> 59:27.960
You're gonna shit.

59:29.560 --> 59:30.200
Anything else?

59:30.200 --> 59:31.160
Can we wrap it on up?

59:31.160 --> 59:33.400
There's a whole bunch of new stuff coming to the merch store, too.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.000
You can go to mackerelmerch.com.

59:35.000 --> 59:35.800
None of it matters.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.320
I'm going to be at Gen Con.

59:37.320 --> 59:38.680
You can check out my Twitter.

59:38.680 --> 59:40.760
The banner at the top of my Twitter has all the dates.

59:40.760 --> 59:41.560
Dad's gonna be there soon.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.360
We're ruined!

59:42.360 --> 59:44.200
You can go to TravisMackerelRite.com,

59:44.200 --> 59:45.480
and it's gonna be there as well.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.480
And I will see you at Gen Con.

59:48.520 --> 59:50.120
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by,

59:50.120 --> 59:51.480
oh geez, the hat trick.

59:51.480 --> 59:52.680
Graham Roebuck, well done.

59:53.960 --> 59:54.680
Thank you, Graham.

59:54.680 --> 59:55.480
It's anonymous.

59:55.480 --> 59:59.640
No, it's Yahoo Answers user, BearThePolarBear, who asks,

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.200
why is Peter Gabriel's voice nice?

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.720
My name is Justin Mackerel.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.120
Travis Mackerel, you caught me drinking on that one.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.720
I was taking a sip on that one.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.680
Coach Billy's football fusilli.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.640
Is that anything?

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.080
It's close.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.280
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:34.840
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.960
Maximumfun.org.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.000
Comedy and culture.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.120
Artist owned.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.160
Listener supported.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.960
Hey, James.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.760
Hey, Nneke.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.640
What we doing, girl?

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.800
We are inviting the awesome listeners of Maximum Fun

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.320
to join us at Minority Corner.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.440
Ooh, fun.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.000
But you know how we go on Tangent City.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.120
We're the joint mayors.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.320
We're not gonna do that, okay?

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.280
Soup's focused.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.840
Okay, so Minority Corner is where you can all come

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.360
and get your pop culture takes.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.400
Plus social commentary, news, and TV movie reactions

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.680
like Avengers Endgame.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.800
No spoilers here.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.680
Ooh, snap.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.120
Sometimes we dig into the vaults

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.520
and we review and recap those movies you missed.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.120
Good at you, Halle Berry's Kidnapped.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.200
I love how she always gives 1000%.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.000
Like Beyonce.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.520
Did you see Homecoming on Netflix?

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.440
She was burning it down like the Mother of Dragons.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.880
Have you seen the latest Game of Thrones?

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.440
So good.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.560
Only thing missing?

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.080
More black people.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.280
What you think about Mayor Pete?

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.240
Wait a minute, James.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.200
We went on a tangent?

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:26.760
Yes.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.400
Ah well.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.720
Join us every Friday for more tangents.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:45.480
On Maximum Fun.
