00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown away with me.

00:25.000 --> 00:42.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown away with me. If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown away with me.

00:56.000 --> 01:10.000
I want to get an octopus tattoo. Really, really bad. I have for a while. Where's the sexiest place I could get an octopus tattoo on my body? Thanks guys. XsoHuxo.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I think that's hugs and kisses.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Okay, got it.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Thank you, Shawna.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Shawna.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Thank you for that.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Octopus tattoo.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I've been thinking about this since I saw the question. Is there a sexy place to get a tattoo?

01:23.000 --> 01:33.000
An octopus tattoo, yes. If you get it on your throbbing, glistening ink sac.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
If you have an ink sac.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
If you have an ink sac, get it right on there. Or maybe upon one of your tendrils. Other than that.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
I actually know somebody who has an octopus tattoo. And she has it on her ribs. It's very tasteful. I would say sexy.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Really?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Okay, ribs.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Like right on the ribs.

01:54.000 --> 02:05.000
Adam from Gmail writes in, my girlfriend sleeps a lot. She even fell asleep last night during Iron Man 2 when he was smashing atoms.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I haven't seen Iron Man 2. Does that happen?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yes.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Should she see a doctor?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, kind of.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Should she see a doctor? No. She should get down with naps.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:25.000
I would say naps are a good course of action. I wouldn't blame her for falling asleep during some parts of Iron Man 2. Namely the parts where Iron Man wasn't Iron Man-ing.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
This Iron Man-ing around is scarlet and gold.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
To be fair, one of us in this podcast fell asleep during Jurassic Park. So it's easy to fall asleep in a movie.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
I fell asleep during Lord of the Rings. It's possible to fall asleep in a movie, and I do not judge her at all.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
But that movie was five hours long. If you saw it in theaters, odds were that it was going to run past your bedtime.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
That is true.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Does that make sense?

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
If you see it after 4 p.m., then you're bound to just hit the hay in the midst.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
That makes sense.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
But I understand. That's a bummer when your significant other just sleeps like a koala bear. Because you want to hang out with her.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
She takes those short, sweet koala naps.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
And you have to find clever ways of waking her up without her getting mad at you. Like setting off the smoke alarm.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Or doing the laundry too loud.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Doing the laundry too loud. Or just singing...

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
What's that song? I would always just get in the shower. It's called Sister Christian, guys. Come on.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Get in the shower and just sing Motorhead.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
Motorhead! Lambie! Iron Maiden!

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
Yahoo Answers user Julie A. asks, where can I find a free dog?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Everywhere!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Everywhere!

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
There are wild dogs all over the place.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Every dog is free if you're quick enough.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
There's no additional information, but I don't think she's looking for a pound puppy.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't think she's interested in the immunization fees and stuff.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
I just think she wants a dog on the free. She wants a complimentary puppy.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Which is great, because she sounds like she's going to be a really responsible owner.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
Have you tried some of the finest hotels? Because often they'll have a complimentary puppy.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
An interim puppy that you can keep for a surcharge.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I heard that if you take the puppy with you, they just bill that straight to your bill.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Right off the credit card. That's why you have to give a credit card these days.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
For puppy fees.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
But only Visa. Mastercard doesn't have the puppy offer.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
That's what I heard.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Jake from Kentucky emailed us.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Does he ask? He does.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Hi guys, so I have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I really like this girl a lot, but sadly she's crazy about my best friend.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
He doesn't like her back. He likes her best friend.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
So I really want to ask this girl out, but I know she doesn't like me.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
She likes my best friend. So should I ask her out now?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Or wait it out and hope she gets over my friend?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Thanks for the help. Jake from Kentucky.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Did that make sense to you?

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
I have a suggestion, Jake. Why don't you get the transfer the fuck out of Sweet Valley High?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I was trying to make that Sweet Valley High joke.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Were you?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I couldn't come up with the wording.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
If she's all that, and any number of Freddie Prinze Jr. movies have taught me anything,

05:30.000 --> 05:39.000
you have to start fake dating her best friend so that she gets jealous, as does your best friend.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Then either everything will come out in the wash, or you'll fall in love with her best friend.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
I think that's how it happens. The best friend falling in love, and also Melissa Joan Hart is there.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Can someone walk me through this timeline again? I don't feel like I'm groping.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
This is up. Imagine four people. Imagine a square, only this square is not a straight square.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
It's crisscrossed in the middle. Does that make sense?

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
He's in love with her, but she loves him, even though he's in love with her, and she is a rump.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
This is from Jay Guile's band. This is that classic song Love Stinks.

06:18.000 --> 06:29.000
Yes. Make the best friend lose her glasses, maybe get a haircut, and a sexy now cut, a hip cut.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Jake, let me boil your question down for you.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
What you're asking is, should I ask out a girl that doesn't like me?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
No. I'm just going to go ahead and say no.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Find someone else, Jake.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Go with the robot.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
Go with the robot. Or, you know what? Go gay until everyone's so confused, and get really into your best friend.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Then once everyone's sufficiently confused, pull the old switcheroo.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Invite a couple more players into this little dance.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
This is going to be more confusing. Morgan Jacobson writes from Gmail.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Friend of the show.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Friend of the show, Morgan Jacobson.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
It says, I'm a 17-year-old guy who really likes this girl. Good start.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
She agreed to go out on a date with me, but I don't think she is at all that interested in me.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
What is a good way to make a really good impression on our first date?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Morgan, a fine question.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
I don't know that she's not interested in it. I think you might just be a little too shy.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You haven't let your freak flag fly.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Just like Griffin said.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Just like I said. Maybe not your freak flag, but you know what I'm saying.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I think it's that she doesn't know you.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
I think you've just got to be a proper gentleman. I think that's the best way to make a good impression.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
If I've learned anything from my wonderful brother, Justin McElroy, and my wonderful sister-in-law,

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
it is to ask her questions, be interested in her, don't talk about yourself, be interested in what she has to say.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
It took me a long time to learn that, because I love me.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
But she wants to talk about herself as much as you want to talk about yourself.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
So ask her questions about her.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
This is a great, great point.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Also, I think you've got to go naked day one.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Just saying.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
That's how you get her interested in you, by being interested.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You spring the trap!

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
Take her out to a nice dinner, and you sit down at Applebee's, and you're sitting down, and you order your drinks,

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
and then you take a bowie knife out of a sheath that you have attached to your belt that you had hidden underneath your polo,

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
and you just pull it out, and you sit it down on the table, and don't address it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Right? That's kind of mysterious.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I love it.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Or halfway through the date, like you're at a movie, and she's sitting on your right,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
you put an eye patch on your left eye, very discreetly, and just make sure she doesn't notice.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Do you see what I'm going for?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
No.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Do you see what I'm working up to?

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
You could stage some kind of epic fight with like a dragon or something.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I think that works.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, dragons aren't real, but you could pay a person to pretend to mug you, and then you fight them.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Oh, I like that.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
That's got a little something to it.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
There are all kinds. You've got to get creative.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So, Morgan, our real advice is hidden somewhere in there.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Have a great afternoon.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
All said, take her to Cold Stone.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah, go to Cold Stone.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
They put the shit in the shit.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, it's right in there.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Hold the shit with the shits.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Don't even worry about it.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Awesome.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
When is the best time to email you guys to ensure my life questions are answered?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Says William at Gmail.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I don't compile questions.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
What do you guys think?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
What's the best time?

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
The best time is any time before Wednesday morning.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
If you want them on the next week's show.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
But really, any time is good because I have no life, and I am constantly checking the email and the Twitter and the forms.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Don't make it adhere to our schedule.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
I think if you have an important life question, you've just got to fire it off as soon as it's in your mind, lest you forget it.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
And if it's urgent and you need us to answer right then, say that in the subject line.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Say it's urgent.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
We'll get you an answer, and then we'll talk about it on the show.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And I'm glad you brought this up, William.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
May I call you William?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
You may.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
We have been getting so many great questions on FormSpring and Gmail, and we really appreciate it, and it's great.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
But the most rapid response questions you're going to get is Twitter.

10:21.000 --> 10:30.000
If you want that, you know, at MBMBAM or hashtag MBMBAM is the best way to go for a question right now,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
especially because we're looking for more Twitter questions.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
So if you've got something you really want answered, hit it up, son.

10:38.000 --> 10:46.000
We've got Tweeter fever, which is a catchphrase I'm trying to get started and perhaps get a parody song written about.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
So just tweet right at us, and we'll tweet it back ASAP.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Quotably.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Yahoo Answers user J asks, can I give my pitbull Gatorade?

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, it's got the electrolytes that pitbulls crave.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Subquestion, can my pitbull drink Gatorade?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
So this is technically two different questions.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Can you give your pitbull Gatorade?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Yes.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Can my pitbull drink Gatorade?

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Gatorade has a certain drinkability to it, so I don't see why not.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm not sure you should give it, nor should your pitbull drink it, though.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Especially since Gatorade is expensive.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Why don't you just give your Gatorade water, Richy Rich?

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
Here's the thing, dogs don't sweat, so they don't have to replenish the electrolytes in salt like we do.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
That's why dogs walk around with their tongues hanging out, because they're getting their excess heat and moisture out that way.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
So no, because that's dumb.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
You're an idiot.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Don't give your dog Gatorade.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It turns their tongues red.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Gatorade, it's not called Gatorade anymore.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Obviously this guy didn't get the mem.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
What is it called?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
It's just called G now.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
It's just G?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, it's just G.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
What?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
You haven't seen that?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
No.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
It's just called G now.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Now it's just called G.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
G is the name of their product.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, to be fair.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
They took the whole Gatorade part and they completely subtracted it from the equation.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Now it's just plain old G.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
I hope that they do that with other drinks, because I would drink Pepsi if it was called P.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Just give me a big bottle of P.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm not touching that one.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
I want to share about this one.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Travis.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Speaking of P.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Speaking of P.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You rascal.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
So, Magic Incest.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Let's just talk about that for a while.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Moving on.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Magic Incest.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah, moving on.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
That's the username here via Gmail.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
It's a great question.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I think it's one.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
It might be divisive.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Has the potential to be divisive.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Peeing in the shower, yay or nay.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Honesty time.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Don't say anything.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
I think we all just need to go one, two, three, and then go.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So, one, two, three, and then you vote.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Okay.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
All right.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
One.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Two.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Two.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Three.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Three.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Yes.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Yay.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
No.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
You're a traitor.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
So, Travis said no.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Justin.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Hey.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Peeing in the shower.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
It's gross.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
It's notps in the world.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.920
I want to throw an addendum in there.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.880
The way our bathrooms set up, I can just open the curtain and the toilet's right there.

13:33.880 --> 13:38.020
So, I will do that from time to time, because the convenience factor is the same.

13:38.020 --> 13:39.020
You will?

13:39.020 --> 13:40.020
Yeah.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.380
That explains why our magazines are always soiled.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.380
They're awful.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.080
They're in the worst room.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.100
I'm sorry.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.560
I've ruined our reader's digests.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.820
So Justin, you're down with it?

13:51.820 --> 13:53.520
Why not?

13:53.520 --> 13:59.020
Cuz it's gross. It's not gross. It's basically like you're peeing on your feet. You're not peeing on your feet, okay

13:59.020 --> 14:03.900
I'm not saying like just start spinning around and urinating wildly on every

14:04.420 --> 14:08.340
Vertical surface in your shower. I'm saying fucking aim for the drain and pee

14:11.740 --> 14:17.900
That's a good motivational poster you're lying to yourselves because the two of you are living in sin and

14:17.900 --> 14:24.040
You are embarrassed to admit to each other that you might have stepped into one another's urine from time to time

14:24.040 --> 14:26.560
That's all I'm saying you're lying. I want to do

14:26.560 --> 14:32.200
I want to see a poster where a dad puts his hand on his son's shoulder and just says son aim for the drain

14:34.460 --> 14:40.640
We're not stepping in each other we don't take showers together. That's not our style. We're not done with magic incest

14:40.640 --> 14:43.580
We we take separate showers like grown adults

14:43.580 --> 14:49.680
Grown ass men. Grown ass men. I'm gonna say yay. I'll break the tie. Thank you. Thank you

14:49.680 --> 14:51.240
Yeah, I mean this is a drain right there

14:51.240 --> 14:56.680
It's practically a toilet you stand up in to get clean. The shower is a toilet you stand up in to get clean

14:57.360 --> 15:03.880
No matter what, no peeing in the sink. Don't poop in the shower though. That's awful. What do you think in magic incest?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.440
Why do you even do that?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.840
It takes a while

15:09.840 --> 15:15.800
And it's really great balance unless you have one of those like bars. Okay

15:19.520 --> 15:23.240
We're good on this. You know what I'm talking about. The balance bars. Yeah, we're done

15:25.120 --> 15:29.600
Tim asks via Gmail my brother recently proposed to his girlfriend and she said yes

15:29.600 --> 15:33.240
I am all but certain he's going to ask me to be his best man

15:33.240 --> 15:36.680
And while I'm happy to do so I'm kind of freaked out about the responsibilities

15:36.680 --> 15:41.400
I'll have any general advice you have on this matter would be appreciated also a quick run-through of what those

15:41.720 --> 15:43.720
Responsibilities actually are could be a big help

15:43.800 --> 15:48.300
Everybody knows about the bachelor party in the toast, but there has to be more to it than that Tim Gmail

15:49.120 --> 15:51.120
Tim I'm glad you asked

15:52.400 --> 15:58.440
I had a friend in college. He was a wise wise grad student named Steve Knight

15:59.120 --> 16:01.280
Steve Knight imparted to me this knowledge

16:01.280 --> 16:09.440
When you are a best man outside of the responsibilities like the toast in the bachelor party you have but two

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
responsibilities the one

16:12.280 --> 16:17.760
Is to give your friend the opportunity to be with a lady the night before do not encourage

16:17.760 --> 16:22.040
No happen the opportunity. I'm just quoting Steve Knight here and

16:23.040 --> 16:28.780
I wholeheartedly disagree with this and duty number two is the day of the wedding

16:28.780 --> 16:35.500
Look at your your brother or friend or what a what have you and say listen man if you want to go

16:35.500 --> 16:38.860
I'll cover for you. Those are your two responsibilities

16:40.020 --> 16:42.260
As a best man you are

16:42.980 --> 16:45.460
Not only a facilitator of shenanigans

16:46.620 --> 16:48.620
vis-a-vis a bachelor party

16:49.740 --> 16:53.180
You are also the final test of

16:53.180 --> 17:01.060
Yes his faithfulness you are you are making sure that he is actually ready to do this

17:01.060 --> 17:03.060
I am totally down with that Travis

17:03.540 --> 17:09.140
I think that if more best men were like this the divorce rate in this country in this world would be 0%

17:09.580 --> 17:11.900
Justin don't get me wrong. I'm not saying encourage it

17:11.980 --> 17:18.860
I'm saying that you're a liar that you're living a lie because you did not offer me the opportunity to be with another lady

17:18.860 --> 17:24.740
But the night before I got married no, but we did sit around with a bunch of dudes in a tiny pool and drink beer

17:24.740 --> 17:27.060
So it's pretty much. You're right. That was awesome

17:29.340 --> 17:34.020
Except when Jason tried to pee on me. Yeah. Yeah, not okay. It's all fun and games

17:36.020 --> 17:41.300
Jason you went a little too far. I know we were in a big tub, and it you know things got kooky

17:42.980 --> 17:46.940
Not okay, not okay. What's so either?

17:46.940 --> 17:53.900
You are is to make sure that everything goes well period and either offer them a chance to be with a woman or

17:54.380 --> 17:59.180
in a urine filled baby pool with eight eight dudes

17:59.820 --> 18:02.700
either one of those two and a keg in the middle I

18:03.860 --> 18:05.660
like it

18:05.660 --> 18:10.580
Form spring we're getting some really good accidental transitions form spring asks look

18:10.580 --> 18:15.900
I am gay, and I really like this guy I work with but I just don't know how to get his attention

18:15.900 --> 18:20.740
I've tried wearing provocative shirts and hats, but he just doesn't seem to care

18:20.900 --> 18:24.540
What should I do got it you got to get more provocative with those hats?

18:24.540 --> 18:28.380
I think I think their hats are provocative enough a lot of times. I'll see a hat. I'll be like oh

18:29.340 --> 18:31.340
Interesting, but maybe not provocative

18:32.700 --> 18:35.900
So like a safari hat and then there's a story there, right?

18:36.540 --> 18:38.540
Or show on homes have

18:38.980 --> 18:43.300
Yeah, are you searching for something is it Halloween is that a costume no?

18:43.300 --> 18:46.940
I'm solving mysteries. I like I like you. I

18:47.660 --> 18:53.420
Like you a lot you down the mystery is why aren't we together? Let's solve it. Let's solve it together you and me

18:54.340 --> 18:58.420
Elementary my dear Watson because we haven't gone on a date yet. Oh, I like that

18:59.020 --> 19:02.220
Is that a clue in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?

19:04.260 --> 19:06.660
Is that the game clue in your pocket I

19:07.940 --> 19:09.940
Don't know I mean

19:09.940 --> 19:14.940
This isn't my I love ladies this so this isn't exactly my area of expertise

19:14.940 --> 19:19.140
Maybe you find out if he's gay first. Yeah, that seems like step one

19:20.300 --> 19:26.700
When I'm courting a woman I try to make sure that she's down with dudes pretty pretty early in the courting process. Yeah

19:28.140 --> 19:32.780
But if otherwise just more better hats more better hats if he is

19:33.540 --> 19:36.900
If he is gay, then I would say that the same rules apply

19:36.900 --> 19:41.300
You're trying to be more get his attention more

19:42.020 --> 19:43.500
interesting to him

19:43.500 --> 19:46.540
Talk to him dude the same thing applies. Yeah

19:47.020 --> 19:53.540
How are his hats how provocative are his shirts? Hey? Hey Steve? That's a nice provocative. How you have to death

19:54.420 --> 19:57.020
I'm a chapeau is that a chapeau

19:57.820 --> 19:59.740
Is that a very late?

19:59.740 --> 20:07.780
It is very crisp did anybody did anybody watch army wives last night something like that would be a good sort of acid test

20:07.780 --> 20:09.360
I think

20:09.360 --> 20:14.620
Stephen that is a handsome beret handsome beret Stephen. How about army wives last night?

20:14.620 --> 20:21.700
Is that a raspberry beret Prince you like Prince? I do too. How about those ruffled shirts women?

20:21.700 --> 20:30.060
Are you saying let's go to this club in the city. Yeah, I know of a club where all the hats are provocative and all the shirts I

20:31.100 --> 20:34.900
Enjoy it you will enjoy it too Steve. I suspect you will enjoy it Steve

20:34.900 --> 20:41.860
I suspect you will enjoy me at if not wait for tomorrow when my hat will be far more provocative than it is at the moment

20:42.220 --> 20:44.620
form spring another one from form spring a

20:45.580 --> 20:50.260
Couple of my long-standing friends have recently decided to be douche bags

20:50.260 --> 20:57.580
They've become increasingly hostile passing off as a joke, but rarely letting up when together

20:58.300 --> 21:03.340
Apart they're still great guys, but I can't stand together. Oh, man. What to do

21:05.820 --> 21:09.060
I don't know what to tell you. I don't I don't think

21:10.380 --> 21:16.140
No, that's not true. I can pick out and some of my friends turn into douche bags. I can think of a few friends

21:16.140 --> 21:18.300
I'm not gonna name them Jacob dunkel

21:18.300 --> 21:19.740
Oh

21:19.740 --> 21:21.740
No, I'm kidding

21:21.980 --> 21:26.580
I love you Jacob dunkel. I I think you just got to move on. I don't think

21:27.260 --> 21:30.680
If your friends are douche bags, like if they're being social chameleons or whatever

21:30.680 --> 21:35.300
Like they've they've found new friends and and have changed you just gotta that's hard

21:35.300 --> 21:37.660
I I assume you know what this sounds

21:37.660 --> 21:40.140
I don't know if you're in in college or high school

21:40.140 --> 21:46.200
But it sounds high school because that happens a lot in high school like it's a very fickle sort of situation

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
You know people ebb and flow

21:48.980 --> 21:52.380
Most guys got us you just got to stick it out if you're in high school

21:52.500 --> 21:55.740
Because those are your the only friends like you've already invested so much time

21:55.740 --> 21:59.300
You might as well just roll with the changes and like oh you guys love evanescence

21:59.300 --> 22:03.300
I do too now because I have to be you to be with you most of the time in a group

22:03.300 --> 22:09.560
There's a de facto not necessarily a leader, but someone who does something and then they start that trend

22:09.560 --> 22:15.480
If you know who that person in your group is talk to them apart and be like listen

22:15.480 --> 22:17.440
You might not realize it because you're in the middle of it

22:17.440 --> 22:23.080
But you guys are douche bags and you need to cut that shit out and I think in this point

22:23.880 --> 22:29.920
Confrontation or walk away are your options or both? Yeah, or or

22:31.400 --> 22:36.920
Unless what unless what if you were to pull the Lord of the Flies

22:36.920 --> 22:43.780
The leader kill the leader kill the leader with a big rock kill the leader of the big rock take the conch shell

22:44.280 --> 22:46.280
How's your conch shell?

22:48.320 --> 22:50.320
Kill him kill someone day one

22:50.960 --> 22:53.520
Day one kill the leader get his glasses

22:54.160 --> 22:57.920
Take it to the limit. Don't do it at school though because you know the principles

22:57.920 --> 23:02.500
There's a zero tolerance policy on Lord of the Flies takeovers. You will get on the news though

23:02.500 --> 23:07.300
Yeah, we rarely and by rarely I mean never

23:08.660 --> 23:15.860
Crossover into the realm of politics. We like to put all of our we have one big umbrella for all of our listeners

23:15.860 --> 23:18.860
It's a safe zone a spin-free zone if you will

23:19.620 --> 23:25.700
But there's a yahoo questions user named stir it up. Oh five that has

23:26.380 --> 23:28.380
importance political query

23:28.900 --> 23:31.300
That I think we could answer in a fair and balanced way

23:31.300 --> 23:33.060
will

23:33.060 --> 23:35.700
There be a presidential election in 2012

23:39.620 --> 23:46.080
Now the the additional information is a bit lengthy so stay stay with me recently the buzz about not having elections in 2012 has gained a

23:46.080 --> 23:53.280
Lot of momentum it seems to stem from several of Obama's initiatives and other legislation being introduced that gives Obama some frightening powers

23:53.280 --> 24:03.520
For example cyber legislation gives Obama sole power to shut down the internet presidential term limits repeal of the 22nd amendment in the

24:03.520 --> 24:07.640
Controversial 16,000 armed IRS agents on radio and TV

24:07.640 --> 24:12.760
I have heard several comments about the possibility that we will not have presidential elections in 2012

24:12.880 --> 24:21.200
When guests to the various show mentioned the elections and possible turnovers in 2012 several hosts have remarked if we have elections in

24:21.200 --> 24:29.360
2012 well your thoughts what other events the legislation could give you concern about whether or not the 2012 elections will be canceled and if

24:29.360 --> 24:31.360
Tried what will the public reaction be?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.600
stir it out

24:33.600 --> 24:35.600
Wow

24:36.320 --> 24:38.320
Well

24:38.400 --> 24:40.160
a

24:40.160 --> 24:45.440
Fair and free democratic elections is the really the foundation of this country of ours

24:45.440 --> 24:51.280
But the experiment called him America now that Obama is a cyber God um

24:51.600 --> 24:58.400
He can pretty much take that out with a wave of his cyber hand so yeah, he's got digital legislation and sole power

24:58.400 --> 24:59.760
Yeah

24:59.760 --> 25:05.900
Combine that combine those two together, and it's like yikes. I don't know about if if if President Obama

25:07.240 --> 25:08.720
President Barack

25:08.720 --> 25:10.560
Hussein Obama

25:10.560 --> 25:13.680
Shuts down the internet can we keep doing our show oh?

25:13.680 --> 25:20.840
We can shout yeah, we'll just have to yell really loud, so we'll do like live stage versions. Yes, exclusively

25:21.880 --> 25:24.440
Justin let me ask you something your your wife is a doctor

25:24.440 --> 25:30.560
So I assume you have insight onto this one of my co-workers informed me that the recent health care legislation

25:31.560 --> 25:34.680
allows physicians to make the decision

25:35.160 --> 25:41.020
Whether to not parents important to note the physician whether to put to death

25:41.020 --> 25:45.660
Mentally handicapped children is that true or false?

25:46.580 --> 25:49.020
Here's here's my counter that where's the decision?

25:52.460 --> 25:54.460
Yeah, I

25:54.980 --> 26:01.340
Argued with this dude for a solid like 30 minutes going I can't believe that that's true. He was like no no I read it

26:01.340 --> 26:06.520
I've read it. I read it. I said so the doctor can look at the parents and be like listen straight up

26:06.540 --> 26:08.060
I know you didn't ask

26:08.060 --> 26:13.820
But I'm gonna have to do this I think more trouble than that is

26:14.300 --> 26:18.620
That Obama has the power to single-handedly shut down the internet

26:18.860 --> 26:24.280
He has a switch on the underside of the of the desk. He can't stand up too quick oops

26:24.280 --> 26:28.500
He can't where's my where's my gmail? What is gmail?

26:28.500 --> 26:33.380
There's that it's a non-existent entity gmail never happened Craigslist. Sorry out

26:33.380 --> 26:40.100
Yeah, shut it down Yahoo answers a font of constant comedy. It's gone now this question itself

26:41.180 --> 26:46.060
Whoa, so not only can he shut down the internet he erases the internet from time

26:48.300 --> 26:50.980
He also has that cyber power you mean sole power

26:51.700 --> 26:53.980
He has that sole power from the cyber legislation

26:54.820 --> 26:56.620
held in

26:56.620 --> 26:58.620
techno Congress

26:58.620 --> 27:06.060
There was a cyber bill in techno Congress that gave him the power to go back in time and stop events from happening

27:06.460 --> 27:12.980
Android of the house, can you pass the oil so I can the 22nd amendment hasn't been repealed. It's been

27:13.940 --> 27:16.100
D-written it's been D

27:16.620 --> 27:21.380
D. It's been unsought. I just say we have just written the greatest movie ever

27:22.180 --> 27:24.180
time travel president

27:24.180 --> 27:26.180
a

27:27.180 --> 27:30.720
Soul power every time I hear digital legislation, I think

27:32.900 --> 27:34.900
Minority report gloves on

27:41.460 --> 27:43.260
So

27:43.260 --> 27:47.660
To answer your question. Yes, of course. There'll be a goddamn election in 2012

27:47.660 --> 27:53.740
You but the only thing we're electing is a new president of the collapse society that we have because there's no more internet

27:53.740 --> 27:55.740
It's just like Wolfman and

27:58.420 --> 28:05.900
So, yeah, yeah, I recently failed my first semester of college well, let's try through the

28:07.740 --> 28:10.780
Course is in a field. I'm passionate about game design

28:10.780 --> 28:17.460
Should I retake the semester or is it a sign to try something else? I failed dude lack of attendance. That's my favorite part

28:17.460 --> 28:24.180
I mean, it's a sign to try going to class. Why don't you try? Why don't you try that method of?

28:24.940 --> 28:31.340
Success first try going I've got this study method that I do where I open a book and I sit down in the chair and I

28:37.940 --> 28:40.660
It's not that you're not proficient in your field

28:40.660 --> 28:47.380
It's that you're proficient at waking up and getting out of bed and putting pants on and leaving and going to a room

28:47.540 --> 28:54.780
Where learning takes place? It's a field. He's really passionate about but not passionate enough to walk away from that SpongeBob marathon. I

28:55.940 --> 29:01.140
Feel you though. I I had a really I did great in high school. I graduated high school

29:01.140 --> 29:02.780
It's like a like a 3.8

29:02.780 --> 29:03.620
Like I killed it

29:03.620 --> 29:10.140
I got a full ride to Marshall University and I got even like a little bonus scholarship because I was just so smart all the time

29:10.140 --> 29:16.100
And then I got to my first semester at Marshall and got like a 2.2

29:16.100 --> 29:21.180
Like I did so so bad because when you have that freedom you just go buck-ass wild

29:21.540 --> 29:26.620
That's totally to be expected. Like you should you stop going to class if it's when you start

29:27.460 --> 29:31.260
College, you know you you what distractions do you have in high school, right?

29:32.100 --> 29:33.580
MTV

29:33.580 --> 29:36.740
Riding in cars. That's pretty much whip whip. It's

29:36.740 --> 29:41.500
With this face face. Look, that's it when you get to college. It's like

29:42.420 --> 29:43.860
drinking

29:43.860 --> 29:45.860
fornication

29:46.220 --> 29:48.220
Rugged shrug us what

29:52.820 --> 29:58.260
There are drugs to take you're you're gonna start a really shitty full man

29:58.260 --> 30:04.940
I would say frisbee just hacky sack you and your buddies

30:05.020 --> 30:10.340
You're gonna start a shitty folk band called the hard and the easy you're gonna play out a few shows

30:11.620 --> 30:17.700
Gonna gonna get some good hits gonna get a couple songs that people can kind of sing along to their version of Bob Dylan's the

30:17.700 --> 30:19.700
man and me is

30:20.140 --> 30:25.200
Really bad. It's not good. It's actually not very good. No, they should do their own stuff from now on

30:25.200 --> 30:28.920
Hey, here's what you need to do go to class every Monday

30:29.060 --> 30:32.820
They always cover new shit on Monday and then just talk about it throughout the course of the week

30:32.820 --> 30:34.080
So just go on Monday

30:34.080 --> 30:38.720
So that's what I did and I graduated with like straight A's failed due to lack of attendance Travis

30:38.720 --> 30:43.360
What part of this problem are you not getting? I picture him not going to class at all

30:43.360 --> 30:47.760
Your solution cannot be we'll try going not going to class at different times. No

30:48.560 --> 30:50.560
class 20% of the time

30:50.560 --> 30:54.880
Yeah, you just try again. You'll do it. I believe if you like

30:55.440 --> 31:00.440
Game design is pretty fun. And you seem like I mean you're lazy. So you must like video games

31:00.800 --> 31:02.600
So I think you should just try it again

31:02.600 --> 31:07.320
And I think you'll I think if you get into trouble just email us and say like guys should I go to class urgent?

31:07.320 --> 31:12.960
Yeah, I should I go to class the scheduler classes later in the day take evening classes. Yeah, that's something

31:14.360 --> 31:19.960
Another an honest anonymous one from form spring says how do I politely tell my wife?

31:19.960 --> 31:23.940
That I don't want to watch any more fucking CSI

31:24.760 --> 31:26.600
Margaret

31:26.600 --> 31:28.800
The Margaret part wasn't on in there, but it was

31:29.560 --> 31:33.440
Listen, it's got to sit her down and let us talk to her

31:34.760 --> 31:36.760
Okay. Hey, listen

31:37.800 --> 31:39.800
Marge Marge, can we call you Marge?

31:41.120 --> 31:43.440
He doesn't want to watch CSI anymore

31:43.440 --> 31:49.040
There's lots of good shows. Have you guys tried? Um, oh

31:49.880 --> 31:54.520
No, don't you do that to me lie to me no what likes me is a great show

31:54.520 --> 31:59.160
I just started watching it today that you're you're talking about some out of the frying pan into the fire shit

31:59.160 --> 32:03.280
I think I think this writer has some more discerning taste. He doesn't want to watch CSI

32:03.280 --> 32:09.180
I don't think he wants to watch murder dramas. Yeah, right. Maybe he wants to try have you tried any other show?

32:09.180 --> 32:13.320
What about Buffy the Vampire Slayer? That's a good one West Wing go back all of that

32:13.320 --> 32:17.520
West Wing is the best show ever made all of Buffy is on Netflix instant queue, too

32:17.520 --> 32:21.720
So you can just watch that you can just watch that right now, but listen, he doesn't want it

32:21.720 --> 32:28.400
It's nothing against hit you. He loves you. He just have different tastes here. He's afraid of Laurence Fishburne

32:28.400 --> 32:31.640
Mm-hmm. It's the eyes see eyes. Is he on a CSI?

32:31.840 --> 32:35.460
What yeah, he is Travis's Travis is my Bam Bam's

32:36.120 --> 32:38.120
resident CSI expert

32:38.120 --> 32:44.800
Here's the thing. There are so many flavors of CSI in the world these days. Have you tried CSI of Miami yet?

32:44.800 --> 32:51.280
That's my note. Yeah, maybe he likes the the sexy bikinis the Sun the lack of sweat

32:52.240 --> 32:58.360
And someone removing their glasses in a dramatic way those criminals get creative too in that heat

32:59.280 --> 33:01.280
With those makes you clever

33:01.280 --> 33:08.080
He makes you clever. He makes you crazy or perhaps. He's more a fan of friend of the show Gary Sinise. I

33:08.960 --> 33:13.720
Would like to see a show like CSI Miami it would be Florida based only it would be

33:14.720 --> 33:16.720
CSI Vero Beach. Whoa

33:17.520 --> 33:25.160
All ever all of the CSI people are 85 years old and every murderers are 85 years old every case turns out to be natural

33:25.160 --> 33:27.160
causes

33:27.160 --> 33:32.400
It was natural causes. We don't see any weapon wounds or signs of entry at all

33:33.080 --> 33:37.160
It looks like he just fell down in the bathtub, and he hurt himself

33:37.160 --> 33:43.600
And he just kind of died there because he was old. I think if you are already watching the New York CSI

33:43.600 --> 33:52.040
You're probably sick of episodes about 9-eleven because now like eight years later nine years later still every episode is about 9-eleven

33:52.040 --> 33:55.960
And I know I said, I'd never forget

33:57.160 --> 33:59.160
Now you haven't and now you can't

33:59.640 --> 34:03.680
No, I can't cuz it's still on CSI. God damn it all right

34:04.400 --> 34:08.960
Stupid CSI so please don't make him watch it more CSI from Twitter

34:09.920 --> 34:11.920
Whoa wait great

34:12.400 --> 34:14.400
Greg Brady there first I get of

34:14.760 --> 34:20.160
All nude review rights from Twitter. I work from home now, and I'm having trouble concentrating

34:20.160 --> 34:22.160
Concentrating do I need to go on the drugs?

34:22.840 --> 34:25.400
That's not that doesn't seem like it's gonna help your problem

34:27.080 --> 34:33.400
Listen meth seems like you're gonna. I'm just I can't focus. I need to do a bump can do about just one bump

34:33.400 --> 34:35.240
That's all I need

34:35.240 --> 34:37.240
need a fix

34:37.520 --> 34:39.160
I

34:39.160 --> 34:42.960
It's it's hard. I I'm in your I'm in your boat. I work out of the home

34:43.840 --> 34:48.080
And it's hard because you got the whole internet there. You got all your cool stuff there

34:48.080 --> 34:50.080
You don't have anybody watching over your back

34:50.240 --> 34:52.240
I

34:52.440 --> 34:57.480
Get I so that's that's tough what I would say is try to make your

34:59.000 --> 35:03.520
Work environment a little more pleasing like demo ice a little bit play some soft music

35:04.440 --> 35:06.440
It's kind of reduce a drawback

35:07.520 --> 35:12.680
Have some checking yourself and scented oil oil up oil up on that I

35:12.680 --> 35:18.400
I don't know. That's the best advice. You're really you're asking the wrong people because right now Justin

35:18.400 --> 35:22.480
And I are supposed to be working yeah, so I don't know recorder podcast

35:23.440 --> 35:26.240
Recorder podcast or something on the real though what I've done

35:26.840 --> 35:34.560
Is I've separated all of my internet bookmarks into three folders one being essential work utilities

35:35.240 --> 35:41.880
One being non-essential work utilities and one being fun stuff. You know a link to my my penguin club

35:41.880 --> 35:47.400
And what have you and so after I write a few stories I will

35:48.240 --> 35:51.520
Open up my fun folder and have about ten minutes of me time

35:52.200 --> 35:54.960
exploring the the Arctic landscape of penguin world

35:55.560 --> 35:57.000
I

35:57.000 --> 36:00.040
Think that that's a good way to get your your shit straightened out

36:01.360 --> 36:03.360
Travis works at PetSmart

36:06.320 --> 36:09.680
So I want to hear I want to hear

36:09.680 --> 36:11.000

36:11.000 --> 36:14.760

36:15.440 --> 36:22.640
Obligated to tell you that you can get advice from us in a myriad ways through Twitter if you hit a

Yeah, or if you have questions about your CSI obsessed wife, but you don't want to call her out by name. Yeah, that's a good way to

38:42.880 --> 38:46.280
Last question of the day comes to us from Yahoo answers user Mara
