00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern

00:47.760 --> 00:51.840
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

00:51.840 --> 00:56.560
Patrick McElroy Esquire. And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary,

00:56.560 --> 01:03.040
Griffin, healthy boy, McElroy. Back on his grind. Back on, and I've been chomping down those

01:03.040 --> 01:10.160
vitamins, as my friends in New Zealand call them, vitamins, and such a fun little turn of phrase.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.320
And yeah, I'm empowered by the D and by the E and by the C, so feeling great.

01:14.960 --> 01:22.560
Such a proud moment today. I activated on Hulu an episode of Sailor Moon Crystal,

01:22.560 --> 01:29.200
the sort of revamp relaunch on Hulu. And I started the English version because my daughter

01:29.200 --> 01:34.960
speaks English. Primarily. I've been trying to teach her Icelandic, but she's-

01:34.960 --> 01:39.520
She also claims to speak baby whenever she hangs out with Henry and Charlie, so true.

01:39.520 --> 01:45.120
Yes, that's true. And she has picked up a good amount of Spanish from Dora. I started this

01:45.120 --> 01:49.600
episode of Sailor Moon and my daughter loudly announced, and I don't know where she picked

01:49.600 --> 01:55.280
this phrase up, I can only imagine, she loudly announced that she wanted subs, not dubs.

01:56.080 --> 02:04.240
Well, wouldn't- Yeah, that's a- I mean, she's a purist, and that's very good. You need to nurture

02:04.240 --> 02:12.400
that small flame into a raging bonfire of sort of righteousness about sort of anime, how they

02:12.400 --> 02:14.080
sort of get their info across.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.880
I like how you said you don't know where she got that from, as though it wasn't from Taylor.

02:18.880 --> 02:24.400
Yeah, or from- She doesn't- She's not on Tumblr, is she? God, I hope not.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.560
No, she's not on Tumblr. She's on Tumblr Junior.

02:27.200 --> 02:32.160
Yeah, she's on Toddler Tumblr. Whoa, toddlertumblr.com. Let me just see if I can get

02:32.160 --> 02:38.960
that one real quick. Here's a- So I'm very proud of my daughter, and she said that she

02:38.960 --> 02:42.400
wanted to watch it so she could learn Japanese, which I told her that that-

02:43.200 --> 02:44.720
That's exactly how it works, actually.

02:44.720 --> 02:49.520
So this concludes all- Everything we know.

02:50.240 --> 02:55.040
No, this concludes all the discussion we ever want to have about anime, so please-

02:55.040 --> 02:57.600
I mean, I can go hard if y'all want.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.560
Nah, you got Twitter up right now at home. You're ready to tweet a great bon mot about-

03:02.560 --> 03:10.000
Just maybe don't. I don't actually want to talk about anime anymore, so that's all the

03:10.000 --> 03:13.600
anime discussion that we're ever going to have, so this is not a continuing bit.

03:13.600 --> 03:19.120
I mean, I will continue to reference Yuri on Ice wherever and whenever it is even remotely

03:19.120 --> 03:21.760
appropriate, so look forward to that.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.560
Do the cool kids ever call that Yuri on the rocks?

03:25.680 --> 03:31.440
No, that's a different show where it's two, you know, rock climbers, but they're very

03:31.440 --> 03:34.880
much in love. Very, very deeply in love.

03:34.880 --> 03:43.200
Here's a new segment on the show. It's called Domain Renewals, and these are

03:43.200 --> 03:50.080
domains that I've now owned for over a year and are still operational.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.960
Just want to remind everybody, these are just from this month, the ones that-

03:56.240 --> 04:01.440
the domains that I own that are up for renewal, just to remind everybody about these great

04:01.440 --> 04:06.000
domains. Renewed this month, dadyelp.com.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.600
So a lot of our business seems to be like a type of age of person and then existing

04:13.600 --> 04:15.120
brand.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.320
Can we remember, was dadyelp a yelp for dads to use?

04:18.320 --> 04:19.360
For dads.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.200
Or was it like a yelp to great dads you've experienced?

04:24.880 --> 04:31.280
I think it was a yelp just for dads. I actually, thinking about it, I made

04:31.280 --> 04:35.840
teengoogle.com goes to Still Buffering, the podcast about the teenage experience,

04:35.840 --> 04:40.960
and I have been thinking about it. I think dadyelp should probably go to We

04:40.960 --> 04:44.880
Got This with Mark and Hal. That's basically like dadyelp, right?

04:44.880 --> 04:51.120
I do like, Justin, how your domains have become the Christian mingle of, I guess,

04:51.120 --> 04:55.840
weird comedy. It's just always something mingle.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.720
What I love is that I forget the jokes that we tell more or less as soon as we publish

05:00.720 --> 05:06.640
the episode that contains them, and yet you pay an annual fee to remember our half jokes.

05:06.640 --> 05:11.360
It's as though our dumb, dumb jokes cost you money to make.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.080
You are paying a premium for our dumb, dumb jokes.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.600
Yeah, just some other ones that have come up. Literally just this month, I guess in

05:17.600 --> 05:23.600
January, I go hard on domains. Just this month, illegal.horse is back up

05:23.600 --> 05:27.680
for renewal. Sexymugshots.com.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.240
That autofills every time I press S, and I have to remind myself that I'm not a deep

05:32.240 --> 05:37.360
web pervert. Sexymugshots.com is back up for renewal.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.400
That goes to our YouTube channel for some reason.

05:41.680 --> 05:47.120
Also, other domains that have just popped up, my youngest son's seventh word, hyphen,

05:47.120 --> 05:52.800
my youngest son's 15th word,.pizza, is back up for renewal.

05:52.800 --> 06:00.400
That deep cut from the MBMBAM ARG, TV show ARG, and I think those are all the domains

06:00.400 --> 06:03.360
that are up. Oh, BooBooNanny.com.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.320
Do not remember why BooBooNanny. So that's like $500 that you're paying

06:09.040 --> 06:13.200
to keep these balls in the air. I keep waiting for the offers to come in

06:13.200 --> 06:16.960
on these domains for someone to try to buy them out from underneath me.

06:16.960 --> 06:22.960
Do you claim those on your taxes as expenses, and are you worried about getting audited?

06:22.960 --> 06:27.120
I mean, they're legitimate. It's a legitimate business expense, I think.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.440
Which one vapes is broken now? Oh, no.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.360
I know. Got too hot.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.400
Got too hot. Whoever created which one vapes, please fix it.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.440
Should we answer some questions, you think? Oh, that sounds actually really nice.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.960
Griff, you're Griffin, yeah. That sounds nice.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.200
One of my friends recently got really into baking loaves of bread

06:45.200 --> 06:49.840
and likes to share them with me. Problem is, they all taste super bad.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.720
It's a bad bake, Barry. It's a bad bake.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.400
How can I be gracious in accepting his gifts without wasting a bunch of bread?

06:56.960 --> 06:59.760
I don't want to tell him the bread sucks because he's very proud of them,

06:59.760 --> 07:02.720
but what do I do? That says, thanks.

07:03.280 --> 07:09.440
Awkward in Philly is who that's from. Can you waste bad bread is the question.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.280
The bread's wasted. Yeah.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.480
The bread is wasted. Well, what has been wasted here is the flour,

07:14.480 --> 07:18.400
the yeast, the water and sugar. The time.

07:18.400 --> 07:25.840
The time, especially. The heat from the oven, that energy can't be created or destroyed,

07:25.840 --> 07:32.400
but it can be wasted firming up some bad bread. That energy is trapped in that bread,

07:32.400 --> 07:35.040
and if you don't free it, it's just trapped there forever.

07:35.040 --> 07:41.840
Well, you free it by giving it to a duck, who then turns it into dookie and duck flight.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.280
Duckie dookie, yes. So the ducks fly and makes all the wind,

07:45.280 --> 07:49.360
but sometimes the wind gets to be too bad and we get hurricanes, tornadoes.

07:49.360 --> 07:54.560
Dry it out, put it in the food processor, whiz it into bread crumbs,

07:54.560 --> 07:57.440
and then take a coffee can and cover it in peanut butter,

07:58.160 --> 08:02.800
and then put the bread crumbs all over that, and then hang the coffee can outside.

08:02.800 --> 08:08.720
You got yourself a nice little bird feeder. And then you wait for them to fall into your trap.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.160
Yeah. Yeah. I do like awkward

08:12.160 --> 08:17.600
and feel like that you have failed to see that there might be a middle road between accepting

08:17.600 --> 08:22.800
the bad bread and saying, this bread sucks. And that is not returning your friend's

08:22.800 --> 08:25.040
calls ever again. Well, no, but like,

08:25.040 --> 08:29.200
it's pretty well-established practice to say like, oh, this is great.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.280
And then give like a tiny note, like a tiny note.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.880
Oh, is that established? Is that something I can do with my day-to-day?

08:36.880 --> 08:42.880
Someone's just starting out when someone's just starting out on a new hobby experience,

08:42.880 --> 08:46.640
like to try to pretend like you nailed it 100% the first time.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.680
Nobody expects that. Now it might be too late now

08:49.680 --> 08:54.000
because you might have accepted too many. But this is more of a cautionary tale for the next

08:54.000 --> 08:58.080
loaf receiver to say like, oh, this is great. Maybe a little too much salt.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.480
Try less next time. Boom. Done.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.640
You've established like, because if somebody is trying out a new experience,

09:04.640 --> 09:07.200
they want feedback. They don't want you to be like,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.600
you're the greatest. That's right. I love you,

09:09.600 --> 09:13.840
but they wicked don't. Unless your friend has said,

09:13.840 --> 09:18.000
be sure to hit me with all of your great feedback after you finish consuming my gift,

09:18.560 --> 09:22.240
then they do not in fact want that. I bake from time to time,

09:22.240 --> 09:26.560
and I know I over-need my stuff sometimes. And all I want is for people to look at me

09:26.560 --> 09:31.040
like I'm the motherfucking barefoot Contessa. Like that's literally all that I need from

09:31.040 --> 09:36.640
that transaction. Also, it's like, I wish this person had been more specific

09:37.440 --> 09:45.040
with the problems in the bread because your friend, like, unless you're a bread expert,

09:45.840 --> 09:49.200
maybe you're not going to know that like, hey, you had too much leavening in here.

09:49.200 --> 09:56.320
Like, hey, you added a little bit too much milk and you made the batter too wet.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.560
You're not going to know that from eating the bread.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.080
You got to watch your friend bake the bread step by step. And then you'll see the process.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.640
Like you got to pour the yeast in, pour water. You want that water to be between 100 and 110

10:06.640 --> 10:09.840
degrees. Activate the yeast for about five minutes. Then you're going to add your dry

10:09.840 --> 10:14.240
ingredients. Incorporate those in a little bit of egg. And then I'm going to dump in a two liter

10:14.240 --> 10:19.120
Mountain Dew and then move it. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. I think I see the

10:19.120 --> 10:25.280
problem. Oh, the two pages stuck together in the book, you were making Mountain Dew cake.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.680
It's different. It's a different one. You weren't using Diet Mountain Dew. And that's where the

10:29.680 --> 10:36.320
flavor sleeps. Actually, if you want a fucking cake, you take cake mix, mix it with 12 ounces

10:36.320 --> 10:42.000
of soda and you got yourself a fucking cake going. That's a cake right there. Make a Mountain Dew

10:42.000 --> 10:45.360
with a little bit of lemon cake mix, Mountain Dew. Yeah, do you bake that or just, like,

10:45.360 --> 10:50.720
eat it with a spoon? While crying and also getting psyched up to play esports.

10:50.720 --> 10:58.160
Uh, how about a Yahoo Griffin? I would love to give that to you because here's one from

10:58.160 --> 11:01.840
Level 9000. Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport. Thank you, Drew. It's a Yahoo Answers user.

11:01.840 --> 11:09.680
Let's kick it after school. Who asks, should I punch Tyler in the face if he insists on calling

11:09.680 --> 11:16.320
eating refueling? He's annoying me. End of question. Now, no, you shouldn't punch your

11:16.320 --> 11:22.960
friend Tyler in the face. But I think if anybody in your life refers to the act of eating food,

11:22.960 --> 11:27.920
whether it's, you know, a big sloppy Joe or a rack of ribs or some weird bad Mountain Dew bread,

11:28.800 --> 11:35.520
and they call that refueling, they need to be punished in some way. Unless. This is going to

11:35.520 --> 11:42.320
be a tricky needle, but unless. They're a robot. A robot who eats. Is your friend Tyler a robot?

11:42.320 --> 11:47.920
Yeah. I mean, what? It's 2018. We're just going to toss out the fact that it might be a robot?

11:48.640 --> 11:54.960
No, there's a good chance that it is, you know, some sort of frame. Is Tyler maybe a medium wonder?

11:56.720 --> 12:01.760
Not a small one, but an okay size. Yeah, it's okay size wonder. It's a medium wonder. Oh,

12:01.760 --> 12:07.040
all right. I've got to refuel. When you say eating, do you ever see the food actually go

12:07.040 --> 12:12.480
into Tyler's mouth and then defecate that food out later? Or maybe he just dumps out his chest

12:12.480 --> 12:17.840
cavity. Have you followed it start to finish? Is his head a Mr. Fusion machine like in Back to

12:17.840 --> 12:23.200
the Future 2? These are all good questions. These are the people, and these are the exact

12:23.200 --> 12:31.280
circumstances those people can be in, in which you can refer to eating food as refueling. If you are

12:31.280 --> 12:37.200
a snowboarder who is on the slopes, and you've just carved a very, very sick line, and you've done all

12:37.200 --> 12:42.400
the tricks, and I'm talking about Olympic level, you know, grabs and spins, and then you get to

12:42.400 --> 12:49.920
the bottom, and you pop into the lodge, and you grab a quick like, you know. No, I think you just

12:49.920 --> 12:54.960
maybe even pull some jerky out of your fanny pack, and you eat some jerky, and you say,

12:54.960 --> 13:02.400
gotta refuel. That's okay, because you've just done things that I think could necessitate fuel.

13:03.680 --> 13:09.280
Or a mountain biker. If you're a mountain biker, and you just really any sort of downhill activities,

13:09.280 --> 13:13.680
and you reach the bottom of the hill, and you want to go again, any food you eat at that point,

13:13.680 --> 13:19.360
I think you can say, time to refuel, bro. Surfers, I think, can also, you pat the tummy after doing

13:19.360 --> 13:23.680
a good pipe, and then you have to pat the tummy, and you say, gotta refuel before I can get out

13:23.680 --> 13:30.800
there, and that's about it. Query for you, Griffin. Yes. Query. I am a blue belt in Taekwondo. My body

13:30.800 --> 13:36.560
is legally classified as a weapon at this point. Yeah, you are, you're on the registry.

13:36.560 --> 13:43.120
Master Cricket Trise Taekwondo says that my reaction time at this point is probably five

13:43.120 --> 13:48.160
percent better than someone who hasn't studied as long as I have, so I'm basically a weapon.

13:48.160 --> 13:56.320
And a wonderland. If I eat, like when I eat my quest bar, can I say, I've gotta reload?

13:57.440 --> 14:05.920
Reload or refuel? Reload. Am I reloading my weapon if I'm just eating a quest bar? I'm reloading the

14:05.920 --> 14:10.960
weapon. I do think, to Griffin's point, and I think in all the scenarios Griffin listed,

14:10.960 --> 14:16.080
it has to be, like you have, like if you flip somebody, right, then immediately

14:16.080 --> 14:22.080
eat it. There's a proximity to the event. It has to be immediate. You flip somebody which,

14:22.080 --> 14:26.400
um, based on what I know about sort of the classes you attend as, you know, a ten-year-old,

14:26.400 --> 14:30.640
and then you flip them and they land real hard, and then you say like, gotta reload,

14:30.640 --> 14:33.040
and you open up your mouth and you unwrap the quest bar and you go,

14:35.040 --> 14:38.400
and maybe like another combatant's coming at you and you put your hand out for a second,

14:38.400 --> 14:43.200
take a bite of the quest bar, and then suddenly you grow like six inches and then flip them again.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.080
Yeah, you must get stronger after eating the quest bar.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.480
I eat my quest bar right before class usually, so could I say like,

14:50.480 --> 14:54.240
sorry, hold on, Master Croc, gotta cock the food gun.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.640
Yeah, gotta stockpile some punch ammo.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.640
Yes, yes, yes. This all works. I do think that there's a certain amount of time after,

15:02.640 --> 15:07.760
like you can't finish class, go home, watch like an episode of Drunk History,

15:08.400 --> 15:12.000
and maybe take a nap and then wake up and say, gotta reload.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.240
Gotta refuel. It's weird.

15:14.240 --> 15:19.520
I had a fun experience in Taekwondo class a little bit ago I wanted to share with y'all.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.760
We were doing a thing kind of like conditioning, you know, a lot of it's just like building up

15:25.760 --> 15:28.720
your cardiovascular health, that kind of thing. It's great for you.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.400
So we were doing this thing where we had to like do, I think,

15:32.400 --> 15:37.600
round kicks on a bag as many times as we could in a minute,

15:37.600 --> 15:43.840
and another guy in my class who is a great guy, but for some reason it was just the two of us in

15:43.840 --> 15:48.320
class, so I got weirdly competitive. So he kicked the bag like 40 times in a minute,

15:48.320 --> 15:52.640
and he was like really winded, and I was like, I'm gonna fuck this guy up.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.760
So I kicked the bag 50 times in a minute.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.320
Whoa.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.240
And yeah, I kicked the bag 50 times in a minute, and then Master Croc was like,

16:00.240 --> 16:02.400
wow, Dustin, good job, I'm very proud of you.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.280
And then I took four steps away and threw up on the floor.

16:05.280 --> 16:12.800
That's amazing, because I was also about to ask,

16:12.800 --> 16:14.880
do you think that your master was about to be like,

16:14.880 --> 16:18.080
you're the chosen one, and then you vomit, and he's like, wait, never.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.160
Probably for about four seconds he was like that.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.600
Now just something I gotta say, right there is a perfect refuel opportunity.

16:23.600 --> 16:29.040
That is, the things I wanted to refuel on though was like oxygen.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.840
I don't think that's what I didn't have enough of in that moment.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.440
Oxygenated blood would be great to reload that in the chamber.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.800
I joined a, when I was living in LA, I joined a gym,

16:38.800 --> 16:42.880
and along with it came like one free consultation with a personal trainer.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.600
And the personal trainer was talking to me, and they were like,

16:45.600 --> 16:46.800
so what's your level of it?

16:46.800 --> 16:48.800
I was like, let me stop you there, the answer is not.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.960
And he was like, well, let me run you through some stuff.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.160
And we did 10 seconds of like these jumping things,

16:54.160 --> 16:56.880
and I went in the bathroom and threw up, and I came back,

16:56.880 --> 16:58.560
and he was like, are you ready to keep going?

16:58.560 --> 17:02.560
And I was like, in what way is me throwing up not the end of this?

17:02.560 --> 17:04.480
Well, they were called burpees, Trav.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.120
They're called burpees, Trav, so you really should have seen it coming.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.720
I mean, I guess.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.760
I never went back, and he like called me once a month like,

17:11.760 --> 17:13.200
hey, just wondering if you wanted to pick up.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.920
I was like, I am all set, thank you very much.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.120
To continue the metaphor, my non-existent exercise regimen

17:20.080 --> 17:24.720
is as such that I am essentially standing at my own fuel pump,

17:25.440 --> 17:27.840
just letting the thing overflow.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.560
I am, if anything, I am over-fueled,

17:30.560 --> 17:35.440
and there's about ankle-high sort of pool of fuel

17:35.440 --> 17:38.640
just laying on the ground that I am just not burning.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.360
And really, that's in preparation for if shit goes down,

17:41.920 --> 17:47.920
my body will be just crazy and wild and just ready for action.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.920
But it's really a fire hazard.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.840
How about another question?

17:51.840 --> 17:52.960
Please do this.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.760
My friend is a very kind person,

17:55.760 --> 17:58.320
and she got a cute poster for me as a gift,

17:58.320 --> 18:00.160
or else I think it was meant to be a gift.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.920
A lot of bad gifts this week, huh?

18:02.560 --> 18:05.600
Well, it's not the gift that was the problem this time, if you read on.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.480
The thing is, we were both so socially awkward,

18:08.480 --> 18:11.360
I'm afraid she might have just been showing it to me,

18:11.360 --> 18:13.200
and I assumed it was a gift,

18:13.200 --> 18:16.400
and she was too nervous to say that she was just showing it to me.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.440
My question is this.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.280
Is there a socially acceptable way to ask someone after the fact

18:21.280 --> 18:23.440
whether or not something was actually a gift or not,

18:23.440 --> 18:26.080
or am I doomed to live out the rest of my days wondering

18:26.080 --> 18:28.880
whether or not I'm a socially awkward poster thief?

18:28.880 --> 18:31.600
That's from Possible Poster Pinscher and KCMO.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.680
You've actually come to the right place,

18:35.680 --> 18:39.680
because literally every time we have ever done a signing

18:39.680 --> 18:43.600
or just signed stuff for people after a show,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.840
like literally four to five times,

18:45.840 --> 18:49.280
I will be presented a picture or art or something,

18:49.280 --> 18:50.960
and it's always beautiful,

18:50.960 --> 18:53.920
and I'm always running the math in my head like,

18:53.920 --> 18:58.960
am I to sign this or is this a gift to me?

18:58.960 --> 19:02.640
Because if I ask, is this a gift, I cannot-

19:02.640 --> 19:04.080
It sounds terrible.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.280
It sounds terrible.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.000
And this did happen to me once.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.240
Yeah, we actively took something.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.920
Somebody showed me a thing.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.120
I was like, oh, this is great,

19:13.120 --> 19:15.680
and I went and handed it to Teresa, and then I came back,

19:15.680 --> 19:17.600
and they said, I do need that back.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.560
And I was like, oh, yeah.

19:18.560 --> 19:23.200
After one live show, I was doing my usual running

19:23.200 --> 19:25.600
along the front of the stage, high-fiving people,

19:25.600 --> 19:27.840
and somebody pointed to a hat they had.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.920
I think the hat said Sweet Baby Brother

19:29.920 --> 19:31.120
or something like that on it.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.320
I forget what it said.

19:32.320 --> 19:36.080
But I took the hat, and I took it,

19:36.080 --> 19:37.680
and I was backstage reading Twitter,

19:37.680 --> 19:39.440
seeing how people thought the show went,

19:39.440 --> 19:41.200
and I got a tweet from somebody who was like,

19:42.560 --> 19:43.920
geez, I'd love that hat back.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.160
I really love that hat.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.160
That is maybe the worst offense of all,

19:50.160 --> 19:52.560
is there was no body language there to suggest,

19:52.560 --> 19:54.240
like, here's a hat for you.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.440
Although it did say something

19:55.440 --> 19:57.440
that is one of my titles on it.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.120
It might as well have said Griffin's hat.

19:59.680 --> 20:00.800
It was your IP.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.080
It was my IP.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.920
And that's it, Griffin didn't take it to wear it.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.840
He took it because it was copyright infringement.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.760
No, and I immediately incinerated it.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.280
That's a very different situation

20:09.280 --> 20:13.440
from when Christian Novelty Music artist Mark Lowry

20:13.440 --> 20:16.800
stole my hat at a concert because he wanted to wear it.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.120
He knew it was an Atlanta Falcons hat,

20:19.120 --> 20:21.520
and that's his, I guess, his team as well.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.320
So he thought that he had dominion over my hat.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.080
He did it on purpose? He coveted your hat?

20:26.080 --> 20:27.040
He did it on purpose.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.560
He coveted my hat, which is a sin.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.440
Thank you, Travis.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.200
And then he threw it into the crowd,

20:31.200 --> 20:32.480
like, oh, wild show, Mark.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.240
Can I get my hat back?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.520
He threw it into the crowd as though

20:35.520 --> 20:37.680
he could not return it to me.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.160
Like, what an asshole.

20:40.160 --> 20:44.400
Yeah, he was like halfway down the arena at that point,

20:44.400 --> 20:45.680
and he just chucked into the crowd like,

20:45.680 --> 20:47.040
oh man, what a fun show.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.920
And there's like, it's a weird thing of statistics

20:49.920 --> 20:54.080
because like, statistically, nobody cared about that hat.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.480
Like, you weighed the statistics of the crowd.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.760
Statistically, everybody thought,

20:57.760 --> 21:00.560
oh man, that was just like a fun interaction that he had.

21:00.560 --> 21:05.600
And if you did the stats, it'd be like 1,999% of the people

21:05.600 --> 21:06.320
did not care.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.840
And then there's like one statistical outlier that was me

21:09.840 --> 21:11.920
that would like his hat back, please, Mark.

21:11.920 --> 21:12.480
Now, Mark-

21:12.480 --> 21:15.440
What I will say is, I think this is like a very funny

21:15.440 --> 21:16.240
situation.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.240
Like, we have a good laugh about this

21:18.240 --> 21:21.920
after when we're debriefing about the many, many sort

21:21.920 --> 21:26.320
of societal norms we fucked up during each and every signing

21:26.320 --> 21:30.480
because it's incalculable how many times we goof up just

21:30.480 --> 21:32.320
talking to and interacting with other humans.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.800
And we have a good laugh.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.000
Oh boy, can you believe you tried

21:36.000 --> 21:40.160
to steal that person's hat and either failed or succeeded?

21:40.960 --> 21:42.960
And so I don't think there's any problem with you

21:42.960 --> 21:44.400
going to this person and being like, hey,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.560
I have a weird question, but was that a gift

21:46.560 --> 21:48.000
or were you just showing it to me?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.080
Because there's no like bad-

21:50.720 --> 21:52.480
If they're like, no, it was a gift, you goofus.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.400
You can say like, okay, well, I didn't know

21:54.400 --> 21:55.280
and I was worried about it.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.640
Then I think you can kind of laugh it off.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.880
Or if they say like, yeah, I was just showing it to you

21:58.880 --> 22:00.640
and you took it and I didn't know how to respond.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.760
And that's kind of funny too.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.040
And they will give it back.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.520
I don't think you have to worry too much about bringing this up.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.480
Well, you could also just like find a copy of the poster

22:08.480 --> 22:11.680
and get them one too and be like, now we're poster buddies.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.360
Yeah, it's like if you steal a car,

22:13.360 --> 22:15.680
as long as you buy them another car that looks like the car,

22:15.680 --> 22:17.040
then you're totally fine.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.400
Wouldn't you want- Wait, hold on.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.160
Though, honestly, if someone stole your car

22:20.160 --> 22:21.680
and you're like, ah, someone stole my car.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.520
And then you went outside the next day

22:23.520 --> 22:25.840
and there was a brand new version of that car.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, no, I mean, the thing I said was nonsense.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.080
The thing I said was absolute dookie nonsense.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.480
And I wasn't expecting one of you to call me on it,

22:32.480 --> 22:34.240
but I guess you did.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.000
And now this is where we're at.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.760
My assumption, this is my question.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.320
My assumption is that Mark Lowry

22:40.320 --> 22:42.320
probably doesn't remember stealing my hat.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.120
Yeah.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.200
The day that Mark Lowry stole your hat

22:45.200 --> 22:47.280
was the most important day of your life.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.840
To me, it was Tuesday.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.880
I always assume that.

22:52.880 --> 22:56.560
But we have very clear, visceral memories

22:56.560 --> 22:58.640
of every time we've ever fucked up.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.280
Do you think that if I were to grill Mark Lowry,

23:01.280 --> 23:03.040
he'd be like, ah, Justin.

23:03.040 --> 23:03.760
Oh, man.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.240
Hey, bud.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.640
I think about that hat every day.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.280
If you really want to Zap Rooter this event

23:09.280 --> 23:12.160
that happened, this shared event in years of Mark Lowry's life,

23:12.160 --> 23:14.400
the only reason he would wander back into the crowd

23:14.400 --> 23:17.200
and throw the hat to a random person is,

23:17.200 --> 23:18.640
A, he didn't know where you were,

23:18.640 --> 23:21.280
but B, he knew he couldn't keep this hat.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.640
He had absolved himself of the hat theft guilt.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.280
It was a serendipity moment where he knew someday

23:27.280 --> 23:28.720
that hat would make it back to you.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.480
And if you're listening to this right now

23:30.480 --> 23:30.880
and you're looking at your manhole-

23:30.880 --> 23:32.240
And you're at a Mark Lowry concert

23:32.240 --> 23:34.480
and you got hit in the face with the sharp bill

23:34.480 --> 23:37.440
of an Atlanta Falcons cap and kept it out of spite.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.440
Somewhere there was a huge fan of Mark Lowry

23:39.440 --> 23:41.360
who has saved this hat as a memento

23:41.360 --> 23:42.320
of the greatest day in their life

23:42.320 --> 23:43.920
when Mark Lowry threw a hat to them.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.600
And they are listening to this right now.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.360
Get that to Justin.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.320
It is a pretty damning comment or I guess

23:51.120 --> 23:53.840
darning comment on Mark Lowry

23:53.840 --> 23:54.880
because he's a Christian music artist.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.280
It is a pretty damning comment on Mark Lowry.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.520
The way his brain work was,

23:59.520 --> 24:01.600
well, I took it from the crowd

24:01.600 --> 24:03.520
and I gave it back to the crowd.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.640
So I guess I'm okay.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.280
Go back from whence you came, hat.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.600
I think Mark suffers from the same

24:09.600 --> 24:12.800
awkward sort of social issues

24:12.800 --> 24:14.160
that the three of us have.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.320
Where if somebody, I took somebody's hat

24:16.320 --> 24:17.920
from the crowd at a live show

24:17.920 --> 24:19.040
and then wanted to give it back to them

24:19.040 --> 24:20.480
but did not know where they are.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.920
I absolutely would just ultimate that motherfucker

24:23.920 --> 24:25.440
right back down the center aisle

24:25.440 --> 24:27.120
as hard as I possibly could.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.360
Because at that point, I know I've still fucked up

24:29.360 --> 24:33.040
but I at least will not have this reminder

24:33.040 --> 24:35.360
on my dome constantly.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.360
I think that Mark did the only logical thing

24:37.360 --> 24:40.400
and I think we need to cut him some fucking slack.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.040
Well, he did what we macros would have called yours now.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.080
Yeah.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.880
Which the last person to be touching the thing

24:46.880 --> 24:50.000
just inherits the responsibility of having

24:50.000 --> 24:52.240
to deal with the repercussions of having that thing.

24:52.240 --> 24:52.800
Sure.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.240
I got a quick Yahoo real quick

24:54.240 --> 24:55.200
before we get to the money.

24:55.200 --> 24:55.440
Yeah.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.000
It was sent in by-

24:56.000 --> 24:58.240
Do we don't want to talk about Mark Lowry anymore?

24:58.240 --> 25:00.240
No, I think we've ostracized our audience enough

25:00.240 --> 25:00.800
for one episode.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.840
My brother, my brother and you.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.800
Hannah Troxel sent this one in.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.280
Thank you, Hannah.

25:05.280 --> 25:09.600
It's Yahoo answers user, serve the servants asks.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.360
This is a quick one.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.360
Just looking for a quick answer from you guys.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.320
Straw poll.

25:14.320 --> 25:14.640
Okay.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.640
If Jurassic Park was real, would you go?

25:17.360 --> 25:17.680
Cool.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.840
Okay, wait.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.920
There's a very important factor here I need to know

25:21.920 --> 25:23.680
and maybe we can just acknowledge this

25:23.680 --> 25:24.720
and then put it away.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.240
Is Jurassic Park real in a world

25:28.240 --> 25:30.720
in which we have all seen the Jurassic Park movies?

25:32.080 --> 25:33.600
I would think no.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.840
Then yes, I would go.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.480
Hands down.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.240
Okay, then what if the answer is yes?

25:38.240 --> 25:39.280
Then no, I would not go.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.440
I've seen what happens when we meddle in God's play place.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.040
I do not know.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.400
The more interesting question is

25:47.200 --> 25:48.800
you see a news story.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.000
You're you, okay?

25:50.000 --> 25:50.880
But it's tomorrow.

25:52.320 --> 25:52.960
Wait, slow down.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, you're you, but it's tomorrow

25:56.000 --> 25:57.520
and you just see a sign that's like

25:58.080 --> 26:01.680
real Jurassic Park open, believe it or not.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.040
Did you say Jurassic?

26:03.040 --> 26:03.680
You did.

26:03.680 --> 26:04.720
No, is that a mix of-

26:04.720 --> 26:06.880
Real Gibroni Park is open.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.120
These dinosaurs are real Gibronis.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.800
I'm gonna crotch chop all these T-Rexes.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.000
It's real Jurassic Park,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.480
except they're aware also of the films.

26:22.480 --> 26:26.080
So they're like, listen, it's not gonna be like this.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.280
We know how this sounds.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.040
We know how it sounds.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.320
It's not gonna be like that.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.480
We've taken every precaution.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.320
This is, listen, can't stress enough,

26:34.320 --> 26:35.920
we have also seen the movies.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.440
We have been so careful.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.560
We know about our brand.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.960
I guess I am describing Jurassic World

26:40.960 --> 26:42.000
at this point, I guess.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.320
But it's like, yes, we know.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.040
We get it.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.720
We get your hesitation.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.280
But it is real Jurassic Park and we fixed it.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.000
And Travis, you have the only-

26:54.000 --> 26:55.760
Okay, here, let me sweeten the pot for you.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.400
It's not sweeten.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.840
It's like sweetening the question.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.600
You have a ticket, but it is for opening day.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.960
At real Jurassic Park.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.440
But they swear, but they swear.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.160
I'm more likely to go on opening day,

27:08.160 --> 27:10.160
because that's when they're gonna be most on point.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.680
You don't wanna go two years in

27:11.680 --> 27:13.440
when they started to get lax with it.

27:13.440 --> 27:18.240
Yeah, you get fucking Chester, the townie,

27:18.240 --> 27:20.480
watching the fucking raptor cages,

27:20.480 --> 27:21.920
like, oh, come on, boys.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.040
I just got a text.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
Uh-oh, I turned my back on the raptor cages.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.320
Now I've been destroyed.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.240
That logic doesn't hold, Travis.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.760
You look at opening day of like,

27:29.760 --> 27:33.120
Magic Kingdom or Epcot, when those open,

27:33.120 --> 27:34.960
and they were up against the clock,

27:34.960 --> 27:38.480
but you had huge breakdown in Ride, Space Mountain.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.320
And Mickey ate all those people.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.920
Mickey did eat all the kids, yeah.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.800
Was broken down more than it was open.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.920
I mean, both of those were because they were so taxed

27:47.920 --> 27:50.160
by the crowds of people that were there.

27:50.160 --> 27:50.960
Snap is.

27:50.960 --> 27:56.160
Yeah, I don't think that doesn't inoculate you, I think.

27:56.160 --> 27:56.720
Let me-

27:56.720 --> 27:57.760
Because they're not ready for that,

27:57.760 --> 27:59.680
that number of people.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.640
Let me hit you with this plot for Jurassic World 2.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.140
Okay.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.360
Me as John Hammond Jr. Jr.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.160
Uh-huh.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.920
And I'm like, I got it this time.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.040
I'm gonna do it again.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.080
And then I'm gonna have like a board of people who are like,

28:14.880 --> 28:17.600
no, so, so many people have died.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.200
You've done this eight times, John.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.240
It's never worked.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.640
And I say, don't worry.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.240
First of all, shut up.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.840
You don't tell me what to do.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.960
My family made dinosaurs happen again.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.480
New Jurassic World, and you're gonna love this.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.080
It's just all brontosauruses.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.880
Roll credits, no action, don't worry about it.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.840
Never been a brontosaurus based death in those movies.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.960
These gentle giants would never step on a toddler.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.400
I love these gentle giants.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.640
They're not going, unless the toddler is made of leaves

28:46.640 --> 28:50.080
or maybe the only thing is just like, you open it up

28:50.080 --> 28:51.360
and it's all brontosauruses.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.840
And then you're like, oh, it'll be totally safe.

28:53.840 --> 28:58.160
And then, you know, fucking Andy from Parks and Rec is there

28:58.160 --> 28:59.760
and he's like, I don't know about this.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.640
I think it's gonna go bad.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.760
And then everybody else is like, don't worry about it.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.040
It's all brontosauruses.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.560
And it's like, okay, here they come.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.920
Open up the gates, everybody comes in.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.600
It's like, hi, welcome to Jurassic World.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.040
Here's your ghillie suit.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.160
And it's like, no, no, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

29:12.160 --> 29:16.080
It is wild when you think about the original Jurassic Park.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.520
First time, right?

29:17.520 --> 29:20.880
There was definitely a moment where somebody like,

29:20.880 --> 29:22.880
knock, knock, knock on John Hammond's head.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.640
Knock, knock on John Hammond's door.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.440
He looks up from his dope ice cream, spared no expense.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.360
Looks at them in the face and they're like,

29:29.360 --> 29:31.680
hey, should we make a T-Rex?

29:31.680 --> 29:32.880
And he was like, oh, hell yeah.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.000
Yeah, definitely.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.240
Well, John, hold on, I know I asked,

29:36.240 --> 29:39.680
but you can see how this goes bad, right?

29:39.680 --> 29:41.360
Should we make velociraptors?

29:41.360 --> 29:44.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, that'd be great.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.760
The logic there is that like,

29:45.760 --> 29:47.920
if you made a park with dinosaurs,

29:47.920 --> 29:51.520
people wouldn't come unless it had dope ones that they liked.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.640
Are you kidding me, John?

29:52.640 --> 29:53.680
Hold on, I would like,

29:53.680 --> 29:56.080
this is my plot for Jurassic World too, right?

29:56.080 --> 29:59.680
Open it up, they have made one Triceratops.

29:59.680 --> 30:02.400
Big initial, big initial opening.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.400
Everybody goes, I think two years in,

30:04.400 --> 30:07.120
it's like, well, we're bankrupt, rule credits.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.400
Nobody came anymore.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.840
Everybody got bored with dinosaurs.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.960
Everybody saw the one Triceratops we made.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.800
Okay, here's my-

30:13.800 --> 30:17.360
What if you got to keep a Triceratops when you left?

30:17.360 --> 30:19.440
That is, I will say, my one logical problem

30:19.440 --> 30:21.760
with Jurassic World is there is a line,

30:21.760 --> 30:23.760
I think, where Bryce Dallas Howard says,

30:23.760 --> 30:24.840
you know what people want?

30:24.840 --> 30:26.160
Bigger dinosaurs.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.160
And I said, I don't think that's true.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.120
What everybody wants is like a tiny T-Rex

30:30.120 --> 30:32.800
they can keep in an aquarium on their desk.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.760
Like, that would be sick.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.760
If you're gonna manufacture different sized dinosaurs,

30:36.760 --> 30:38.840
make me a really tiny brontosaurus.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.640
Give me a digipet is basically what I want.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.680
And also, Bryce, I think you've misunderstood

30:43.680 --> 30:46.720
what the audience for this amusement park wants,

30:46.720 --> 30:49.480
and that is to visit it and not be destroyed

30:49.480 --> 30:51.480
by a powerful dinosaur jaw.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.920
Is my number one thing.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.240
If I heard, we got a new Jurassic World,

30:55.240 --> 30:57.920
and here's the attraction that you're just gonna go nuts for,

30:57.920 --> 31:00.200
we've made bigger, more deadly dinosaurs,

31:00.200 --> 31:02.600
I would say, well, y'all have really lost the,

31:02.600 --> 31:05.920
I can see the review on, you know, The Verge.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.760
Like, I feel like their hearts

31:07.760 --> 31:09.520
in the wrong place on this one.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.600
I feel like maybe they should focus more

31:11.600 --> 31:15.520
on dinosaurs that won't destroy the children

31:15.520 --> 31:16.360
with the powerful jaws and claws.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.000
Tiny dinosaurs like the ones from Peelee's Playhouse.

31:19.000 --> 31:19.840
That's what I want.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.660
Those are fun.

31:20.660 --> 31:21.720
We're talking.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.600
Here's my pitch for Jurassic Park 3.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.960
Even though I made one, here's what I would do,

31:26.960 --> 31:29.880
probably fail at me remake Jurassic Park 3.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.960
Still Griffin is John Hammond Jr. Jr.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.320
Because I love this character of John Hammond Jr. Jr.,

31:34.320 --> 31:36.000
sort of a petulant descendant.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.200
He's a real pissy, real pissy mess.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.960
And there's just so many merch opportunities.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.520
Yeah, he inherited the whole thing.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.800
And Jurassic Park 3 is about him going to Isla Sorna

31:46.800 --> 31:49.160
because they wiped out all the ones on Isla Nubar.

31:49.160 --> 31:53.800
But he goes to Isla Sorna and he just is gonna take them all

31:53.800 --> 31:55.000
because they're his.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.040
So the movie is about, these are my dinosaurs.

31:58.040 --> 32:03.040
My pap pap made them and I'm gonna put them all on my boat

32:03.320 --> 32:04.800
and take them to my house.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.840
Yeah, you can't eat me, T-Rex.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.960
I'm your uncle, basically.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.080
Basically your uncle.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.920
You wouldn't eat your uncle, would you?

32:12.920 --> 32:14.880
Put you in a boat and take you to my home

32:14.880 --> 32:16.760
because you're my dinosaur because of my pap pap.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.120
And now it's we bought a zoo.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.040
It's like we bought a Jurassic Park and it's like,

32:20.040 --> 32:21.920
I don't know, this is really gonna put some stress

32:21.920 --> 32:22.760
on the family.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.760
Like what, having a bunch of velociraptors around?

32:25.760 --> 32:27.040
Come on, Susan.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.360
These are my velociraptors.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.560
They're my nephews and I love them.

32:30.560 --> 32:31.720
They listen to me.

32:31.720 --> 32:32.540
They don't.

32:32.540 --> 32:33.380
They listen to me.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.800
They don't, they super don't.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.840
Just stop putting meat eaters in your,

32:36.840 --> 32:38.960
stop putting carnivores, just put herbivores.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.400
I would have gone to Jurassic Park

32:40.400 --> 32:42.440
for the opportunity to meet Wade Knight.

32:42.440 --> 32:45.280
Like you don't need to put a bunch of dinosaurs in there.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.720
Okay, wait, hold on.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.040
What people want is bigger Wayne.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.200
What I have done, I made a 10-foot Wayne Knight

32:52.200 --> 32:53.740
and he is an herbivore.

32:53.740 --> 32:54.720
He's an herbivore.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.960
We got him eating kale and he's just crazy about it.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.280
We keep him in this big pen.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.620
We cloned a bunch of Wayne Knights.

33:01.620 --> 33:04.400
I found a Wayne Knight and a piece of amber.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.600
Oh boy.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.320
Oh my God, Wayne Knight is pregnant.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.800
Nature finds a way.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.560
Nature finds a way.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.040
Let's go to the money's end.

33:12.040 --> 33:17.040
Just add the pregnant Wayne Knight to my Tumblr tags

33:26.680 --> 33:27.800
and we're good to go.

33:27.800 --> 33:28.760
Hey everybody.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.600
Do you want to make a fan site for pregnant Wayne Knight?

33:31.600 --> 33:33.320
The pregnant Wayne Knight fan site?

33:33.320 --> 33:34.160
Sure you do.

33:34.160 --> 33:34.980
We all do.

33:34.980 --> 33:35.820
But how?

33:35.820 --> 33:37.320
You don't know anything about coding.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.720
You don't know shit.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.080
Well, with Squarespace, you can.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.640
You can make a cool website dedicated

33:44.640 --> 33:46.760
to just about anything you want

33:46.760 --> 33:48.400
and you can publish content there,

33:48.400 --> 33:52.360
links to videos, sell products and services.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.040
Great for if you want to keep people up to date

33:55.040 --> 33:59.720
for announcements or upcoming events or anything like that.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.760
Squarespace is perfect.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.880
I've made a couple of websites on Squarespace now

34:02.880 --> 34:05.300
and I don't know anything about building websites,

34:05.300 --> 34:07.400
but Squarespace makes it so easy

34:07.400 --> 34:09.640
to just like add in the elements that you need

34:09.640 --> 34:11.360
and anything you don't understand,

34:11.360 --> 34:14.280
they have 24-7 award-winning customer support

34:14.280 --> 34:17.120
and I will say, and the copy doesn't say this,

34:17.120 --> 34:18.480
but I found it so useful.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.240
There are like countless YouTube videos that are like,

34:21.240 --> 34:22.080
oh, you want to do this?

34:22.080 --> 34:23.240
Here's how.

34:23.240 --> 34:24.240
Yeah, it's super easy.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.080
I mean, Travis made mackerelishows.com.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.280
I made griffinmackerel.com.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.040
It took like an hour.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.240
It's so easy.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.120
And there are so many different like options

34:32.120 --> 34:33.440
for stuff you can do.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.800
And if you do know about coding,

34:35.800 --> 34:37.960
there's also areas where you can add HTML

34:37.960 --> 34:41.360
and that kind of thing to customize it even more.

34:41.360 --> 34:45.120
And you can find your own domains like Justin does

34:45.120 --> 34:47.120
and make the website really your own.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.800
So if you want to check it out,

34:48.800 --> 34:51.120

all one word.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.480
I want to tell you about SAMPS.com.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.400
Here's a New Year's resolution you can actually keep.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.020
I know this is still on the forefront of everybody's minds

35:11.020 --> 35:12.280
is these resys.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.820
You can add SAMPS.com to your business

35:15.280 --> 35:17.480

35:17.480 --> 35:20.080
of the US Postal Service right to your computer.

You can use your computer to print US postage

35:21.760 --> 35:23.540
for any letter or package, any class of mail,

35:23.540 --> 35:25.560
and then the mail carrier comes

35:25.560 --> 35:27.440
and picks it right up from you.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.320
SAMPS.com can also send you a digital scale

35:29.320 --> 35:31.700
that automatically calculates exact postage.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.240
It's really very, very convenient.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.480
Sometimes you're not able to leave the house

35:36.480 --> 35:38.120
and go run to the post office,

35:38.120 --> 35:41.040
and so they bring the magic of the post office to you.

35:41.040 --> 35:41.880
So right now you can enjoy the SAMPS.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.960
If anything, I would say that it's too convenient.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.920
Sometimes I just mail stuff because I can.

35:45.920 --> 35:46.920
You know what I mean?

35:46.920 --> 35:50.080
I just pick up a piece of paper, SAMPS.com it,

35:50.080 --> 35:51.640
put it in the mail, get it out there.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.440
And then people are like, there's nothing on this.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.800
I mailed Travis some garbage

35:54.800 --> 35:56.520
that I just didn't feel like standing up

35:56.520 --> 35:57.680
and going to the trash can.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.520
That was garbage?

35:58.520 --> 36:00.380
Yeah, it was garbage.

36:00.380 --> 36:02.200
Yeah, well, you're the trash king.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.260
Anyway, right now you can enjoy

36:03.260 --> 36:05.040
the SAMPS.com service with a special offer

36:05.040 --> 36:06.360

just go to SAMPS.com, click on the microphone

36:12.440 --> 36:15.000
at the top of the homepage, and type in my brother.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
At SAMPS.com, enter my brother.

36:17.000 --> 36:17.880
All one word.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.200
My brother. All one word.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.080
You're wondering if Torcy would win

36:21.080 --> 36:23.440
in a knockdown dragout brawl against Dunkey?

36:23.440 --> 36:25.240
Those are characters that we created,

36:25.240 --> 36:29.720
so this is a IP-violating Jumbotron message.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.720
Maybe you've pondered if Titliquid, okay,

36:31.720 --> 36:34.240
would emerge victorious from a back alley free-for-all?

36:34.240 --> 36:35.240
Absolutely would.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.400
No question about it.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.220
No question.

36:37.220 --> 36:38.740
On the Ultimate Showdown podcast,

36:38.740 --> 36:41.060
we don't debate those specific fights, sorry,

36:41.060 --> 36:43.200
but we do debate other great matchups for the ages,

36:43.200 --> 36:45.360
like Punisher versus Beatrix Kiddo,

36:45.360 --> 36:47.580
or Fezzik versus Jaws.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.080
Join Tristan the Marine.

36:49.080 --> 36:49.920
What's up?

36:49.920 --> 36:50.860
Cheryl. What's up?

36:50.860 --> 36:52.860
Cheryl Cannon and Fowler each week

36:52.860 --> 36:55.120
as they debate the age-old question,

36:55.120 --> 36:58.120
who would win in a fight?

36:58.120 --> 37:00.480
And that show is called Ultimate Showdown.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.240
You can look for it wherever you download podcasts,

37:04.240 --> 37:05.800
and remember, fight it out,

37:05.800 --> 37:07.960
but be excellent to each other.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.160
Do you want me to read this next one?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.960
Yes. Yes, I do.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.440
This message is for Sunflower Station,

37:13.440 --> 37:15.800
and it's from Sunflower Station,

37:15.800 --> 37:20.080
who says, oh man, hello?

37:20.080 --> 37:21.920
Hello, Macawois?

37:21.920 --> 37:24.600
This message comes from Sunflower Station,

37:24.600 --> 37:26.640
Veyron's band of meme criminals.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.680
Thank you, Veyron, for creating a space

37:28.680 --> 37:30.600
where we can all support each other

37:30.600 --> 37:32.080
on our art and daily worries,

37:32.080 --> 37:34.160
play D&D and watch Flintstones.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.060
Viva Rock Vegas together.

37:36.060 --> 37:36.900
That's the name of the movie.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.880
I don't know why I added a period there.

37:38.880 --> 37:42.000
Here's to many more great memories and internet friends.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.240
P.S., Hamtaro Bot still sucks.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.620
Well, Hamtaro Bot has feelings.

37:46.620 --> 37:47.900
I don't know why you would say that.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.400
I also don't know if I said Veyron's name correctly,

37:50.400 --> 37:52.140
but I sure hope that I did.

37:53.440 --> 37:57.600
This is a wonderful little crowd, it sounds like,

37:57.600 --> 37:59.280
and I'm sitting here trying to think

37:59.280 --> 38:00.920
if I've seen Flintstones, Viva Rock Vegas,

38:00.920 --> 38:03.200
and the answer is no.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.360
Wait, is that the one with Kyle McLaughlin,

38:05.360 --> 38:07.020
or is that the first one?

38:07.020 --> 38:08.720
I think they both have him in it.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.600
The second one is the one with Alan Cumming

38:13.600 --> 38:14.760
as the Great Gazoo.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.600
Oh, of course.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.480
So if you have that, you would not forget that.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.320
You would not have the half of it.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.120
And which Barney is it?

38:21.960 --> 38:24.440
It's still the original, still the original cast.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.260
Are you sure?

38:25.260 --> 38:27.560
Because I think one is Rick Moranis.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're right.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.880
It's not Rick Moranis, it's a bald one.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.160
Yeah, Dick Moranis.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.360
We have another message.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.400
I'm Dick Moranis, the evil Rick Moranis.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.840
But also Rick Moranis is my brother, he's cool.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.320
Honey, I shrunk the kids, who fucking cares?

38:43.320 --> 38:44.840
I'm Dick Moranis.

38:47.100 --> 38:50.660
This is a message for A from H.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.920
To my wife and best friend, thank you for giving me Taz.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.480
And then when I ran out, NBNB AM,

38:56.480 --> 38:59.180
even starting at episode one when you said I shouldn't.

38:59.180 --> 39:02.620
I can't believe how much we've accomplished in time period,

39:02.620 --> 39:05.760
but only together could we get it done.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.800
So let's have these good, good boys

39:07.800 --> 39:10.760
tell you how much I love you, and it's a lot.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.760
You are my everything.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.800
It's very nice and also vague.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.280
That's so sweet, that's so sweet.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.240
I think it was Steven Baldwin, for the record.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.560
Hey everyone, Freddie Wong.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.400
Matt Arnold.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.220
And Will Campos.

39:23.220 --> 39:25.520
We'll tell you about Story Break, a writer's room podcast

39:25.520 --> 39:27.800
where every week we, the Hollywood geniuses

39:27.800 --> 39:30.000
behind video game high school, have one hour

39:30.000 --> 39:32.600
to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.400
Thrill as we weave the tragic tale of Jar Jar,

39:35.400 --> 39:36.400
a Star Wars story.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.960
We're going to double down on everything

39:37.960 --> 39:39.200
that made the prequels great.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.320
Jar Jar, trade federations, politics.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.880
Gasp as we assemble a pantheon of heroes

39:44.880 --> 39:46.760
for the Kellogg's cinematic universe.

39:46.760 --> 39:47.960
We could get rid of Snap, Crackle, Pop.

39:47.960 --> 39:48.560
I wouldn't even miss them.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.320
You're crazy.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.480
They die in the second act.

39:50.480 --> 39:51.920
Oh, come on.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.360
And join us as we make fun of Matt

39:53.360 --> 39:55.360
as he struggles to name a single Beyonce song.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.360
Well, yeah, put a finger on it.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.320
Sure, she wants to be Beyonce.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.120
Put a finger on it, Beyonce's famous song.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.240
Will we break the story?

40:01.240 --> 40:02.900
Or will the story break us?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.980
Find out by joining us in the writer's room every Thursday

40:04.980 --> 40:08.520
on maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.480
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Merritt Palmer.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.400
Thank you, Merritt.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.560
I've noticed a strange habit I have.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.120
If I'm at a coffee shop, I will take sips out of my empty mug.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.560
Nervous habit or what?

40:19.560 --> 40:24.080
And that was asked by me in college.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.360
It's actually an anonymous user.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.000
But we'll say it was from me in college.

40:27.000 --> 40:27.880
Additional details.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.800
I do it more when I'm staring around in space.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.880
The coffee shop is a real performative battleground,

40:34.880 --> 40:35.440
isn't it?

40:35.440 --> 40:37.680
Because you want to look like you're enjoying the coffee

40:37.680 --> 40:40.000
shop the best and most.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.480
And you sit there and the coffee's empty,

40:42.480 --> 40:44.320
but you still want to look impressive,

40:44.320 --> 40:46.280
like you understand the complexity

40:46.280 --> 40:48.900
of each beautiful bean.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.200
And so you sip it.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.000
And I would often say things, usually under my breath,

40:53.000 --> 40:58.040
but akin to like, mm, exquisite beans today.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.680
Or, mm, what a fascinating bean.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.360
Usually something complimentary about the bean.

41:03.360 --> 41:07.600
Or like, mm, I can really tell where the beans came from.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.640
And say stuff like that.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.040
Spicy note to the beans today, Michael.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.000
And usually there wasn't a Michael, but.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.360
One thing I like is complimenting the roast.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.600
Like, oh, what a flirty roast.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.760
What a flirty roast, Eddie.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.200
What a juicy roast.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.880
You really roasted the piss out of these beans.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.520
Oh, yeah, you roasted the shit out of these.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.760
These bad boys are toasty and roasty.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.440
And I can really taste the complexity of the notes.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.920
One thing to do that's good at the coffee shop

41:34.920 --> 41:39.520
that they actually like is, before they brew your coffee,

41:39.520 --> 41:43.840
ask if they can take a handful of beans and roast them more.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.480
And they can.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.400
So they just scoop some out of the machine,

41:47.400 --> 41:48.680
and then they put them in the oven

41:48.680 --> 41:52.680
that they use to heat up the turkey and cheddar sandwiches.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.920
And they'll just roast them more.

41:54.920 --> 41:58.460
And they'll, at first, they might kind of be like, huh?

41:58.460 --> 42:03.200
But then the more wizened pros at Starbucks

42:03.200 --> 42:04.720
will be like, oh, he's been around.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.600
He knows that these beans need just a second long.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.000
Right, and it's good if you wait to do this

42:10.000 --> 42:13.040
until after you sort of examine the beans.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.940
So it's like you've made a judgment call

42:14.940 --> 42:16.560
that they could probably go back.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.880
Get out your little jewelers kind of glass.

42:19.880 --> 42:20.720
Oh, that's good, yeah.

42:20.720 --> 42:21.920
Oh, that's good.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.000
One more minute.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.760
Chomp one up and crunch it until it's just coffee grounds,

42:26.760 --> 42:28.880
and then go, eh, bleh, eh, eh,

42:28.880 --> 42:31.040
and then spit it in the trash can.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.000
Because you're not gonna eat it.

42:32.000 --> 42:32.960
No.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.640
But it is, I think, nice to ask for your coffee

42:36.640 --> 42:38.600
to have a little bit of pulp.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.720
Just say, give me some of the beans sort of in there.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.680
I want to strain it with my teeth.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.560
Everybody filters out the pulp.

42:45.560 --> 42:46.400
Thank you, Griffin.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.640
That's such a good note.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.920
That's where all the nutrients are, is in the pulp.

42:49.920 --> 42:50.920
Otherwise, it's just.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.320
Make sure you ask them to leave room for the Holy Spirit.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.280
Yeah, yeah, you want room for cream,

42:56.280 --> 42:58.240
and you want a little bit of Holy Spirit in there.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.220
And then other, if you don't got pulp,

43:00.220 --> 43:02.560
we're basically just talking about hot bean water.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.400
Yeah.

43:03.400 --> 43:04.240
And that's not what God wanted.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.720
You need a better mouth feel.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.340
That's always my problem with that weak,

43:08.340 --> 43:09.820
it's just liquid coffee.

43:09.820 --> 43:10.960
Like, what's that?

43:10.960 --> 43:11.800
You know what I mean?

43:11.800 --> 43:16.720
Like, one good thing to do at the coffee store

43:16.720 --> 43:18.840
is ask for room for cream,

43:18.840 --> 43:20.840
and then when they give you your coffee,

43:20.840 --> 43:23.360
turn on your heel and walk out the door.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.260
And they're gonna take a second and be like,

43:25.260 --> 43:29.320
wait a minute, do they know about some other kind of cream

43:29.320 --> 43:30.920
that we don't have here?

43:30.920 --> 43:34.080
Like, do they have a secret good new cream

43:34.080 --> 43:36.160
that we don't have here at the Bucks?

43:36.160 --> 43:38.320
And that's gonna drive them crazy all day long.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.360
You'll have a little less coffee, but that'll be fine.

43:40.360 --> 43:44.800
Oh, you guys, you don't know about dog cream yet?

43:44.800 --> 43:46.240
Oh, boy.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.520
Well, joke's on you, I guess.

43:48.520 --> 43:52.320
You do boneless coffee and you don't use dog cream.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.040
Boy, that's a real shame.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.320
Anyway, bye.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.920
I'm very smart.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.800
You know what I like to do?

43:59.800 --> 44:01.120
I like to order coffee,

44:01.120 --> 44:03.600
but then ask for it in a bread bowl.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.440
Mm.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.760
That's nice, that's a breakfast right there.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.540
It's fun, and it's also,

44:08.540 --> 44:11.980
I don't like it when I am drinking my coffee,

44:11.980 --> 44:14.740
and I don't feel an enormous amount of pressure

44:14.740 --> 44:16.460
to drink the coffee extremely quickly

44:16.460 --> 44:18.100
before it gets everywhere.

44:18.100 --> 44:20.000
Well, and the nice thing is once you're done drinking it,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.740
you can then, you have a little coffee-soaked snack.

44:23.740 --> 44:24.580
Mm.

44:24.580 --> 44:25.400
You get a nice little burst

44:25.400 --> 44:26.740
of extra coffee there at the end.

44:26.740 --> 44:28.020
And you know what, if you eat it fast enough,

44:28.020 --> 44:29.660
you can get another cup in there,

44:29.660 --> 44:31.740
and they just keep refilling it.

44:31.740 --> 44:32.580
Yeah.

44:32.580 --> 44:34.980
Can't they do coffee in a biscotti mug?

44:34.980 --> 44:36.340
Is that something you can order?

44:36.340 --> 44:38.340
So wait, the biscotti is shaped like a mug,

44:38.340 --> 44:40.140
and you pour the coffee in it?

44:40.140 --> 44:41.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I do that?

44:41.620 --> 44:42.460
Holy shit.

44:42.460 --> 44:44.460
I mean, you would more or less have to shotgun

44:44.460 --> 44:47.300
that bean water, or else,

44:47.300 --> 44:49.780
I mean, the burns would be significant.

44:49.780 --> 44:51.620
You'd want a cold brew, for sure.

44:51.620 --> 44:52.460
Mm-hmm.

44:53.580 --> 44:56.120
Is it possible to go up to the counter and say,

44:56.120 --> 44:59.820
before you grind these little bastards down,

44:59.820 --> 45:02.460
do you mind if I sing to the beans a little bit?

45:02.460 --> 45:09.140
Can I sing at your bean box to make the beans taste

45:09.140 --> 45:09.980
even a little bit better when you roast?

45:09.980 --> 45:10.820
Is your shop offering that?

45:10.820 --> 45:11.780
You have to ask for it?

45:11.780 --> 45:12.620
Where are you going?

45:12.620 --> 45:15.980
It's so rare that they offer singing to the bean box.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.940
And yeah, I mean, I guess this is,

45:19.940 --> 45:22.660
you know, when you go to a Starbucks,

45:22.660 --> 45:23.760
don't even think about it.

45:23.760 --> 45:24.700
There's very little singing,

45:24.700 --> 45:27.260
because to them, it's a quantity game.

45:27.260 --> 45:28.100
Yeah.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.260
They can't take a minute there to sing a beautiful hymn.

45:30.260 --> 45:31.700
They might have a radio on next to it.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.740
It is not the same.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.220
No, they think that it accomplishes the same thing,

45:36.220 --> 45:37.060
but it doesn't.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.540
One thing that I like to do is say,

45:40.540 --> 45:42.540
before you grind the coffee,

45:42.540 --> 45:45.020
I bring some of my own personal blend with me

45:45.020 --> 45:45.920
everywhere I go.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.260
Can you grind that into it?

45:48.260 --> 45:50.620
And then you reach out into your pocket

45:50.620 --> 45:53.220
and you pull out a bunch of movie ticket stubs

45:53.220 --> 45:55.780
and paper clips, and then you hand that to them.

45:55.780 --> 45:58.480
And sort of let them figure it out.

45:58.480 --> 46:01.660
What I like to do is I like to go to the counter

46:01.660 --> 46:03.980
and say, hey, I would like the beans

46:03.980 --> 46:05.460
that will be in my coffee,

46:05.460 --> 46:07.100
and then I take those home,

46:07.100 --> 46:10.780
and I just sit on them for like 24, 26 hours.

46:10.780 --> 46:13.780
Then I come back, they grind those up.

46:13.780 --> 46:15.220
Yeah.

46:15.220 --> 46:17.460
And then I let someone else drink it.

46:17.460 --> 46:19.680
I like to pick each bean out of the bean box

46:19.680 --> 46:21.380
like I'm grabbing a lobster

46:21.380 --> 46:23.660
at like a nice seafood restaurant.

46:23.660 --> 46:26.720
I say, I want this bean, and this bean,

46:26.720 --> 46:29.020
and I want this bean, and I say this bean looks beautiful.

46:29.020 --> 46:29.980
No, not that bean.

46:29.980 --> 46:31.380
Oh, here we go. Next to it.

46:31.380 --> 46:32.360
And then I turn to them, I say,

46:32.360 --> 46:34.580
how many beans does it take to do one coffee?

46:34.580 --> 46:36.340
And they say like a hundred.

46:36.340 --> 46:38.980
And I say like, this is going to take too long,

46:38.980 --> 46:41.780
and it's gonna not be a very funny joke for the podcast.

46:41.780 --> 46:42.740
And then I stop.

46:42.740 --> 46:47.560
Those are some other things you can do at a coffee store.

46:47.560 --> 46:48.820
I love these weird beans.

46:48.820 --> 46:52.340
I love my weird beans.

46:52.340 --> 46:54.480
We never talk about that part of it,

46:54.480 --> 46:58.500
but you eat beans out of the can on a campfire

46:58.500 --> 47:01.180
for a good Western snack.

47:01.180 --> 47:03.500
And that's the same as what you do every morning

47:03.500 --> 47:07.780
when you get these fast beans is what I call them

47:07.780 --> 47:10.820
because they make me move just a little bit faster.

47:10.820 --> 47:12.840
And you pour hot water through them

47:12.840 --> 47:14.340
and you crunch them all up.

47:14.340 --> 47:16.500
It's basically what you're doing is,

47:16.500 --> 47:18.620
it's just bean water, folks.

47:18.620 --> 47:19.460
Whoa, slow down.

47:19.460 --> 47:20.980
We never think about that it's beans.

47:20.980 --> 47:22.500
It's beans.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.860
But it's the same kinds of beans that you would put

47:24.860 --> 47:29.140
in a chili or a bad gumbo.

47:29.140 --> 47:32.820
How do I confront my landlord about frequent pop-ins?

47:32.820 --> 47:35.180
My landlord thinks it's okay to show up whatever he wants

47:35.180 --> 47:36.700
because he thinks my roommates and I

47:36.700 --> 47:38.280
are all friends with him.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.660
In the past, he has shown up to use our kitchen table

47:40.660 --> 47:41.820
as a desk to work on.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.340
Whoa.

47:43.340 --> 47:47.180
Laying flooring until 11 p.m. on a Monday,

47:47.180 --> 47:49.980
set up a Christmas tree without request or permission.

47:49.980 --> 47:51.220
What the fuck?

47:51.220 --> 47:54.380
Borrowed our kitchen for cooking, take a shower,

47:54.380 --> 47:57.460
sleep on our couch, and worst of all offenses,

47:57.460 --> 48:02.460
host game nights at our house and then invite us,

48:02.820 --> 48:06.140
the people who actually live in the home he is renting out

48:06.140 --> 48:09.860
to join his party merely hours before being thrown.

48:09.860 --> 48:11.060
What?

48:11.060 --> 48:13.740
I am extremely non-confrontational

48:13.740 --> 48:15.460
and I'm about to explode at this point.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.340
Please, Jesus, help me, brothers.

48:17.340 --> 48:20.500
That's from Landlord in La La Land.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.380
It's good that you've asked for our help

48:22.380 --> 48:24.960
and also Jesus's help because this is gonna take

48:24.960 --> 48:27.800
all four of us on deck.

48:27.800 --> 48:30.060
I will say, okay, first question.

48:30.060 --> 48:33.660
When your landlord leaves, do they walk out

48:33.660 --> 48:37.180
and hop into the back of a white surveillance van?

48:37.180 --> 48:39.420
Because I guarantee this is an elaborate

48:39.420 --> 48:42.860
Big Brother-style TV show where they can't believe

48:42.860 --> 48:43.900
you haven't left yet.

48:43.900 --> 48:46.860
You were only supposed to be the first episode

48:46.860 --> 48:49.060
and now this has gone on for months.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.920
John Quinones has had you on the hook here

48:50.920 --> 48:53.660
for quite some time.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.540
This is his longest grift ever.

48:55.540 --> 48:57.660
This is wild, it's unacceptable.

48:57.660 --> 49:00.900
These are not pop-ins in the traditional landlord sense

49:00.900 --> 49:03.300
where they're stopping in to make sure everything's doing

49:03.300 --> 49:04.560
okay, interrupting your thing.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.260
They're throwing parties at your house.

49:06.260 --> 49:08.880
It is breaking and entering at this point.

49:09.980 --> 49:11.580
Here's how I think this shook out.

49:11.580 --> 49:14.020
The landlord thought, man, I could use

49:14.020 --> 49:15.700
a little extra income.

49:15.700 --> 49:17.460
I'm gonna rent out my house.

49:17.460 --> 49:21.340
And then you came over and you signed the lease

49:21.340 --> 49:24.140
and he gave you the keys and the door shut

49:24.140 --> 49:26.280
and then he was like, ah, shit.

49:27.380 --> 49:28.740
That's my only house.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.020
Yeah.

49:30.020 --> 49:33.380
So he is, I think, still living there, basically,

49:33.380 --> 49:36.340
is what I think has happened.

49:36.340 --> 49:40.120
Is he has mistakenly not, he has made his own property

49:40.120 --> 49:41.700
the rental property.

49:41.700 --> 49:43.860
This is the first time that I think we've gotten

49:43.860 --> 49:46.100
a question where I've been excited to see

49:46.100 --> 49:49.180
how this plays out on the next episode of Judge Judy.

49:49.180 --> 49:50.900
So there's a part of me that's kind of like,

49:50.900 --> 49:53.260
hmm, I've never seen this before.

49:53.260 --> 49:56.500
But it's such a weird, I know you're non-confrontational,

49:56.500 --> 49:58.460
but I think this is one of those rare cases

49:58.460 --> 50:01.140
that requires one of those confrontations

50:01.140 --> 50:02.220
I've heard so much about.

50:02.220 --> 50:05.620
Well, this is the thing is I get being non-confrontational

50:05.620 --> 50:07.360
where someone's like, I wanna fight you.

50:07.360 --> 50:08.660
And you're like, I don't wanna fight.

50:08.660 --> 50:11.420
But this person is actively punching you in the face.

50:11.420 --> 50:13.660
You may need to fight them, it sounds like.

50:13.660 --> 50:16.500
Yeah, it sounds like a fight may be in order.

50:16.500 --> 50:18.380
Or move.

50:18.380 --> 50:20.220
I mean, but you signed the,

50:20.220 --> 50:22.180
is there anything in the contract that says like,

50:22.180 --> 50:25.620
and by the way, whenever I wanna play Carcassonne

50:25.620 --> 50:28.340
with my buddies, you're invited,

50:28.340 --> 50:32.420
but it's gonna be in your kitchen, so deal with that.

50:32.420 --> 50:34.300
Because if so, you should have read that contract

50:34.300 --> 50:36.520
maybe a little bit closer.

50:36.520 --> 50:39.580
Otherwise, it's not acceptable.

50:39.580 --> 50:42.140
This is bad, even if I had a friend,

50:42.140 --> 50:44.520
even if my best friend was doing this,

50:44.520 --> 50:46.060
it would be a problem.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.560
All right, we've talked about how bad it is.

50:47.560 --> 50:50.320
What can we and Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior,

50:50.320 --> 50:54.220
Lamb of lambs, King of kings, do to.

50:54.220 --> 50:55.840
Son of David. Son of David.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.760
Do to make this better. The quiet storm.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.840
The quiet raging storm.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.080
The King of the North.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.520
What can all four of us do

51:07.520 --> 51:10.540
to make this a better situation for them?

51:10.540 --> 51:12.340
Change the logs.

51:12.340 --> 51:13.340
That's illegal.

51:13.340 --> 51:14.780
Is it? Yeah, probably not.

51:14.780 --> 51:17.540
What if you did it, but then pretend like you didn't?

51:17.540 --> 51:21.340
Can you invite like 200 people over to your house

51:21.340 --> 51:25.620
so that like a Tokyo train during rush hour,

51:25.620 --> 51:27.680
it's like, sorry, we're all full up.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.880
Can't get nobody else in here.

51:29.880 --> 51:32.140
If you invite enough people over to your house,

51:32.140 --> 51:33.840
you probably won't notice that he's there,

51:33.840 --> 51:36.720
which is a very good passive way of handling this.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.560
Because it's already so full.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.400
One more person is not gonna hurt.

51:40.400 --> 51:44.160
Is it possible to hire a drill bit tailor?

51:44.160 --> 51:45.000
Okay.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.620
And that movie's so important to me for so many reasons,

51:48.620 --> 51:51.400
but there's so many situations that could be required

51:51.400 --> 51:55.800
by getting a real fucking hard ass like Owen Wilson.

51:55.800 --> 51:56.720
Well, what's great, Griffin,

51:56.720 --> 51:58.360
is what we're dealing with here

51:58.360 --> 52:00.040
is a you, me, and Dupree scenario

52:00.040 --> 52:01.840
that can be fixed with a drill bit tailor scenario.

52:01.840 --> 52:03.420
With another Owen Wilson.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.400
Yeah, and if that doesn't work,

52:05.400 --> 52:07.720
then you get a- Yeah, Marma Gook?

52:07.720 --> 52:09.760
With a dog, what's the dog movie?

52:09.760 --> 52:10.580
No, the other one.

52:10.580 --> 52:13.080
The other are Marley and you. Marley and me.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.360
But Marley's a big, vicious dog

52:15.360 --> 52:16.920
who's not gonna let this gentleman

52:16.920 --> 52:18.720
to sort of stride right now. You, me, and Marley.

52:18.720 --> 52:22.440
You, me, and Marley, the battle beast.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.660
The death hound. The robot dog.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.240
It's okay, because you gotta,

52:27.240 --> 52:30.660
if you won't confront them, and I understand that,

52:30.660 --> 52:31.760
I'll do it.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.800
And I'm not, I'm pretty non-confrontational,

52:33.800 --> 52:36.440
but it sounds like you're in need of somebody

52:36.440 --> 52:39.000
to step in and say like, hey, dude,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.920
you can't just come over whenever you want.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.640
That's wild.

52:42.640 --> 52:46.280
You cannot throw parties at this house where we live.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.120
No, no, no.

52:47.120 --> 52:49.040
You need to throw your hat into the crowd.

52:49.040 --> 52:52.440
You need a new third roommate to come in and beat it back.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.420
Get Mark Lowry.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.000
Mark Lowry won't fuck around in this situation.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.760
Yeah, get Mark Lowry.

52:57.760 --> 53:00.600
It sucks, because there's really no other way around it,

53:00.600 --> 53:02.080
other than telling your landlord,

53:02.080 --> 53:03.840
like, you can't just throw,

53:03.840 --> 53:06.880
if you're really uncomfortable

53:06.880 --> 53:08.480
about being non-confrontational,

53:08.480 --> 53:10.000
wait for the last thing to happen

53:10.000 --> 53:11.320
about throwing a game night at your house

53:11.320 --> 53:13.440
without telling you, because that's unacceptable

53:13.440 --> 53:14.880
by literally anybody's standards,

53:14.880 --> 53:16.880
and your landlord also knows that it sucks

53:16.880 --> 53:18.480
and is not a cool thing to do.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.980
And if you come to them and say like,

53:19.980 --> 53:23.340
you can't just throw parties at our fucking house dog,

53:23.340 --> 53:27.760
then I, like, unless they are completely,

53:27.760 --> 53:29.600
like, removed from the situation,

53:29.600 --> 53:31.320
I think they'll understand, sort of,

53:31.320 --> 53:33.160
I think they'll grok what you're putting down here.

53:33.160 --> 53:36.720
And I think the word that you need to invoke is boundaries.

53:36.720 --> 53:37.720
We gotta have boundaries.

53:37.720 --> 53:39.800
We gotta set some boundaries here, right?

53:39.800 --> 53:43.160
Because I think that is a term that applies

53:43.160 --> 53:45.360
to every relationship that exists.

53:45.360 --> 53:48.100
So it's not about, like, I think you're a bad person,

53:48.100 --> 53:49.960
or, hey, we're not friends.

53:49.960 --> 53:53.220
It's, we need to set some boundaries.

53:53.220 --> 53:54.240
Yeah. Like, it's one thing

53:54.240 --> 53:57.080
if you wanna come over and hang out from time to time,

53:57.080 --> 53:59.740
but you can't be here when we're not here.

53:59.740 --> 54:02.000
Yeah, and again, like, if you're uncomfortable with it,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.280
hire Owen Wilson to set up these boundaries for you,

54:04.280 --> 54:05.360
and he'll just be like, sure.

54:05.360 --> 54:08.840
Oh, wow, you can't throw a party over here.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.200
Wow.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.280
So that's Owen, that's Owen Wilson.

54:12.280 --> 54:13.320
Yeah, I've been working on it,

54:13.320 --> 54:15.560
me and Brian, my voice teacher.

54:15.560 --> 54:17.860
We've been working on Owen lately.

54:17.860 --> 54:19.400
I'm gonna do some ADR work.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.700
I'm moving to Hollywood

54:20.700 --> 54:23.100
to become sort of his verbal stunt man.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.560
There's a lot of times they want Owen Wilson

54:25.560 --> 54:28.080
to say words, like potty words, that he doesn't wanna say.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.440
He hates saying these potty words.

54:29.440 --> 54:31.520
But I'll say them, I don't care.

54:31.520 --> 54:33.260
Things like bastard and piss.

54:33.260 --> 54:35.200
But I've learned to say them in his voice

54:35.200 --> 54:36.240
so that when he's on the set,

54:36.240 --> 54:38.680
and he's like, wow, I'm really off.

54:38.680 --> 54:41.480
And then I'll get in there, and I'll be like, piss,

54:41.480 --> 54:43.440
and just say the potty words for him

54:43.440 --> 54:44.880
is a new thing that I'm doing.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.680
So if you want, I can do that.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.520
Do you do parties too, Griffin?

54:49.520 --> 54:51.800
Like you just show up, and you do Owen Wilson.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.040
Yeah, I show up to kids' parties,

54:53.040 --> 54:56.760
and I say the words piss and bastard and ass and shit.

54:56.760 --> 54:59.000
Just like Owen Wilson would say them.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
But I say them in Owen Wilson's voice,

55:01.000 --> 55:02.680
and I don't dress up or anything.

55:02.680 --> 55:04.960
I just look like me, but I roll up,

55:04.960 --> 55:07.940
and then the 10-year-olds are like, do piss again.

55:07.940 --> 55:09.280
And I'll be like, piss.

55:09.280 --> 55:12.380
It's so good.

55:12.380 --> 55:14.240
I've never heard Owen Wilson say that word,

55:14.240 --> 55:16.120
so I don't know how accurate it is, but it's-

55:16.120 --> 55:17.960
Hey, that's not like Santa Travis with the toilet word,

55:17.960 --> 55:18.800
and he hates these words.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.960
But it sounds like I would imagine

55:20.960 --> 55:22.900
he would sound saying it.

55:22.900 --> 55:24.240
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.320
You're welcome.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.120
I've spent $30,000 on these lessons,

55:27.120 --> 55:28.320
so it sounds really good. It's paid off, it's worth it.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.900
You're gonna make that back just on the circuit.

55:30.900 --> 55:33.320
I wanted to say, I wanted to end this episode

55:33.320 --> 55:36.380
with something that I want to talk about real quick,

55:36.380 --> 55:38.980
because I was looking at other Owen Wilson movies,

55:38.980 --> 55:40.920
trying to see if there might be some funny,

55:40.920 --> 55:43.840
funny bat catalog stuff that I could pull out.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.040
I'd forgotten he was an Armageddon.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.200
I was like, wait, Owen Wilson's an Armageddon?

55:48.200 --> 55:49.960
Yeah, he gets got, I think, pretty quick.

55:49.960 --> 55:54.960
So I clicked through, just I guess a closing meditation.

55:56.920 --> 55:59.360
The character names in the movie Armageddon

55:59.360 --> 56:01.120
are fucking buck wild.

56:01.120 --> 56:02.900
Oh, give me some of them.

56:02.900 --> 56:07.800
Okay, so Bruce Willis plays Harry S. Stamper.

56:07.800 --> 56:11.920
Okay, by itself, that may not be very buck wild.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.680
Billy Bob Thornton, Dan Truman.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.640
Okay, still all right.

56:16.640 --> 56:19.120
Ben Affleck plays A.J. Frost.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.000
Ooh, all right.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.100
Will Patton plays Charles Chick Chappell.

56:25.100 --> 56:27.640
Steve Buscemi's name is Rock Hound.

56:27.640 --> 56:28.480
Okay.

56:28.480 --> 56:31.800
He's the Transformer.

56:31.800 --> 56:34.760
Michael Clark Duncan recipes his,

56:34.760 --> 56:37.560
he is J. Otis Bear Curlene.

56:37.560 --> 56:38.720
Bear is his nickname.

56:38.720 --> 56:41.400
J. Otis Curlene, nickname Bear.

56:41.400 --> 56:45.360
And Owen Wilson, his character's name is Oscar Choice.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.920
It actually isn't.

56:46.920 --> 56:49.760
It actually, that doesn't, that's not a name.

56:49.760 --> 56:53.180
That was his long con to try to win an Oscar.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.760
Yeah, but they chose to, they were like,

56:54.760 --> 56:56.080
thank you for the choice, Owen.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.040
We're gonna pass on this one, I think.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.560
Our answer is no to the choice.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.840
Folks, that's gonna do it for us.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.280
Thank you so much for listening.

57:04.280 --> 57:06.600
We very much appreciate you.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.440
I wanted to give one quick plug.

57:08.440 --> 57:11.560
You know you can watch our TV show on VRV.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.160
That's VRV.co.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.980
My brother, my brother and me, the show is there.

57:14.980 --> 57:17.480
You can watch all six episodes plus all the extra stuff.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.540
While you're there, you can check out a new show

57:19.540 --> 57:22.120
that I was on.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.680
It's called Slug Riot.

57:23.680 --> 57:25.800
It's an animated series.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.520
I play a character named Very Deadward.

57:28.520 --> 57:33.200
He's the bassist of this moldcore band called Slug Riot.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.600
And it's a, there's only one episode up so far.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.560
But it was really fun to do.

57:38.560 --> 57:42.040
And the, oh, it looks like the two and three are up too.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.240
So you can go watch those too.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.560
VRV.co, I believe they're free.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.740
Or at least the first one is to watch.

57:47.740 --> 57:50.560
But Slug Riot is the name of the show.

57:50.560 --> 57:51.720
And it was really fun to make.

57:51.720 --> 57:53.440
And the episode is just like three minutes long.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.360
So go check that out, cause it was really fun.

57:55.360 --> 57:58.160
I wanna do just a couple quick plugs.

57:58.160 --> 58:02.280
One, this, I think it's Thursday, the 25th,

58:02.280 --> 58:04.840
I'm gonna be at the John Hondren and Jean Grey show,

58:04.840 --> 58:09.200
the John and Jean show at the Bell House that night.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.040
You can get tickets to that at bit.ly forward slash

58:12.040 --> 58:15.480
Travis, J and J, and that's in Brooklyn, New York.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.160
And before the show, I will be hanging out

58:17.160 --> 58:18.000
at the Hinterlands.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.200
So if you wanna come say hi there, grab a drink,

58:22.200 --> 58:25.920
help support Stuart Wellington and co,

58:25.920 --> 58:28.680
come do that and then come over to the show.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.360
I also wanna say, speaking of John and Jean,

58:31.360 --> 58:35.480
so Hal Loveland and I have a charity fundraising podcast

58:35.480 --> 58:36.560
called Surprisingly Nice.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.200
And it's been a while since we put an episode out,

58:38.200 --> 58:41.400
but we just recorded a new one with John Hondren

58:41.400 --> 58:43.400
and then special guest Jean Grey shows up.

58:43.400 --> 58:45.120
And we've changed our funding model,

58:45.120 --> 58:47.240
but basically how it is, is we're raising money.

58:47.240 --> 58:49.960
We set a goal for $500 for this first episode.

58:49.960 --> 58:52.280
And when we hit that, we will publish the episode.

58:52.280 --> 58:55.120
And that money goes to World Central Kitchen,

58:55.120 --> 58:59.480
which is a food charity that makes meals.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.320
Specifically right now,

59:00.320 --> 59:03.760
they're working to provide meals for Puerto Rico.

59:03.760 --> 59:05.880
And Hondren has said that on top of that,

59:05.880 --> 59:08.040
every dollar raised for World Central Kitchen,

59:08.040 --> 59:10.600
he will match that and donate to Planned Parenthood

59:10.600 --> 59:13.640
because that was the second choice for a charity.

59:13.640 --> 59:17.400
So every dollar you donate is going to actually benefit

59:17.400 --> 59:18.760
two different charities.

59:18.760 --> 59:25.360
You can donate at paypal.me.surprisinglynice.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.600
So far, we've already raised about $250

59:27.600 --> 59:29.120
in just like three days.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.160
So I think we're gonna-

59:30.160 --> 59:31.000
That's awesome.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.120
Yeah, I think we're gonna hit that $500

59:32.120 --> 59:34.040
and you can help with that.

59:34.040 --> 59:35.960
Isn't the JoCo Cruise also coming up soon?

59:35.960 --> 59:37.200
Yeah, JoCo Cruise.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.600
I'm not gonna be mentioning it much longer

59:38.600 --> 59:40.880
because it's in like three weeks,

59:40.880 --> 59:43.120
but I'm getting really, really amped for it.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.120
It's gonna be a super fun time

59:45.120 --> 59:46.680
and I'm really looking forward to it.

59:46.680 --> 59:51.480
And you can find out about that at JoCoCruise.com.

59:51.480 --> 59:54.480
And one more kind of a coming soon,

59:54.480 --> 59:56.680
I'm putting together a show here in Cincinnati

59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.040
that I'm calling the Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.360
And it is a secret show in that I'm not going to announce

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.320
who the guests are ahead of time,

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.560
but for this first show,

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.520
I've already got five people coming

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.600
and it's going to be a really good time.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.240
So tickets are going to be coming soon for that.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.560
And I have made a website for that

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.640
that I'm going to look up right now.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.680
Can I ask if you call it

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.440
the Cincinnati Underground Secret Society,

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.520
which is a little bit redundant,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.080
just so the acronym can be CUS?

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:25.920
Yes, absolutely.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.240
It's the Cincinnati Underground Society

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.880
and this is the Cincinnati Underground Society Show.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.040
And yes, the website I am currently working on

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.840
is cus.live.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.760
And so that is where I'll be putting up.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.480
It's right now, there is literally nothing to the website,

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.120
but it is on Squarespace.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.240
But that is where I will post ticket links and stuff.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.160
And hopefully I will have that up soon.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.320
And then our first show is going to be March 30th

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.440
here in Cincinnati.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.680
And then my hope is to make it a monthly show

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.120
with different guests every time

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.120
and like secret society pins and that kind of thing.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.800
It's going to be a real fun time,

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.360
but more information about that will be coming soon.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.240
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.120
for the use of our theme song

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.960
and to departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.360
It's a fantastic album that you should get

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.640
if you don't already have it.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.360

all of our stuff is also at McRoyShows.com.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.760
Do you guys want that final?

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.480
Yeah.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.600
It was sent in by Leslie.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.440
Thank you, Leslie.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.040
It's Yahoo Answers user FawziB asks,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.080
can Jello steal my energy if I am an Aquarius?

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.040
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.840
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.000
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.960
Hey girls, do you wanna just say, hey I wanna?

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.000
Maximumfun.org.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.320
Comedy and culture, artist owned, listener supported.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.200
Hi there, I'm film critic April Wolf

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.720
and host of the Maximum Fun podcast Switchblade Sisters.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.360
Do you love genre films?

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.160
Do you love female filmmakers?

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.800
Do you love discussions on craft?

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.760
If your answer is yes, you'll love Switchblade Sisters.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.440
Every episode I invite one female filmmaker on

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.080
and we talk in depth about their fave genre film

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.840
and how it influenced their own work.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.240
So we're talking horror, action, sci-fi, fantasy,

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.080
bizarro and exploitation cinema.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.880
Mothers, lock up your sons

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.440
cause the Switchblade Sisters are coming for you.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.480
