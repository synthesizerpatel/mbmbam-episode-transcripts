WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:50.060
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:10.100 --> 01:16.540
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother and me if I show for the modern era, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:16.540 --> 01:22.620
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm Griffin. Hey guys. Hey guys. Hey guys

01:24.020 --> 01:25.900
Remember when we were kids?

01:25.900 --> 01:27.900
Yeah, and Publishers Clearinghouse

01:28.340 --> 01:33.260
Like people would win, you know, like a million dollars to get a big check who delivered those checks

01:33.900 --> 01:39.420
What who delivered those checks on Publishers Clearinghouse? Yeah, and McMahon

01:39.820 --> 01:42.740
Ed McMahon never worked for Publishers Clearinghouse

01:42.740 --> 01:49.780
And like I just found this out seconds before we started recording that it's just like a huge Mandela effect

01:49.780 --> 01:54.340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-hmm. No, it's Ed McMahon from Publishers Clearinghouse

01:54.340 --> 02:00.520
It was not Ed McMahon Justin Ed McMahon briefly worked for a competitor called America's Publishing House

02:01.460 --> 02:03.700
But never worked for Publishers Clearinghouse

02:03.700 --> 02:10.140
Even though in there like clips from TV shows where the people on the TV shows were like it was Ed McMahon

02:10.140 --> 02:16.820
He just called I've won the Publishers Clearinghouse. Are you fucking with me? I am NOT fucking with you. Justin. Is it okay?

02:16.820 --> 02:21.900
I remember remembering now and first of all, most of our young listeners are 12

02:22.220 --> 02:29.060
And so they used to just come to people's doors with a big check and then like some balloons for some reason

02:30.460 --> 02:34.400
Yeah, like if they came to my door like hey, you're a millionaire and here's some balloons

02:34.400 --> 02:38.660
I would the balloons would not even I would not clock those the balloons for the kids

02:38.660 --> 02:41.940
this is Mandela effect like the Berenstain Bears and

02:43.460 --> 02:49.860
All the all of I can't think of another for some reason people there are some people who think Sinbad was in the Kazam movie

02:50.700 --> 02:56.500
And it was called Shazam or something and it's like no that was Shaq, but I don't that one's never that one

02:56.500 --> 02:58.460
I don't subscribe to cuz I'm not dumb dumb

02:58.460 --> 03:00.460
But anyway, they used to just come to your door and give you money

03:00.460 --> 03:03.060
I don't think you had to put your name in

03:03.260 --> 03:05.820
Sometimes Ed McMahon would just roll up to your house and be like here's a boy

03:05.820 --> 03:11.780
But it wasn't a man is actually Vince McMahon and he would show up and be like you got some money for you

03:11.780 --> 03:17.900
and then when you took the check it's stone-cold Steve Austin would come and he would punch the check in half and you punch your

03:17.900 --> 03:23.100
Neck in half and then and then he would get in your house and he would just take whatever he wanted. Oh Griffin

03:23.100 --> 03:25.620
I'm sorry. I actually just looked at it wasn't Vince McMahon

03:25.620 --> 03:28.540
It was Vince Vaughn and he would show up with Jon Favreau

03:29.140 --> 03:34.100
And they would say like your money baby. Yeah, you got so much money and you don't even know it

03:34.100 --> 03:37.780
Yeah, but there's a lot of like wrestling jokes we could make if we did go with my one

03:37.780 --> 03:41.820
I know but I can keep going with the swingers thing if you want, but actually, you know

03:41.820 --> 03:45.660
What people thought that Vince McMahon was funnier. So that's like a Mandela effect, too

03:45.660 --> 03:52.820
Oh my god, they're so weird. And you know how people used to think that Cheerios were called yummios

03:53.300 --> 03:57.420
That's a Mandela. That's a Mandela effect. This shit freaks me out

03:57.700 --> 04:00.340
It freaks me out too. It also freaks me out

04:00.340 --> 04:05.980
I think it's kind of bullshit that like we're just now discovering that Nelson Mandela

04:06.820 --> 04:10.800
acted like he was doing all sorts of good stuff, but really he was like

04:11.660 --> 04:14.720
He's just a dirty dog all your memories

04:15.220 --> 04:19.380
Fucking everything up. Well, yeah, he built that alternate universe switcheroo machine

04:20.100 --> 04:23.860
Yeah, and then it's like this. Do you guys know about the thing in Star Wars?

04:25.180 --> 04:27.180
Go on the line

04:27.180 --> 04:32.540
Groom been groomed been grim in Star Wars. It's like it's clobbering time

04:32.540 --> 04:36.660
Yeah, that's right up the he actually never said that he said it's clubbering time

04:36.980 --> 04:41.460
That's the little thing the Darth Vader part where you think he says

04:42.100 --> 04:49.200
Luke I am your father spoiler really but really the real line that he says it's lightsaber time bitch. Yeah

04:49.200 --> 04:58.080
Yeah, I didn't know that I don't like repeating that I don't say that word like ever but it's but he that is what he

04:58.080 --> 05:03.860
He looks up at him. He's like my father's not like you and then Darth Vader is like, whatever whatever

05:06.840 --> 05:12.200
Yeah, a lot of people there's a lot from Star Wars that people forget about like

05:12.200 --> 05:18.200
Yeah, the one scene where a lot of you will think Obi-Wan Kenobi says like this lightsaber belong to your father

05:18.200 --> 05:22.080
Yeah, he says it saves time dingus. Yeah

05:22.720 --> 05:26.120
Stands next to Luke and there is rewatch it tonight

05:26.680 --> 05:31.360
There's a 10-minute sequence with where Luke is like trying to find the on switch

05:31.680 --> 05:38.080
Yeah, Obi-Wan Kenobi's just like blaze it blaze it. Yeah, he's that shit and blaze it blaze it

05:38.080 --> 05:40.080
And then there's a part where Jabba

05:40.880 --> 05:42.720
penis

05:42.720 --> 05:49.840
Is McClunky please his McClunky is just like out. Yeah, and but and you see and you think about that

05:49.840 --> 05:53.920
You're like that can't be real Mandela effect and it's funny what our brains can do

05:53.920 --> 05:56.280
Yeah, cuz Han keeps tripping on the penis

05:56.600 --> 06:01.160
He does trips on it and he falls in the starlac mouth and dies and a lot of people get that to a lot of people

06:01.160 --> 06:05.720
Don't remember that. Do you remember in Casablanca? He never says played against them

06:06.160 --> 06:10.840
It's just doing Sam started. He yells. That's my fucking jam. Yeah

06:10.840 --> 06:15.720
Hey play my joint Sam. I think the line is he just goes up to Sam. He's like Sam

06:16.880 --> 06:23.560
Please play it for daddy, but we think that's so stupid. So I'm going to like, you know, it'd be a way more

06:23.560 --> 06:30.980
Hey, what's up Griffin? It's me Nelson Mandela inside your brain, you know, it'd be a more badass line and he twists it up on me

06:31.120 --> 06:34.600
Yeah, the actual line he says doesn't amount to hello beans

06:34.600 --> 06:41.240
Which sucks cuz I fucking love beans and like people always cut off that last part in their brains

06:41.360 --> 06:43.360
Cuz they forget about that long

06:43.640 --> 06:46.640
Really long sequence of him just eating a bunch of beans

06:47.480 --> 06:51.960
A lot of people think a lot of people do think Justin go ahead. No you go ahead

06:51.960 --> 06:56.280
No, I was following I was trying to like enhance yours. No, please go ahead

06:56.560 --> 06:58.560
Well, I was gonna be a pivot out

06:58.560 --> 07:04.800
So if you've got a chunky one, go ahead and let it fly which is the classic line from Sandlot

07:04.800 --> 07:06.800
Yeah that James Earl Jones

07:07.440 --> 07:12.480
He's taunting the kids from over the fence. He's picking up over the fence. Like will it Wilson is

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
Have you got a chunk you on let it fly

07:17.520 --> 07:22.320
He's actually standing on the other side of the glove and has been for the past few months

07:22.520 --> 07:26.720
He's the one they crank one. A lot of people remember the dog catching it in his mouth

07:26.720 --> 07:29.960
It was James Earl Jones caught it in his mouth and in gone with the wind

07:29.960 --> 07:34.240
Everybody thinks guys my witness. I'll never go hungry again. But really what happens is the wind

07:34.920 --> 07:39.600
Blows all the food out of the yes, and she said I got the monkeys like a motherfucker

07:39.800 --> 07:45.700
Yeah, and then they they don't have any more food cuz it's gone with the wind and so she's like get back here with the

07:45.700 --> 07:48.000
Wind but then they go to subway. Yeah

07:48.800 --> 07:53.280
And you know how everybody thinks eat fresh was the subway line. Well, that one's that one's right

07:53.280 --> 07:56.600
Oh, sometimes your brain's not playing tricks on you

07:57.320 --> 08:03.880
That's when it's the weirdest a lot of people think that this used to be an advice show that we actually did advice

08:03.880 --> 08:09.280
No, when show point to win point to win send me a clip of win. We did this

08:11.280 --> 08:12.960
I'll wait I

08:12.960 --> 08:16.040
Couldn't find it. I did it. Yeah, but I couldn't couldn't find anything

08:16.600 --> 08:20.160
Let's start. Let's turn it over a new leaf and try to hang people

08:20.160 --> 08:24.360
This is an advice show if you have an actual advice query that we could help you with

08:25.120 --> 08:31.460
Mb mb am at maximum fun.org is our email address. It's important. We give that out every four years or so

08:31.460 --> 08:36.840
Yeah, cuz we I don't know. I bet we see an influx. You're just sitting around you're like, hey

08:36.840 --> 08:43.520
I got it. I need some help and we'll help you. It's not a problem. I don't mind. I like doing it

08:43.520 --> 08:45.040
I like doing it

08:45.040 --> 08:50.000
Contrary to the evidence of the past few hundred episodes. I like doing it. I do like doing it

08:50.000 --> 08:53.360
My favorite Korean sandwich place gives out punch cards

08:53.920 --> 08:59.080
For every ten items purchased you get a free sandwich. I've been collecting full punch cards for years

08:59.080 --> 09:02.600
Some have been gifts when I even found on the street nice

09:02.600 --> 09:06.320
I'm leaving town soon and I want to claim my free sandwiches as soon as possible

09:06.320 --> 09:10.680
But I'm scared of being recognized as having received a free sub the day before

09:11.280 --> 09:17.640
What do I do if that happens? I have about six parts left. That's from nervous sandwich eater in, Nebraska

09:17.640 --> 09:23.680
I mean you got to roll in and get all your sandwiches at once. Yeah, you do this every if you come in for a free

09:24.640 --> 09:29.460
Sando every day, they're gonna get pretty annoyed and pioed with you

09:29.960 --> 09:32.920
Come in once and you're like seven sandals, please

09:33.480 --> 09:40.180
Then it's always over and done with us. We need to hey, we need to as a society

09:40.840 --> 09:46.040
Start thinking more about whether or not employees are paid commission or not

09:46.040 --> 09:51.120
And I think that that will lighten up a lot of these concerns for you five o'clock

09:51.120 --> 09:57.760
They're going home no matter if you take all the bread and feed it to ducks outside right and then walk out

09:57.760 --> 10:02.000
They're going home at five this person at this good. They're getting paid the same amount

10:02.720 --> 10:05.480
Almost certainly and and here's the thing

10:05.480 --> 10:11.480
It's not like you've conned the system these punch card the punches only come when you buy a sandwich

10:11.480 --> 10:17.520
So they knew when they established this punch card deal. They knew what they were getting into that

10:17.520 --> 10:23.760
They were like, yeah ten. We are charging ten percent more than we should per sandwich. You bought it

10:23.760 --> 10:25.760
You already bought those sandals. That's what I

10:27.880 --> 10:31.400
It's been paid for you gotta give it gotta give credit though

10:31.400 --> 10:35.640
I I can never keep track of a punch card long enough to fill it out

10:35.640 --> 10:38.560
I don't actually understand why you didn't redeem

10:38.560 --> 10:42.640
You know, that's true because you buy enough sandwiches

10:43.280 --> 10:47.840
To refill those which means you could have used some of those

10:48.400 --> 10:54.000
To get free the sandwiches you paid for to get the punches on the card. Yeah, why didn't you redeem it?

10:54.000 --> 10:59.680
You should have redeemed it. Were you saving it for like I'm gonna I need to feel like I've

11:00.200 --> 11:06.920
Really achieved something today. Today's a free sandwich day, right that when they're like, that'll be I don't know like $8

11:06.920 --> 11:12.640
And you're like, no it won't and it's just like I need to know that the universe is on my side for this one today

11:15.320 --> 11:20.960
Get those sandwiches nobody cares nobody there. It cares. Nobody there is gonna get mad at you. This is you're overthinking it

11:21.560 --> 11:25.400
Go get those sandals and eat them all in one sitting in front of them

11:25.400 --> 11:27.000
You're overthinking it by the way

11:27.000 --> 11:30.080
We need to be careful because we could put ourselves out of business

11:30.080 --> 11:36.920
By just having that each episode is now five minutes long because we can answer 75% of questions with you're overthinking it

11:37.040 --> 11:42.640
You're thinking it just like, you know, go get some sandwiches. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what to say

11:42.640 --> 11:46.400
I mean, why didn't you redeem them? You could invest in some no

11:46.760 --> 11:50.600
Why didn't you redeem them? You should have done this so long when you fill one up

11:51.480 --> 11:52.880
you

11:52.880 --> 11:56.680
You're hooked on the sense of achievement. You gotta let yourself

11:56.680 --> 12:04.120
Luxuriate your spoils you worked hard for those ten punches. Go get your free sandwich. There's nothing more delicious

12:04.920 --> 12:07.680
except a little pepperoncini unless I

12:09.760 --> 12:12.760
Don't know Trav, I don't know. Okay, here's Trav

12:12.760 --> 12:16.240
I don't I don't want to break ten years of tradition, but I don't unless

12:16.680 --> 12:18.680
you're gonna get five friends and

12:18.920 --> 12:21.960
You're all gonna go in and each one is one by one gonna get the sandwich

12:21.960 --> 12:28.280
Right, and then what you're all gonna step outside and then they're gonna hand the other five sandwiches to you now

12:28.280 --> 12:33.720
It is important because this is the prestige the employees need to see this happen and they're like, oh

12:34.280 --> 12:36.120
They got us

12:36.120 --> 12:40.760
We fell for the oldest trick in the book. Well cuz now it feels like you tell me now how that's better

12:41.560 --> 12:47.200
Because now it's a it's a bit now and it's a thing and you think that's people working at quiz nose one is

12:47.800 --> 12:49.400
Korean quiz

12:49.400 --> 12:55.660
when a sketch everybody likes to feel like they were part of something I guess so and then

12:56.560 --> 13:01.440
Garcia Andy Garcia joins in in like the third one, you know what I mean?

13:01.440 --> 13:05.760
Like he wants to be part of it too. Actually Travis it that doesn't happen to oceans

13:07.080 --> 13:13.840
Andy Garcia is not even in them. Holy shit. It's cherry. It's cherry Garcia his sister Carlos Mincy. Oh

13:13.840 --> 13:21.080
Oh Carlos would see a place the bad guy in all of the oceans movies, but it's not the same character

13:21.080 --> 13:26.480
Oh, really? Yeah, Carlos Mencia plays different bad guy characters throughout it. So

13:27.360 --> 13:29.360
Can I do a wizard?

13:29.560 --> 13:34.040
Can you I guess I'm gonna do a wizard now Ben can't sent this one in. Thank you

13:34.040 --> 13:39.000
Ben crushing it has always it is how to win and I love you more argument. Oh, thank God

13:39.000 --> 13:44.380

It turns out that there are a ton of ways. You just have to get creative here

13:56.100 --> 13:59.900
We'll share some sweet and sassy comebacks that will make your SO admit defeat

Articles finally acknowledging the truth, which is the love is a competition

14:09.440 --> 14:13.460
Yeah, as our things all as a battlefield, but that's a different thing

14:14.000 --> 14:18.360
And a flower a rose with thorns. That's so true Griffin

14:19.160 --> 14:26.160
Okay, so I number one. I love you the most dazzle them with a word. That's even better than more a child wrote this one

It's a special love my love for you who's exceeded maximum recommended settings. Yeah, I'm terrified

15:04.400 --> 15:10.960

For how much I love fuck cuz I got a bad case of love in you like the song says but mine's serious cuz I could

15:23.000 --> 15:26.660
Give me the news and then also doctor. I've got a bad case of loving you

15:27.320 --> 15:32.240
So it seems like he knows the news. He has his diagnosis. Yeah, that's this that's the score

15:32.240 --> 15:39.320
But his this kind of WebMD like he just like googled it and the doctors probably got you're like the third dude today. I

15:39.960 --> 15:47.120
Think about you day and night say you're totally smitten to be 100% victorious. Here's some suggestions even after all this time

15:47.120 --> 15:51.040
I'm absolutely obsessed with you. You're on my mind 24-7. I totally adore you

15:51.040 --> 15:53.880
I'm head over heels for you every second of the day

15:54.560 --> 15:57.180
Some of these are starting to send a little bit

15:57.840 --> 16:04.160
less of a I love you more competition and more something one might find in the journal of

16:04.480 --> 16:10.240
Someone that needs some help like you know, I mean like a killing guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

16:10.240 --> 16:15.560
Yeah, I think about you day and night. I'm so obsessed with you. I like even after all this time

16:15.560 --> 16:17.480
I'm absolutely obsessed with you

16:17.480 --> 16:22.040
Acknowledging that times ravages should have reduced my love for you at this point

16:22.040 --> 16:27.600
Even though I know all the horrible shit about you and how terrible you are like 40% of the time

16:27.600 --> 16:31.160
I'm still pretty obsessed with you. I frequently forget to eat poop and sleep

16:31.960 --> 16:34.720
Because of the way where the commas go in there Griffin. I

16:39.000 --> 16:44.080
Gross I love you to the moon and back declare your loves out of this world to win your silly fight

16:44.080 --> 16:48.820
Tell them that there's nothing on earth that compared to how you feel about them. You'll make them swim with your adoring words

16:49.740 --> 16:54.500
Suggestions you're my moon and stars. You're the Sun in my life. My love for you is out of this world

16:55.140 --> 16:58.380
When you say you're my moon and stars, what does that mean?

16:58.620 --> 17:05.900
Because it's not like on a normal basis you the moon and stars are so very important to every individual

17:05.900 --> 17:13.700
That my love for you has replaced your love for the moon and stars. No, I think it's saying quite literally and

17:13.980 --> 17:19.540
It's stupid because you know what my moon and stars is the moon and stars. Yeah, there's they're great

17:20.020 --> 17:26.660
Yeah, they're up there every night doing it. I'm just saying that there's a way you could say like you're my bread

17:27.180 --> 17:32.660
Right. I love bread. You're the blood in my body and I do need that

17:32.660 --> 17:38.940
I don't know that I love my blood though. I'm saying like I'm making an optional choice. Okay, your blood is great

17:38.940 --> 17:40.940
I got amazing blood

17:41.140 --> 17:44.740
But if I say like I love you more than I love

17:45.260 --> 17:48.540
detective plus weird consultant procedural shows and

17:49.060 --> 17:52.780
That's a lot means something that means something

17:53.740 --> 17:58.780
You're gonna be here's where we really start to get into it. You're gonna be my number one for an eternity

17:58.780 --> 18:04.380
Eternity tell them you'll always be their biggest fan to win them over bring up words like eternity forever or endless

18:04.380 --> 18:08.660
It'll be unmistakable that you'll always be there for your SO. I don't want a fan

18:08.660 --> 18:15.100
I place you above everything else. I worship you. You will always come first. Your happiness is my biggest priority, babe

18:15.300 --> 18:18.100
Gross, babe, babe forever, babe

18:18.540 --> 18:20.260
We'll never die

18:20.260 --> 18:27.580
Hey shit that like 15 year old Travis said because he thought it was romantic. This is gross, but it's getting there, isn't it?

18:27.580 --> 18:30.540
You try this out you think about this Mandela effect

18:30.540 --> 18:36.140
Your brain is like that sucks, but really is good if Teresa said to me. I'm your biggest fan

18:36.700 --> 18:43.740
Forever that is eternity for eternity for an endless forever. No. Thank you. I will Travis Travis. Hey real quick

18:43.740 --> 18:47.240
I worship you. I worship you eternally. Well, I appreciate that guys

18:48.340 --> 18:54.580
Definitely uneven as far as our yolks go. I place you above everything else Travis forever and for eternity

18:54.580 --> 18:57.900
That is putting a lot of pressure on me as your brother, but I really appreciate it

18:57.900 --> 19:00.540
And I also know frankly I can rise to that challenge

19:01.660 --> 19:05.020
If I had to choose, but I'm not married to you guys here

19:05.020 --> 19:07.240
Let me try this next one if I had to choose the best part of my life

19:07.240 --> 19:09.920
It'd be you kissy face emoji con. Well, you're right about that

19:10.340 --> 19:16.220
They say they're say they're a gift so they'll melt and admit defeat say that just their presence is the highlight of their life

19:16.340 --> 19:17.620
What?

19:17.620 --> 19:21.700
Your presence is the highlight of your life. That's great. That's actually pretty meaningful

19:21.700 --> 19:27.340
I can I just say this whoever was written this article also does not know how to win and I love you more

19:27.500 --> 19:33.520
Competition because the way that you win I would argue is for your partner to be the one who loves you more like I love

19:33.520 --> 19:35.520
you more

19:36.940 --> 19:43.140
If you love the other person more you've lost right? Yeah, so if they're like, I love you. I love you more good

19:44.060 --> 19:47.660
Wow, I appreciate that. That's great. That's great for me. Yes

19:47.660 --> 19:53.020
Check me. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I don't love you as much as you love me, but I'm over here

19:53.020 --> 19:57.340
But I'm about by loving it. Yeah, I appreciate hey awesome

19:57.860 --> 20:02.180
Cuz I know how much I love you. Yeah, and if you're more than that fuck

20:02.180 --> 20:07.620
Yeah, dude, or you could get really but her about it just back. Wow. I thought I love you the most but fuck me

20:07.620 --> 20:12.540
I guess yeah, I guess I'm the asshole because I'm the real big butthole. I got proof. I love you more

20:12.540 --> 20:17.740
I bought you a ps5 be over the top and give them a gift to come out on top in your quote-unquote fight

20:17.740 --> 20:20.980
This is a great call for a special milestone like their birthday or an anniversary

20:21.340 --> 20:24.580
Use a thoughtful gift as evidence for how much you adore them

20:24.580 --> 20:27.060
Now you do you have to sit on that gift for a while?

20:27.060 --> 20:32.400
You're like I have the okay. I've bought the ps5 now to get into an I love you more. I love you

20:32.400 --> 20:37.300
I love you, too. Fuck damn fuck. Damn it. Are you sure you don't how much?

20:37.300 --> 20:43.500
What how much do you love me what he why why are you asking you that?

20:44.100 --> 20:50.500
Quantify it fight me. Just compare it to my love for you. Come on. It'll be fun

20:50.500 --> 20:54.860
I don't want to do that. I love you. I love you, too. What are you fucking afraid of?

20:55.660 --> 20:58.440
Challenge me, but come on put yourself out there

20:59.320 --> 21:03.160
Here's some suggestions. It's obvious. I love you more. Just check out the package on your doorstep

21:03.160 --> 21:07.740
I think these concert tickets show. I love you more. I blow I blow your love out of the park

21:07.740 --> 21:10.300
I booked us a trip to Maui. I like wow

21:11.140 --> 21:15.580
The tents in that one sounds a lot like they're doing a little bit of roleplay

21:16.540 --> 21:21.000
Like oh, yeah. Well my love I blow your love out of the park. I cast

21:22.980 --> 21:24.900
Trip to Maui

21:24.900 --> 21:31.020
It's a critical. I wish I've been there when this kid was like, what do you what do people where's a romantic place?

21:31.020 --> 21:33.380
I'm a we I guess

21:34.700 --> 21:37.700
That sounds a little bit like whilst in the middle of the argument

21:37.700 --> 21:41.460
I've pulled up like Expedia or something on my phone and it's like oh, yeah

21:41.460 --> 21:46.100
I just but it's like you booked us a trip without talking to me for it. Like how much did you spend?

21:46.100 --> 21:51.020
I'm busy that week. What if I was busy? I can't go don't get mad cuz I played my trap card

21:51.060 --> 21:54.020
We're going to Maui you lose good day, man

21:54.500 --> 21:59.340
You lose all the dictionaries in the world wouldn't have enough words to describe my love

21:59.340 --> 22:01.900
If you're left speechless say words can't express all your love

22:01.900 --> 22:04.500
Let them know that there's no way you could tell them how much you love them

22:04.500 --> 22:09.020
Even if you had all the phrases for love at your fingertips, if you're with each other in person

22:09.020 --> 22:11.020
Give your SO a hug to really seal the deal

22:11.540 --> 22:17.900
I love you flubity blubity. Yeah, I run out of breath if I listed all the ways I love you

22:18.220 --> 22:22.420
So what you want me to die Sheila? Come on, that's very selfish of you

22:23.220 --> 22:28.040
All the books come on it take more than a lifetime to share everything. I love about you

22:28.040 --> 22:31.980
So do not ask me to because we will both be dead at the end of it

22:32.980 --> 22:37.760
A trillion. Here's another one a trillion poems couldn't capture how much I love you

22:38.260 --> 22:41.020
You really use impressive numbers like

22:42.020 --> 22:44.660
100 a million or a

22:45.100 --> 22:51.140
Thousand to express that you can't qualify all your love. Do they know that those three are not in order of size a

22:52.100 --> 22:54.980
Hundred poems couldn't capture how much I love you. That's not

22:54.980 --> 23:00.540
Really that impressive. There's a grip of poems out there. Also almost certainly not true

23:00.940 --> 23:06.060
Right, like this is that when you get into that like all these poems couldn't express how much I love you

23:06.060 --> 23:11.740
It's like I don't know me. I'm like one you haven't even tried good poems

23:11.780 --> 23:16.540
Like there's a lot of poems even that if it was just like roses are red violets are blue

23:17.140 --> 23:22.060
You're really great. Like I okay cool. Yeah, nice man. Like I love you a lot

23:22.060 --> 23:26.860
That's all you're expressing this whole time. Like you're not rewriting anything

23:26.980 --> 23:27.500
Yeah

23:27.500 --> 23:32.740
And a lot of poems and a lot of people don't know this but I'm married to a poet and she has taught me a lot

23:32.740 --> 23:38.300
about this stuff is that some poems aren't even about loving someone and some of them are about like

23:38.780 --> 23:43.740
Like a big strong baseball player and get this they don't even have to rhyme

23:43.820 --> 23:47.700
Which I think is absolute horseshit cuz that's just a story at that point, right?

23:47.700 --> 23:52.740
But a bad story where I didn't fill in all the details. I just said a bunch of phrases together and you're like

23:52.740 --> 23:58.460
Oh the imagery like yeah, but like how tall was he? We don't know. Yeah, I didn't put it in the story, right?

23:58.740 --> 24:02.140
Yeah, you know, I was actually I was referencing Casey at the bat there

24:02.140 --> 24:06.820
But then I forgot that at the end he does strike out. So like he's what spoilers

24:06.860 --> 24:12.380
He's not actually Star Wars and Casey at the bat. He's not a good baseball players. I'm saying he's a big strong idiot

24:12.380 --> 24:13.740
Well, hold on fuck you Griffin

24:13.740 --> 24:19.620
Even the best baseball player doesn't have like a one-point like batting average everybody misses sometimes

24:19.620 --> 24:25.580
This was an important homer for him. So he's not clutch. He can't handle the pressure doesn't mean he's not a good baseball player

24:25.580 --> 24:29.540
I'd like to see you try Casey's up there every day at the bat putting the work in

24:29.820 --> 24:35.380
Yeah, and here you are doing it. Are we finally are we finally talking about Casey? Yeah, man

24:35.740 --> 24:40.460
Okay, we've been putting it off for a decade, but let's fucking get this dude

24:40.460 --> 24:47.020
Why? Okay, the poem is about a guy that tries to hit baseball

24:47.900 --> 24:54.820
It's so hard. And it's so important that he hits it. Oh my god. It's so important. They really need him to hit it

24:54.820 --> 25:00.460
Yeah, it's like and he swings his great power and he misses. Only on the third one though

25:00.460 --> 25:05.980
The first two he lets go by and says not my style and like I didn't want to hit it. What an asshole

25:05.980 --> 25:10.920
right, and then he chunks it and he doesn't do it and like

25:12.140 --> 25:15.820
everyone this is how things went in the 1900s or

25:17.740 --> 25:19.740
Late 1880s

25:20.180 --> 25:23.580
Then he did it and everybody's like fuck. Yeah

25:24.100 --> 25:28.380
This is my favorite poem ever. Yeah, I'm gonna keep

25:29.100 --> 25:31.100
Bringing this up

25:31.100 --> 25:35.620
Go to my friends and be like guys. I just read the fucking cool

25:35.620 --> 25:37.140
It's oh

25:37.140 --> 25:42.980
It's about a guy who doesn't swing at a baseball a couple times and then he does and misses and bums

25:43.140 --> 25:46.820
Everybody out and I think it's the best poem I've ever read

25:46.940 --> 25:52.340
Yeah, someone must have I think it's Melville right but somebody must have gone to him been like hey one note

25:52.340 --> 25:57.880
Great poem and love the poem all the baseball stuff. Love it one note. What if he hit it at the end?

25:57.880 --> 26:02.400
What if he hit it at the end and the last line was like and he cranked it

26:03.240 --> 26:06.520
Everybody was so jazzed and they went and had a great afternoon

26:06.520 --> 26:13.360
No, it's Ernest Thayer and it's like what if even the other team's fans were like Casey did a great job. Damn Casey

26:13.640 --> 26:16.080
Okay, he swings at the first pitch two notes

26:16.080 --> 26:19.840
He swings at the first pitch and totally nails it and everyone's like, oh, thank god

26:19.840 --> 26:24.520
And then if you want maybe it's not like a walk-off from him and you can change it be like he hits it

26:24.520 --> 26:31.000
They're up by two. It's on base. He gets on base or something. And then the next guy strikes and then Jamison comes to bat

26:31.040 --> 26:33.880
Yeah, call it Jamison at the bat. Let's see

26:33.880 --> 26:41.200
we call it the name of the poem is now Jamison cranks that shit after Casey puts up an impotent single and

26:41.760 --> 26:46.600
Maybe Jamison really cranks it but what's this? Oh the player will call him

26:47.640 --> 26:52.740
We'll call him doing doing just like really leaps in the air like a nine-foot leap

26:52.740 --> 26:57.560
It's tremendous catches it out of the air. Yeah, right. So now it's like oh everybody did a great job

26:57.880 --> 27:01.860
Everybody did a great job doing especially swimming in tush. Oh

27:02.520 --> 27:08.000
Yeah, there could be four or five more stanzas and that's like and then yeah, maybe they go into overtime

27:08.000 --> 27:14.480
They're tied. Oh and the game never ends. Yeah, everybody's swimming in tush by the end everyone's swimming

27:14.480 --> 27:16.480
That's the only way they can get him to stop playing

27:16.480 --> 27:23.100
They just call it and you can have all the tush you want. There are two different towns in America

27:23.280 --> 27:28.500
That claim to be the real mud. Why would you want to be that loser-ass town sucks?

27:28.500 --> 27:31.360
Why do you want to be this beat down shitty town?

27:31.480 --> 27:39.000
Yeah, where the biggest thing you got going is a dude lost at baseball and got no tush. That's us. We're the tush less town

27:39.920 --> 27:43.760
Alright, we're the ones where it happened or didn't happen

27:43.760 --> 27:46.260
You could give up and respond

27:46.260 --> 27:51.940
I know in the argument by soaking up your SO's love get a little cocky and say you're already totally aware

27:51.940 --> 27:56.820
They adore you. It's a great way to stop them in their tracks and make them laugh suggestions. Tell me something

27:56.820 --> 28:03.660
I don't know. Okay, sounds good to me. How could you not shrug emoji? Wow. I love you more. You're right. I'm sorry

28:05.220 --> 28:08.940
I'm trying to love you more, but I've just never known how to

28:08.940 --> 28:13.040
I'm the Casey at the battle of love

28:13.140 --> 28:18.960
I'm trying to swing away and I keep missing and this won't for sure get you broke up with let's just agree

28:18.960 --> 28:21.580
We love each other equally. You're not really arguing

28:21.580 --> 28:27.100
The truth is truce is still pretty cute remind them that love doesn't have to be a battlefield even though

28:27.580 --> 28:29.760
We have spent the last 10 tips

28:30.660 --> 28:36.200
Demanding that love be a battlefield focus on what really matters your feelings for each other and celebrate that you're both completely in love

28:36.200 --> 28:41.480
Suggestions, why don't we call it even we're both a hundred percent in love. I don't want to argue. Let's just call it true

28:41.480 --> 28:46.120
Good. How are you love? I think we should call it a day and just cuddle. I'm not gonna I love you

28:46.120 --> 28:51.320
I love you more. Don't do this. Don't do this. Let's stop and cuddle. I'm not gonna cuddle with you. You're fucking weak

28:51.400 --> 28:53.700
We're driving a good thing to say. Yeah

28:54.540 --> 28:58.180
Okay, come on. No, I'm driving cuddle me if you love me now

28:58.180 --> 29:02.560
If you love me, you'll let go the way you don't cuddle me right now means I love you the most and I will be

29:02.560 --> 29:07.880
Consistently dissatisfied with the level of love that you're giving me. That's the subtext of this whole thing

29:08.680 --> 29:10.680
That's all don't do any of this

29:11.240 --> 29:16.680
Don't do any of this. No, don't do it. No, I love you in a different way. Oh, that's cool

29:16.680 --> 29:19.880
I love you. You may love me more in the way that you love me

29:20.080 --> 29:24.040
But I love you in a very special way like the way a dog loves a person all this

29:24.040 --> 29:30.000
Okay, this is great when when your partner says I love you more you say like are we talking like per?

29:30.000 --> 29:36.840
Pounds it's a ratio thing or is it just like right? We're just doing one for one love comparison

29:36.840 --> 29:43.920
Let's really break this down because I'm about four inches taller than you right? So I would say my love per square inch

29:44.360 --> 29:46.680
Yeah, it might be lower than yours

29:47.080 --> 29:52.280
But still my overall number and by this point they've left the room. They've left you

29:52.600 --> 29:57.880
Yeah, you say I've got 60 pounds on you and that's pure love muscle and I'm not my wiener when I say that

29:57.880 --> 30:01.560
I mean the if you got a 60-pound wiener, oh my god

30:03.080 --> 30:08.460
That's my favorite stanza and Casey at the bat where it takes like actually it's like two or three stanzas that talks about like

30:09.240 --> 30:11.800
Every dimension of Casey's wiener. Yeah

30:12.440 --> 30:14.360
where it's like

30:14.360 --> 30:15.880
He's like

30:15.880 --> 30:20.200
Now the leather-bound sphere comes hurtling through the air and did you check out?

30:20.960 --> 30:22.840
This dude's hog

30:22.840 --> 30:29.080
massive hog they keep having to redraw the baselines because as Casey goes from base to base his

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
normal member just

30:31.960 --> 30:33.960
Dusts it away

30:34.040 --> 30:40.880
It's not just like a physical thickness. It's got a lot of emotional depth as well. It reads to kids

30:42.520 --> 30:49.680
Everything this is one incredible wiener its symbolic weight can actually be measured by physical scales

30:49.680 --> 30:55.800
That's how important this wiener. It's amazing. And maybe he can't close the deal when he needs to

30:59.640 --> 31:07.460
His automobile has a special sidecar for his thing for that dirty thing that damn dirty thing Casey's got

31:09.600 --> 31:13.740
That's it for this article I feel like we did a good job with it. Yeah

31:13.740 --> 31:20.640

Yeah, completely our silly show is 15 years old

I'm Lori Kilgarten. We're a bunch of stand-up comics and we've been doing comedy like 60 years total

But let's not help him too much

37:17.060 --> 37:23.180
No, I'm yeah for sure. I don't want to make ourselves obsolete. You know, you know, yeah one unrealistic expectation

37:23.180 --> 37:27.740
Thank you abilities. I'm at the bar and I need to order a beer

37:28.260 --> 37:32.380
Be do eat. Boom. There you go. Easy. Oh wait, they're in America

37:33.300 --> 37:35.300
Fucking guy

37:35.300 --> 37:39.700
I'm ordering a beer to celebrate getting my reports done, but he's distracted

37:40.220 --> 37:42.300
Okay, I'm at the bar and I need that

37:42.300 --> 37:47.060
I don't know who the he is referring to probably the person that was yeah that one you might order a

37:47.300 --> 37:52.540
Drink from I'm at the bar and I need to order a beer to celebrate getting my reports done

37:52.820 --> 37:56.620
But the bartender is distracted watching Austin Powers and seems really into it

37:56.620 --> 37:59.860
Am I legally allowed to interrupt his bliss and not be able to do anything?

37:59.860 --> 38:05.860
I'm at the bar and I need to order a beer to celebrate getting my reports done, but the bartender is distracted watching Austin Powers and seems really into it

38:05.860 --> 38:08.860
Am I legally allowed to interrupt his bliss and order another

38:09.860 --> 38:15.860
That's from chillaxing in Chapel Hill now. I want to talk to you for a second about an interesting

38:15.860 --> 38:20.260
Little thing you've done with your pros here. You made it sound at the beginning

38:20.860 --> 38:22.860
Like you're ready to begin drinking beers

38:23.460 --> 38:28.460
It sounds by the end of the question like you're settling in for another beer

38:28.460 --> 38:33.460
Which one is have you already been enjoying beers Justin or are you a new arrival here?

38:33.460 --> 38:36.940
You got that because I feel like it changes the tenor of your relationship with the bartender

38:36.940 --> 38:43.220
I would say that if you walk in it sounds to me like the first beer was a motivation

38:43.740 --> 38:48.100
To work on the reports, right? This is my root. This is my co-worker now

38:48.100 --> 38:48.780
well

38:48.780 --> 38:55.540
this is a team effort between me and my friend beer and now I finished the reports and now it's time for a

38:55.540 --> 38:59.380
Reward beer which will be perhaps higher gravity

39:01.100 --> 39:03.900
Perhaps now I'm gonna go for a goza. You know what I mean?

39:03.900 --> 39:10.600
I was having a lager before a gozer a gozer. Yeah goes are the goes Aryan indeed

39:10.980 --> 39:16.980
Drink that spooky beer up. I'm gonna I'm gonna let him take over my body and use me as the gatekeeper now

39:17.300 --> 39:20.380
Here's the thing so erotic. I

39:20.380 --> 39:26.820
Also would guarantee I've been to a bar that that's all right. It didn't need to be said it's fine

39:26.820 --> 39:30.500
But I'm thinking it I thought it would be funny, but I don't think it's actually that good

39:30.500 --> 39:32.500
It goes there gets in your body and

39:32.780 --> 39:37.020
Uses you as a vessel. Okay. Well, we all have our feelings about it Griffin

39:37.020 --> 39:39.860
You've made yours clear that when you walked in you got your beer

39:39.860 --> 39:45.460
The bartender said it kind of get you anything else and then you said no and that bartender then

39:45.860 --> 39:49.060
Said to themselves cool back to Austin Powers

39:49.060 --> 39:50.140
mmm

39:50.140 --> 39:54.740
Now it's your turn to re-establish the connection because you said you didn't want anything else

39:55.540 --> 39:57.660
Here's my suggestion. What do you guys think about this?

39:58.340 --> 40:04.660
You're going to laugh maybe a little too hard at the next justifiable joke that one might laugh at

40:04.860 --> 40:06.860
Yeah, you're gonna break

40:07.540 --> 40:11.180
Until they look at you're like, oh laughing this hard sure makes me thirsty

40:11.180 --> 40:17.980
Thirsty. Okay, that's great. That's great. I like Travis. That's actually a good one. Just like

40:19.460 --> 40:23.180
He's proven next to Tom Arnold, that's hysterical good

40:23.900 --> 40:27.660
Why I got your attention over here. I would love a

40:28.220 --> 40:34.500
Big bottle of wine. Yeah, or whatever, you know, whatever you should or if you can get a word in edgewise

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
You should just order

40:36.500 --> 40:41.140
Eight or nine beers so that you don't have to get them lined up. Maybe a flight

40:42.460 --> 40:49.620
Yeah flight of big beers because I mean you can say like oh I'll get one during the funny poop scene with Tom Arnold

40:49.900 --> 40:51.300
but then like

40:51.300 --> 40:55.220
You're not gonna really have a big window there because the next joke is just gonna come

40:55.980 --> 40:57.980
fast and furious right after and

40:58.260 --> 41:05.540
Either okay either the bartender is watching on DVD, which is a possibility I guess or way more likely it's on TBS

41:05.540 --> 41:07.540
At which point there will be?

41:07.620 --> 41:10.580
Commercial breaks, right? I mean I guess like

41:11.140 --> 41:13.140
Who wants to wait for that?

41:13.180 --> 41:18.040
Tabs on Austin Powers long enough. No, that's the bartender's job is to keep tabs. Yeah

41:18.980 --> 41:22.420
Thank you. God Austin Powers is fucking funny. It's so good

41:22.420 --> 41:24.420
I wish I was watching that instead of this

41:24.420 --> 41:30.220
And I get it man cuz you look away from that for two minutes you're lost in the plot. Yeah, it's going too fast

41:30.220 --> 41:33.860
yeah, it's really doing a balance of like comedy and

41:33.860 --> 41:37.740
Action and there's so much character work that you're like wait

41:37.740 --> 41:39.460
Why does he care about this now?

41:39.460 --> 41:44.580
If this was the love guru you would have plenty of windows to get in there and get the beverage that you need

41:44.580 --> 41:47.100
Yeah, there's some link not that it's not funny

41:47.100 --> 41:51.780
But that it's they give their jokes a little bit more room to breathe in the love guru

41:52.100 --> 41:54.700
Yeah, they don't let you they don't let you get up

41:57.140 --> 42:01.260
It's it's it's funny cuz it's like they said didn't how I married an expert

42:01.260 --> 42:05.180
It's like we're gonna have some jokes, but mostly we're gonna have like a real story here

42:05.180 --> 42:07.260
But you really have to follow and then you got to awesome powers

42:07.260 --> 42:10.800
They're like, you know what we can focus a little bit more on the jokes all the jokes and they're like, you know

42:10.800 --> 42:16.040
Why too many jokes love guru? We're just gonna have a few jokes. What about story? No

42:16.420 --> 42:19.760
No, if so, I mean love gurus got good story in it. Does it Griffin?

42:20.060 --> 42:26.100
Yeah, and and also speaking of the bent average. Did you know that it is a spin-off of?

42:26.100 --> 42:31.780
So married an axe right dead. Yeah, I just can't get enough of that fact in the loosest

42:32.340 --> 42:38.900
Sense in the loosest sense Mike Myers you whatever you think about the quality of the pentaverte

42:38.900 --> 42:40.900
Which is a wild and unassailable

42:41.780 --> 42:46.540
It is wild that Mike Myers did a called shot of late. Do you realize?

42:47.300 --> 42:51.060
Mike Myers laid the mythology out of the pentaverte in

42:51.060 --> 42:58.820
So I married an axe murder wrote the check put it in a Bible put the Bible on a shelf came back 25 years later

42:59.060 --> 43:02.940
Opens the Bible. What's this? Oh, that's right. That definitely makes the Bible

43:02.940 --> 43:10.500
definitely forgot about the Bible and then and then makes the bent average based on the mythology he established and so I made an axe murder

43:12.060 --> 43:14.060
unfathomable unfathomable

43:14.700 --> 43:15.540
Justin I'm sorry

43:15.540 --> 43:21.620
Isn't it more likely that someone maybe Ed McMahon showed up from that Netflix with a giant check and said but we do need you

43:21.620 --> 43:23.620
To give us this an idea right now

43:24.060 --> 43:24.500
Yeah

43:24.500 --> 43:29.460
And he just finished rewatching his own movie because that's what I would do if I was Mike Myers and I'd made so many

43:29.540 --> 43:35.020
Classics God knows I've watched my own TV show. Also. I wish there was I wish the rumor episodes

43:35.020 --> 43:41.580
Just so I had more to watch. Yeah, whatever again, man. We're fucking funny, but then he was like not funny enough or too funny

43:42.820 --> 43:44.820
possible

43:44.820 --> 43:47.580
Pint ever it and they're like sold Mike

43:48.460 --> 43:50.420
So Mike, thanks

43:50.420 --> 43:52.420
Here's your big check. I'm Ed McMahon. Oh

43:54.060 --> 43:58.780
Sorry, I've recently taking up salsa dancing lessons and it's going really well

43:59.140 --> 44:04.060
The only problem is I get very sweaty when doing even the slightest amount of extra. Yes, me too

44:04.060 --> 44:09.740
It makes it particularly awkward when my dance partner has to touch my sweaty self. Plus it doesn't look too graceful

44:09.740 --> 44:15.580
How can I sweat less or at least sweat with style on the dance floor? That's from sizzling salsa boy in Sydney

44:15.580 --> 44:19.940
I mean, I wish I glistened right the sweat the sweat is perfect

44:19.940 --> 44:24.660
It's part of it part of it, but it shouldn't be all of it Justin. It's all of it. It's sensuality

44:25.820 --> 44:27.660
No, but this is the thing justice

44:27.660 --> 44:32.580
There's a difference between him that glistening sheen of sweat right which is what we all strive for all the time

44:33.260 --> 44:36.100
Versus that just like oh is it hot in here like that?

44:36.100 --> 44:43.480
I I did two hours of yard work this weekend and like you would have think I was thrown into a pool by a big

44:43.480 --> 44:48.060
Bully, I I call it work glitter because it's when I'm putting in the work

44:48.060 --> 44:48.500
Yes

44:48.500 --> 44:48.980
You know what?

44:48.980 --> 44:52.400
I mean when I'm putting in the work and I start to glisten with

44:52.700 --> 44:56.140
Possibility of a renewed me that feels better and has more confidence

44:56.780 --> 45:02.660
Like that's my that that I treasure that sweat. I treasure it and for this the

45:02.660 --> 45:08.860
The the sweat is just the sexuality oozing out of all dances sex all sexes dance

45:08.860 --> 45:10.860
This is thank you. This is my theory

45:11.780 --> 45:13.780
That lay it out

45:13.780 --> 45:16.700
You can't think he just said it. No, he said the whole theory

45:16.700 --> 45:21.060
I believe all sexes dance and all dances sex sexes dance salsa dance

45:21.060 --> 45:24.300
Especially the wetter the better people will know

45:24.740 --> 45:31.500
Leave no doubt in their mind when they see how wet you are on that salsa dance floor. So okay ice dancing. That's ice sex

45:31.500 --> 45:34.040
Yes, you're saying yeah, but you don't get that wet

45:34.740 --> 45:37.660
What about the cha-cha? Oh fuck. Yeah, that's sex man

45:38.980 --> 45:40.980
Is a sort of prescribed sex

45:42.140 --> 45:45.880
It's like wait, you guys don't have a caller during your sexual

45:47.060 --> 45:51.840
Exploits. Yeah, who's like no glide to the left and I would be like, that's

45:52.980 --> 45:55.440
Direction possible right now. I decide move

45:56.060 --> 45:58.860
To the left. I'll try it. Whoa, you were right

45:58.860 --> 46:02.600
Whoa, that's why you hired me man. Now follow along

46:03.580 --> 46:05.580

Great. Cha-cha real smooth. I do I don't

46:10.380 --> 46:12.380
How I'll try it

46:12.740 --> 46:14.740
Whoa

46:15.620 --> 46:22.140
What about like shaker style dancing that's very like does it give to be sit that kind of I don't think they do a lot

46:22.140 --> 46:27.660
Of dancing in there Justin unless you like I guess they're shaking. Well, they move around a chair. There's a they move around a chair

46:27.660 --> 46:32.020
Oh, no, Griffin, you're thinking of the fuck

46:36.260 --> 46:39.100
Musical chairs is what I was trying to get to just wasn't there

46:39.660 --> 46:41.060
I

46:41.060 --> 46:44.860
remember doing a chair based choreography in elementary school to

46:45.420 --> 46:47.420
Tis a gift to be simple

46:47.740 --> 46:52.140
And think the whole time thinking like this is deeply deeply

46:53.180 --> 46:55.180
erotic I

46:55.180 --> 46:57.180
I

46:57.300 --> 47:01.660
Think anybody who salsa dances and doesn't sweat is a cyber is a cyber person

47:02.260 --> 47:07.700
Yeah, that is and that's fine. You should be able to express your cyber feelings through the art of dance

47:07.700 --> 47:10.260
But you can't beat yourself up if you're not sweating. Yeah, and

47:10.940 --> 47:15.940
You know what next time you're dancing with that partner and they feel that sheen of sweat on you

47:15.940 --> 47:20.540
You just you don't have to say that loud because don't be that person but you can think like you're welcome

47:20.540 --> 47:25.620
I'm in it, right? I'm in it. I'm here. You see my commitment. It's easy. Thank you

47:25.620 --> 47:27.700
It's a good sign. You ain't phoned it in right?

47:27.700 --> 47:33.180
Like I'm literally giving it all I've got if I gave any more I might pass out and every every dry

47:33.300 --> 47:38.700
Dave in that fucking dance for it by looking at you the whole time like I wish I could get that wet

47:38.700 --> 47:44.340
Oh, so who's to say you got to do this salsa dancing in like a big fancy suit or whatever you're wearing

47:44.340 --> 47:48.340
You're getting so warm. Maybe some shorts and nothing else man

47:48.340 --> 47:54.780
I'm that's I'm imagining them in the big talking head suit. Just yeah dancing and just like just just so

47:55.460 --> 48:00.220
Damp all over inside also just don't drink a lot of water for the 48 hours beforehand

48:00.220 --> 48:05.620
So that way you don't have any you don't have any water to sweat baby. This is bad advice. You'll die

48:05.620 --> 48:11.280
No, you can't do that. I mean there's other liquids you can try the one thing I won't joke about on this show is hydration

48:11.280 --> 48:14.340
Yeah, that's true. You're you know, you're right. I'm so sorry, but I didn't mean it

48:14.340 --> 48:18.380
Drink water all the water you drink. Don't pee until you get on the floor. I

48:18.940 --> 48:23.380
Thought that in silver linings playbook. They were both in they were both so dry

48:24.420 --> 48:29.340
At the big scene in the em, we're like time to win the dance contest and they do win it but they're dry

48:29.340 --> 48:33.700
This is our third one that we have ruined you must stop

48:34.060 --> 48:38.580
Hey, you ruined Star Wars Casey at the bat silver linings playbook

48:38.580 --> 48:44.160
We you know, it does this fucking right dirty dancing at the end when he's doing

48:45.420 --> 48:50.780
Sweaty as hell and that's such a good work. That's the call it sweaty dancing dirt is the man

48:50.780 --> 48:55.580
What you see that room and you're like that man brought the humid in with him. I

48:58.660 --> 49:03.300
Think that a lot of people get yearbook quotes from this show and that's fine

49:03.300 --> 49:09.620
And if you do want to use the dirt is the man wet for that to let people do

49:09.700 --> 49:13.060
Yeah, your help yourself and your principal's gonna call you and be like

49:13.980 --> 49:16.700
What's this me? I'm not saying you leave out

49:17.660 --> 49:23.140
Letters, is there conjunction that should be in there? What's happening be like you obviously don't know how to dance

49:23.980 --> 49:29.500
Yeah, man, and he's like, oh, yeah, and then challenges you right then and there but he's gonna be so dry

49:29.500 --> 49:35.020
Cuz he doesn't fucking know if he knew he would know what the dirt is the man wet means Kevin Bacon's bringing the man wet

49:35.020 --> 49:40.060
Too. Yeah, Kevin Bacon bring and I'm not just talking about footloose. He brings it in tremors to

49:40.660 --> 49:44.780
Lesser-known dancing movie, but that's just the climate. Yeah. Well, no

49:45.340 --> 49:47.940
Climate it was the being afraid of big worms

49:48.140 --> 49:54.600
That makes that that man wet also he would be terrified of Casey at the bat. It's not the it's just the tremors

49:54.600 --> 49:57.060
He's afraid it's not the heat. It's the monster. Yeah, that's true

49:57.060 --> 49:58.940
Foo-foo-foo

49:58.940 --> 50:05.780
Do we want to do another if we've been really zooming through these I love these I've never done all the I want to do

50:05.780 --> 50:11.500
No, let's do it a while back. I was a member of a fan forum for a show we get it

50:11.500 --> 50:16.900
Yeah, okay, you don't have to play coy with us. You used to like our show enough to be on a fan

50:16.900 --> 50:21.500
I don't think that's it. Keep going. The rest of this question might rule us out. Who knows though?

50:21.500 --> 50:25.640
I was chatting with the other forum members about how much I love the beautiful dark green

50:25.640 --> 50:27.640
iridescent suit that one of the

50:28.220 --> 50:30.220
every recording

50:30.220 --> 50:31.940
That they went out of the blue

50:31.940 --> 50:36.860
One of the other members of the forum offered to give me an identical waistcoat from their closet that they need to get rid of

50:38.340 --> 50:41.340
At the time I declined because I didn't know them very well

50:41.340 --> 50:46.900
But now I'm starting to get into wearing gothic style clothes and that waistcoat is really looking really tempting

50:46.980 --> 50:49.580
The only problem is it's been over years since they offered

50:49.580 --> 50:54.760
Should I reach out to them see if they still have it or have I waited too long and lost my chance at having a sick

50:54.760 --> 51:00.300
Ass beetle vest. Okay, so that changes it at the end there, doesn't it? Because I'm my I would not describe

51:01.140 --> 51:06.540
I would not describe my dark green iridescent suit that I wear every recording as a beetle vest. Oh

51:07.600 --> 51:13.220
Travis I feel like you've got the highest likelihood of knowing what this person is different. I'm trying to pull it, right?

51:13.220 --> 51:17.420
I'm thinking it's big bad beetle borgs. I mean can't be that

51:18.940 --> 51:21.500
Wait, were you listing things you wanted to rule out?

51:21.500 --> 51:23.500
No

51:23.500 --> 51:25.580
Tell me why it can't be big bad beetle borgs

51:25.980 --> 51:29.940
If I'm writing into my brother my brother me and I have a question that I I'm gonna take to them

51:29.940 --> 51:30.120
Yeah

51:30.120 --> 51:35.940
And I do have a way of and I want to make sure this and this gets answered and I have the ability to tie it

51:35.940 --> 51:38.060
into big bad beetle borgs and thereby

51:38.700 --> 51:43.620
Guarantee, yes my participation in the program. I'm going and that's like we don't can't be big

51:43.620 --> 51:45.780
We don't do roommate questions or anything anymore

51:45.780 --> 51:49.660
But if somebody was like my fucking roommate stole my stole my potato chips again

51:49.660 --> 51:55.140
How do I make sure he doesn't steal my potato chips also big bad beetle borgs then guess what?

51:55.140 --> 51:57.140
You're we are going to get into it

51:57.500 --> 52:02.220
But please don't listen don't this is now we've said it the rule it's gone

52:02.220 --> 52:05.420
But that that has been the truth for a long time. So it's I

52:06.140 --> 52:08.860
Can't help with your question, but I can't help with the mystery

52:08.860 --> 52:13.500
I love the dark green iridescent suit that one of the characters

52:13.500 --> 52:18.140
Uh-huh, and it's a beetle vest. Well, it might not be an actual beetle

52:18.140 --> 52:22.940
It might just be like iridescent and similar to a Beatles carapace

52:23.100 --> 52:27.700
But they said that the person offered them a way who I bet I bet it's arrow

52:29.780 --> 52:31.780
Arrow I bet it's arrow

52:32.340 --> 52:37.820
Arrow have a waistcoat. Oh, I got a look now, but when I'm thinking dark green iridescent

52:38.740 --> 52:40.260
arrow beetles

52:40.260 --> 52:42.260
loves beetles

52:42.260 --> 52:48.180
Arrow character suit very you guys know. Hey Griffin. What's a waistcoat? It's a western

52:48.740 --> 52:52.460
Shit Travis shut up Griffin. What's a waistcoat? It's like what pirates wears. Yes

52:53.900 --> 52:56.500
Griffin what's a waistcoat? Just describe a waistcoat for me

52:56.500 --> 53:03.700
It's a coat that cinches around the waist and it's what's a pirate wears. Does it got sleeves? Yeah, it's a coat

53:03.700 --> 53:08.760
Oh my god. No, it's a vest. It's a vest a waistcoat. Well, then they should fucking call it that

53:08.760 --> 53:13.360
Did you know I just learned this like just I was fun

53:13.360 --> 53:17.440
So me and Justin were both dum-dums, but Justin educated himself and then thought he would turn

53:17.960 --> 53:22.440
No, no. No, I just want to see I'm admitting to my ignorance. I'm not like I'm not

53:22.440 --> 53:27.140
I you didn't you didn't let me quiz you so let me quiz you on some shit that both of us don't know

53:27.140 --> 53:29.140
But I'm gonna Google real quick

53:30.240 --> 53:32.160
You guys didn't know

53:32.160 --> 53:34.040

53:34.040 --> 53:41.140
You know, what's funny is the capital of Arkansas and a lot of people thought and Justin. What do you real quick?

53:41.140 --> 53:43.140
What do you think the capital of Arkansas is?

53:44.600 --> 53:46.600

53:47.960 --> 53:53.680

I mean you wouldn't order that you just need it in a vest just need arrow

54:25.380 --> 54:32.780
green vest here is this as green now he said, okay, but wait if they said is a vest that one of the characters wears

54:33.140 --> 54:38.300
That tells me that it's like a uniform. This is their costume, right? It's not just like

54:39.500 --> 54:44.300
They don't say sometimes where they say all the times where it's all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

54:44.460 --> 54:48.500
Okay, and it's gotta be sure the fan form beautiful target. See that's what's making me thing

54:48.500 --> 54:56.020
Yeah, nobody cares. Nobody gives a shit about arrow. That is not true. Griffin. I've never made buddy who's like love

54:56.220 --> 54:59.620
You gotta be watching then you need to get your fucking shit together, bro

55:00.460 --> 55:07.060
At the first comic-con I ever went to I thought I would be trampled until dead by air by real arrowheads

55:07.300 --> 55:09.300
Yes, that is what we call ourselves

55:09.340 --> 55:15.020
Somebody yelled some I was chilling and I was like looking at Pokemon cards and somebody's like so fucking arrow

55:15.020 --> 55:18.700
And then all of it was like a herd of wildebeest

55:19.100 --> 55:25.500
Gotha style set upon me. It might if it's a gothic style. You're a distant green vest. It might be

55:26.340 --> 55:30.500
Arrow. Something supernatural, but I don't I don't I can't picture it

55:31.140 --> 55:33.420
Okay. Hmm. Does anybody on

55:34.500 --> 55:41.220
Riverdale wear vests. Don't watch Riverdale. It doesn't have a you don't have to watch Riverdale to Google Riverdale vest

55:41.220 --> 55:48.580
I'm just I want you to know if it's not detective plus weird consultant. I don't watch it Justin

55:49.220 --> 55:51.220
if it's not Lucifer or

55:51.540 --> 55:58.100
Numbers or mentalist or monk or psych or lie to me. I found it. What is it?

55:58.100 --> 56:00.100
What is it? Jughead wears the power vest

56:01.260 --> 56:03.820
Jughead wears a power vest. Jughead wears the power vest

56:04.540 --> 56:06.540
Jug like Jughead vest

56:06.540 --> 56:11.260
Jughead wears the power vest when they are like doing when they're like trying to find out who the criminal is. Jug

56:13.460 --> 56:15.460
Head, where's the power Justin?

56:17.940 --> 56:22.820
Please tell me you know the weird shit that happens in that TV show. It's off the rails

56:23.100 --> 56:28.940
It's what I have said was clearly a joke, but also like wilder shit hath happened

56:28.940 --> 56:34.740
Um, yeah, but Jughead Jughead does have the power vest and that's what he wears to go fast. I

56:40.340 --> 56:42.580
Love that bit when he's like gotta go fast

56:44.860 --> 56:49.740
And he zooms away and everyone's like whoa and then he zooms back cuz he forgot all of his cheeseburgers I

56:50.700 --> 56:57.860
Googled characters who wear vests. That was a mistake that was I'm looking at now. It's a lad in it said

56:57.860 --> 57:04.340
Jughead and in parentheses power vest wearer and then arrow so it's one of those three

57:06.460 --> 57:13.400
Yeah, there's a lot of vests in popular culture really yeah interesting like

57:14.540 --> 57:17.900
Wait a minute. Is it the from is it?

57:19.020 --> 57:20.740
somebody from Naruto

57:20.740 --> 57:22.380
Naruto wear a vest

57:22.380 --> 57:25.980
the waist cut this is what's problematic about this is that

57:25.980 --> 57:28.940
Well one it's not entertaining. But the second thing is that

57:30.500 --> 57:33.100
Maybe it's outlander seems like people are whoa

57:33.700 --> 57:41.300
Outlander, it's probably outlander. In fact, let's just assume it's let's just call it for outlander. Oh, yeah

57:41.980 --> 57:46.500
Joker it's gotta be joke then what's the what's the TV show Justin?

57:47.140 --> 57:49.140
Joker's wild

57:50.500 --> 57:52.300
Yeah, you got me

57:52.300 --> 57:59.580
Yeah, you know what there was that crossover event outlander big bad beetleborgs

57:59.980 --> 58:03.900
Where they travel back in time and they're like you want a shag, baby

58:03.900 --> 58:05.820
And then she's like, yeah

58:05.820 --> 58:12.140
But then the big bad beetleborgs show up with their crazy genie ghost and I remember that you better not that was basically

58:12.980 --> 58:14.420
Jay Leno

58:14.420 --> 58:16.940
Yeah, thank you. Yeah. I mean everybody knows that yeah

58:16.940 --> 58:21.820
But I guess it is important if you don't know that that the genie was Jay Leno to know that they hate sex

58:21.820 --> 58:25.140
And so they show up time travel. They go back in time. They say you better not

58:25.180 --> 58:31.140
It is weird how much they brought up abstinence on that show and not just like premarital as it is just like forever

58:31.460 --> 58:34.500
Yeah, the biggest baddest beagle beagle Borg is

58:35.500 --> 58:40.860
Abstinence that's where the beetleborgs power came from. Yes the the cages around their genitals

58:41.860 --> 58:43.860
Yeah, man for sure. Definitely

58:43.860 --> 58:49.500
That was rarely talked about except on the fan forums, oh

58:49.940 --> 58:52.420
What about the boys the boys?

58:53.580 --> 59:00.660
Wait a minute. No, wait, it's got to be the boys or Loki. Oh, I bet it's Loki. It's got to be Loki

59:01.140 --> 59:06.560
It's got to be low because the boys if you're talking about the Aquaman, dude, the Aquaman

59:06.560 --> 59:11.600
I wouldn't call that a waste. That's not very gothic though, but Loki for sure

59:12.240 --> 59:15.440
Loki. All right. Hey gosh, I love this

59:15.800 --> 59:22.480
They would have said Loki. This is clearly something they're deeply ashamed of the same. Yeah, there is shame there. We like Loki

59:23.240 --> 59:25.240
We hate beetleborgs

59:26.440 --> 59:30.220
Don't even email us about the beetleborgs. We hate those abstinent freaks

59:32.720 --> 59:34.720
Please write in

59:34.720 --> 59:36.720
That wasn't what the vest is from so we could die

59:39.920 --> 59:41.880
Justin you're saying Loki

59:41.880 --> 59:48.000
Travis no, I want to say the boys. I'm gonna say the boys. I'm saying Loki. Loki feels right. Okay

59:48.560 --> 59:50.480
I'm gonna say

59:50.480 --> 59:52.280
Oh, but wait a minute

59:52.280 --> 59:55.400
The clue of gothic style. Yeah. Yeah
