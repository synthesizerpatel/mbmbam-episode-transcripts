00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:51.440
Welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, where we've just finished our yearly viewing

00:52.400 --> 00:59.440
of the VMAs. We all gathered together. Hands up, hands up, meta question. Who actually watched

00:59.440 --> 01:07.760
them? Because I missed out. I watched Lady Gaga's performance, which was haunting,

01:08.560 --> 01:14.080
and then I watched her second one that she did with Robin Thicke, and god, she is a chameleon.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.960
You could barely even detect that that was her. She was blending into his suit.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.800
Did you know that everyone in the audience is Lady Gaga? They did it with computers.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.760
Actually, I heard a rumor that that first part was true, but that it wasn't computers.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.760
She just did it? She's amazing. She just fucking did it. She's the first mutant.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.720
The gene is making itself known. God, we were going to talk about Miley Cyrus,

01:40.720 --> 01:44.640
like this is all anyways fucking talking about. I'm going to hit it from a different angle.

01:45.520 --> 01:52.560
She was an embarrassment to furries. Yeah. Miley Cyrus was? Yes. Was she wearing a fursuit? She

01:52.560 --> 01:58.000
was convinced that it was about furry. She was in a fucking like had mouse ears on and like

01:58.000 --> 02:03.600
was wearing like a mouse bathing suit and everybody was in these weird like almost like

02:03.600 --> 02:08.480
those teddy bear plastic toys you get out of like a gumball machine. We should mention Griffin has

02:08.480 --> 02:12.560
been in Germany for the past week where that kind of thing is completely normal. Can I say something

02:12.560 --> 02:16.480
without I imagine we have German listeners. I don't want people to think I'm xenophobic because

02:16.480 --> 02:22.320
I genuinely do love traveling to Germany. This is this is my second time doing it for work,

02:22.320 --> 02:27.760
but the hotel we were staying at had a TV station that was literally 24 hours Nazi documentary,

02:27.760 --> 02:37.120
like a like an old timey like like a like a TV news special on on the whole Nazi thing.

02:37.120 --> 02:42.080
And they showed it like literally like around the clock. Every time we ate dinner at the hotel,

02:42.080 --> 02:47.680
they had the TV turned to that station. And it's like, guys, this is worse than the Miley Cyrus

02:47.680 --> 02:52.640
shit. And that was really bad. I'm not saying that what the things that the Nazis did were worse,

02:52.640 --> 02:57.760
but the documentary, the documentary, why are you dredging that shit up? Move on.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.920
You've got lots of stuff going for you now. You bail out every country. Yep. You made the

03:03.920 --> 03:09.440
new Beatle, which is fantastic. You're not Russia. You're not Russia. Look at that. That's pretty

03:09.440 --> 03:14.800
great. Hello, Germany. And we're here to help you. I'm sorry. Morgan thing funny about the

03:14.800 --> 03:19.280
Miley. Watch that Miley Cyrus video, I think, is what it's like for most people listening to

03:19.280 --> 03:23.520
my brother. My brother and me, there's adults walking around with giant teddy bears on their

03:23.520 --> 03:28.160
back. And it's like, yeah, life feels like that sometimes. Listen, that only thing that makes

03:28.160 --> 03:32.480
that whole thing worthwhile is every time it cuts to the audience, like you either see like

03:32.480 --> 03:40.160
screaming fans or like other like actual musical professionals who just look horrified. I'm gonna

03:40.160 --> 03:46.960
say this. Okay. I'm gonna let you guys finish. I'm gonna say this, though. Just let the fucking

03:46.960 --> 03:54.320
girl twerk. Let the girl do her goddamn thing. The fucking news people who are making this a big deal

03:54.320 --> 03:59.040
are pitching it from the angle of look at what Hannah Montana turned out to be. And it's like,

03:59.040 --> 04:03.840
guess what? Everybody fucking grows up. You're the one that's looking at this 20-year-old woman

04:03.840 --> 04:07.920
slapping her butt cheeks together in a way that's supposed to be sexually provocative and being

04:07.920 --> 04:13.360
like, I wonder what a 12-year-old doing that would look like. You fucking perverts. If you're

04:13.360 --> 04:16.960
sharing that link, if you're dropping that link on your Facebook wall, guess what? You're a pervert,

04:16.960 --> 04:23.200
too. I'm the only non-pervert in the room saying this is a 20-year-old woman trying to be sexually

04:23.200 --> 04:27.280
provocative by slapping her butt cheeks together like you would your hands after a good theater

04:27.280 --> 04:35.280
performance. I cannot tell if you're in favor or against it. I'm neutral on the thing, but what I'm

04:35.280 --> 04:40.720
against are people like, that used to be, that's somebody's daughter. Yeah, guess what? So is every

04:40.720 --> 04:47.520
stripper. Right about that, CNN. CNN does not do enough stripper-based programming. No, but they

04:47.520 --> 04:52.240
do a fuck ton of Miley Cyrus-based programming. But the problem with your whole idea of it being

04:52.240 --> 04:58.000
sexually provocative is that it like- It's not sexual at all? It literally, like, I have filed

04:58.000 --> 05:04.160
1099s that have been more sexually arousing than that whole performance. Yeah, but in defense,

05:04.160 --> 05:10.240
you file your 1099 by taking it to a strip club and tying two pins to a stripper's butt cheeks,

05:10.240 --> 05:17.360
and then making him twerk on top of it. Twerk my taxes. You know, Justin never gets his taxes

05:17.360 --> 05:22.320
done on time, and he doesn't write anything on the sheets. And it smells like buffet. It smells

05:22.320 --> 05:27.840
like buffets. I try to get him on TurboTwerk because it's cheaper. It's ultimately cheaper.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.560
This is My Brother, My Brother Me. It's an advice show for the modern era where we take your

05:32.560 --> 05:38.160
questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. Stop being a fucking pervert. That's point number

05:38.160 --> 05:43.120
one. Guess what? One day, Miley Cyrus is going to die, probably of old age if she gets there.

05:43.120 --> 05:48.720
You're not going to write, you remember when this old broad died. That wouldn't have happened if

05:48.720 --> 05:53.200
she was 12 years old. Yeah, no shit. People get older. Time passes. We're all traveling through

05:53.200 --> 05:57.440
fucking time. Where does Hannah Montana get off dying of old age? Do you guys think everyone

05:57.440 --> 06:03.200
else is just as surprised as we are when Robin Thicke shows up at performances now? As surprised

06:03.200 --> 06:08.480
as Robin Thicke is, maybe. In his head, the entire time, he can't stop thinking,

06:08.480 --> 06:14.560
I'm Alan Thicke's son. What am I even doing here? What am I doing here? It's only a matter of time

06:14.560 --> 06:19.360
before they see through the charade. I'm dressed like Beetlejuice. They have to see through this.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.480
They have to know what's up. They have to know I'm Alan Thicke's son. That's the dude from

06:22.480 --> 06:27.520
Not Quite Human. He's going to go around the bend, and Alan Thicke is going to be more edgy than

06:27.520 --> 06:32.080
Robin Thicke. He's got to be careful, because he's going to come out with some real role.

06:32.080 --> 06:42.560
Show me that frown again. That's his edgy song. Instead of wanting to see your smile,

06:43.120 --> 06:48.320
he wants to see your frown. I will soon be moving back to college for the second time at the age of

06:48.320 --> 06:54.640
27. I will most likely be older than most of my classmates and flatmates. English, please. I'm

06:54.640 --> 06:58.720
moving to a new city, and that won't help anyone. Have you any advice on how to deal with the

06:58.720 --> 07:04.320
situation in terms of making friends? Like with relationships, is there an age gap that makes

07:04.320 --> 07:12.880
friendships a bit weird? And that's from New to Newcastle. We're all taking a while to get to this

07:12.880 --> 07:20.400
one, because we all know what we have to say. No, there's no age gap to relationships.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.720
I had friends in college, at which point I was in my early 20s. I guess like 19 to 24,

07:28.720 --> 07:34.880
I was in college. Yeah, five years. I'll back off. But I had friends that I did not realize until a

07:34.880 --> 07:40.320
couple years into our friendship that they were in their late 20s or early 30s. It did not even

07:40.320 --> 07:46.400
occur to me. I have friends like that now that I started working with the theater, and I knew some

07:46.400 --> 07:50.240
of them for like two or three years, and then we had a birthday party for one of their 40th

07:50.240 --> 07:58.080
birthdays. And I was like, oh shit, I thought you were like 28. But at the same time in your classes

07:58.080 --> 08:05.360
as a freshman, when you look over and see somebody who's obviously nine years your senior, you get to

08:05.360 --> 08:11.680
have some questions. I think that's a normal thing. What questions, though? You're going

08:11.680 --> 08:17.200
to school. You're improving your life. It's not like the dude's 85 and going back to college.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.840
I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying it's a mysterious thing. I was about to say,

08:23.840 --> 08:31.200
then it's like a Rodney Dangerfield movie, when no, in fact, it is just a Rodney Dangerfield movie.

08:31.200 --> 08:39.760
I don't think he was 27 when that movie was. Hard livin'. Hard livin'. That was after the point

08:39.760 --> 08:44.400
when his face started to look like a fish's face, and I think that he hit that point.

08:45.440 --> 08:51.760
His face slid down. By the time he was 70, Rodney Dangerfield's face is on his belly.

08:51.760 --> 08:58.160
All people know that. Still hilarious. So funny. Funniest belly in the Catskills.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.360
He looks like the alien from the Men in Black movie that we reference

09:01.360 --> 09:05.360
in every episode of this podcast. I'm glad we're finally beating that

09:05.360 --> 09:08.560
pretty boy Rodney Dangerfield up. That'll teach it.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.840
Did you see him twerking at the VMAs? Who does he think he is?

09:13.840 --> 09:17.680
Where does he get off? He's gotten too much respect for too long.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.000
I think that when it comes to age and stuff in college, I think you are as old.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.680
You know, you're as old as you act. You're as old as you feel. I think that if you go in there

09:29.680 --> 09:34.720
being like, I'm out of place and I am too old and I don't fit in, that is exactly the vibe you're

09:34.720 --> 09:37.440
going to give off, and people are going to be like, yeah, I don't know.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.520
Yeah, I think that that's actually good. If you don't make a big thing of your age,

09:41.520 --> 09:47.280
nobody's going to grill you on it. But when I moved back to Huntington after

09:47.280 --> 09:53.200
college, I was like 23, 24, and I was hanging out with 19-year-olds, and it was no big deal.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.280
That young stuff. I'm 32,

09:57.280 --> 10:03.600
and whenever I go to the high school football games and just talk to the people in band about

10:03.600 --> 10:05.840
my glory days, I don't feel. You pull your van up

10:05.840 --> 10:10.080
right underneath the bleachers. Probably just shout up until one of them looks down.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.280
Yeah. Say, I got a stage pack if you guys want to share it.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.880
You want to check the smell of light in your tuba?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.680
They even made up a cute nickname for me. Him.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.040
Oh, that's nice.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.000
Or he's back.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.320
They call me that sometimes. He's back. Him.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.320
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

10:30.320 --> 10:35.200
Yeah, I would love that. I got a bunch of really, really good ones this week. Thank you guys all for

10:35.200 --> 10:41.520
sending them in. If you want to send any Yahoo, just shoot it to mbmbam at maximumfun.org,

10:41.520 --> 10:46.560
and I read every one. Thank you. This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.560
Are you Ira Ray?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.200
Ira Ray.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.560
Who wants to know? It's asked by Yahoo answer. She's a true beauty who asks,

10:55.040 --> 10:57.600
how can I legally change my dog's name?

11:00.160 --> 11:04.320
His name is Larry. I want to change it to Larry's Fiesta party on the house.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.640
I'm sorry.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.400
I'm going to open up a food truck inside my dog.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.640
Or additional details or hot dog party days.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.440
It's a really good name for a dog. Why do people keep sticking with one word name for dogs?

11:19.440 --> 11:22.560
Well, this person doesn't say is that this is the dog's request.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.960
Hey, Larry feels so unsophisticated, so unironic.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.720
I don't know what channels you need to go through, but I've written down some suggestions.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.320
It's why we don't teach dogs English because they ask for stupid things like this.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.720
This is why I brought this question up is because it brings up a good point.

11:40.720 --> 11:47.920
I'm learning all about sort of the life of dogs. We already discussed my revelation about dog

11:47.920 --> 11:52.960
periods. Dogs go through a lot of the same shit that we go through, but at the same time, if I

11:53.600 --> 12:02.480
take my dog, Larry, his previous given name was Larry, and I decided to change it to Larry's

12:02.480 --> 12:03.920
Fiesta party on the house.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.760
The puppy formerly known as Larry.

12:05.760 --> 12:14.240
Right. And I take LFPH to the vet and they're like, Larry? And I say, no, it's Larry's Fiesta

12:14.240 --> 12:21.440
party on the house. They're not going to be like, says here on his documentation, it's Larry,

12:21.440 --> 12:25.920
right? Or do I need to like go to the fucking courthouse, get a new social security card for

12:25.920 --> 12:31.040
my goddamn dog? I thought it was just like my property. Like if I call my table Jerry,

12:31.040 --> 12:35.680
then I can change it to Jerry's Fiesta party on the house, my table. I'm going to throw this out.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.760
There actually is a circumstance in which you would have to go through some channels to change

12:39.760 --> 12:45.600
your dog's name. What the fuck? If it is AKC registered, if it is registered with the American

12:45.600 --> 12:50.800
Kennel Club as a purebred dog, then you have to register your dog. If it's a competition dog?

12:50.800 --> 12:54.880
Is that what you're saying? No, if you breed it, our dog Nessie, Nessie was registered with the

12:54.880 --> 13:02.400
AKC as Nessie Bell Macaroy. We would have had to contact them to change her name. I changed my cat's

13:02.400 --> 13:08.560
name. That's because you're a fucking dummy. I'm sorry. She looked like a- At the time she looked

13:08.560 --> 13:13.680
like a Toby. That's my whole defense. Then it turned out when I got in there that- Her name

13:13.680 --> 13:24.080
was Kunta Kinte. I asshole. I don't like this. She was a woman. She was a cat woman. She wasn't

13:24.080 --> 13:29.760
a cat woman. She was a cat woman. This is my cat, cat woman. We have Toby on the books.

13:30.960 --> 13:35.280
We have Toby on the books. We're going to need you to change your story. We're going to need to see

13:35.280 --> 13:42.800
this cat's passport. What the fuck? This makes me angry. I think back to the pioneer days,

13:43.360 --> 13:50.160
horses didn't have no documentation. You know what I mean? What about when all the dogs go to heaven,

13:50.160 --> 13:53.520
don't you want St. Pete to have- What if he doesn't have them? Then they go to hell.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.040
I don't have a Larry Fiesta party on the house listed here.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.040
Can I break down actually Larry's Fiesta party on the house?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.200
On the house is a parenthetical.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.880
I mean, you could just do it. I mean, Fiesta party is obviously problematic.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.760
Because we're really just saying Larry party party.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.120
This is my dog Lawrence party party.

14:15.680 --> 14:21.200
Larry's Fiesta party casual get together. The dog. The movie.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.440
Did you see that movie?

14:26.000 --> 14:26.960
Oh, Christ.

14:28.560 --> 14:33.120
It asks or hot dog party days. I think Larry's Fiesta party is-

14:33.120 --> 14:36.560
I think we're pretty- Is that in case the first name is already taken?

14:38.560 --> 14:41.840
We actually already have Larry's Fiesta party.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.440
We have a champion Basset hound named Larry's Fiesta party on the house.

14:45.440 --> 14:50.640
This is fucking the fucking commentators at the Kennel Club show.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.680
The annual Kennel Club show. Ladies and gentlemen,

14:53.680 --> 14:57.200
I know this is going to get confusing, but here comes the second Larry's Fiesta party.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.480
Another purebred Basset hound.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.880
It's a battle of the Larry's Fiesta party on the house.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.360
Somehow we all knew it would come down to this.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.360
A hush falls over the crowd.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.080
And it all comes down to the heat of the genitals.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.320
They both defecate at the same time. It is perfect.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.360
We may have a multiverse situation. We may have a multiverse bleed.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.920
It's made eye contact from across the room.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.680
Travis, you know about dogs and shit.

15:30.240 --> 15:34.400
Is a perfect defecation a category in the Westminster Kennel Club-

15:34.400 --> 15:35.680
Only as a tiebreaker.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.240
Make it look like the little iPhone picture of poopy.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.240
Go.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.280
Do you mean emoticon?

15:46.160 --> 15:48.000
I actually have mean emojis.

15:48.000 --> 15:48.720
Oh, that's right.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.840
I forgot you finally learned that emojis is not teen slang for emotion,

15:53.840 --> 15:55.600
which it still should be.

15:57.040 --> 16:02.080
I recently purchased a few suits for a new job I got that requires me to look somewhat formal.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.720
I feel classy as hell wearing them.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.480
I don't want to wear them as often as possible,

16:06.480 --> 16:09.520
but my girlfriend keeps shooting me down saying I look silly.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.080
Aside from my job, when is classy but modern formal wear acceptable?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.360
I'm a college student as well.

16:15.360 --> 16:19.360
Would it be weird to wear a suit and tie to a college class

16:19.360 --> 16:21.360
or when I'm just hanging out on campus?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.280
That's from Suitless in Seattle.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.720
No, no, of course not.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.480
No, Minkus, go right for it.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.000
Can we go one episode with that?

16:30.000 --> 16:33.680
You know, whenever I tell my significant other, Sidney,

16:33.680 --> 16:36.800
to not wear something as formal,

16:36.800 --> 16:40.000
it's usually because I don't want to-

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Change out of your fat mama t-shirt?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.760
Yeah, I don't want to match her game.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.960
So maybe your girlfriend is just worried about having to step up her thing.

16:50.960 --> 16:57.360
It is also possible that you and your friends are going to go ironically to Chuck E. Cheese,

16:57.360 --> 16:59.600
and she does not want you to wear your suit there.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.400
Well, I mean, that's a pretty extreme example.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
I can think of like a hundred other ones,

17:04.400 --> 17:08.000
a hundred other ones, including one that you mentioned in the email,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.280
which is going to class.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.120
No, unless you're in fucking forensics, no.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.080
And even then, unless it's a debate day.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.200
And listen, here's the thing.

17:17.840 --> 17:21.440
You got to take a long, hard, cold look at yourself in the mirror.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.760
Turn the AC way, way, way down.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.440
Are you rocking that suit?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.560
Everybody thinks they rock their own suits, right?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.200
Yep.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.080
But are you?

17:31.520 --> 17:33.760
Everybody says, you know, you look really good in a suit.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.720
Well, yeah, they're suits.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.520
Yeah, they're suits.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.400
That's what they're there for.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.440
That's what they're there for.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.880
They hide all the bad things.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.000
They hide all the secrets.

17:40.000 --> 17:40.720
But here's the thing.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.640
If you wear the same thing every day, if you wear a suit every day, it will wear off.

17:45.200 --> 17:45.760
Sure.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.880
Like, I look really good in my plate mail armor that I own.

17:49.520 --> 17:49.760
Yeah.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.000
It's because it hides all of my secret dumps and bumps.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.960
See, you got to be careful because you can fall into like a Jesse Thorne scenario.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.000
And the situation I feel like he set up for himself is that

18:02.000 --> 18:04.880
he would wear a suit for a day-to-day function.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.280
And then if I see him at something more formal where I'm wearing a suit,

18:09.280 --> 18:14.160
I expect him to be in a tuxedo with a monocle riding a horse.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.880
In full-blown, like, military dress.

18:17.520 --> 18:21.280
If I am in full-blown military dress, I expect to see him in a diving bell.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.520
Wait, what?

18:23.520 --> 18:24.400
Why is he in that?

18:25.600 --> 18:26.480
The next step up.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.120
It's the most formal thing you can be in.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.640
I mean, this is a diving bell.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.720
I expect him to show up in like one of those suits that they wear in Tron.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.000
And he's like, this is what's above it.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.600
You didn't know because you've never been,

18:39.600 --> 18:41.440
you've never seen anything like this before.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.360
But this Tron is above military dress.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.680
Well, the invitation said Tron formal.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.240
Yeah.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.720
That's actually pronounced semi.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.920
And I think you're illiterate.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.240
It's my other worry.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.360
The flip side of that coin, though,

18:59.360 --> 19:01.520
is that I think if I have a picnic

19:01.520 --> 19:03.840
and Jesse Thorne comes to it wearing cargo shorts,

19:03.840 --> 19:05.520
then the entire park will burn down.

19:06.240 --> 19:06.480
Right.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.480
The universe can't handle that.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
If you become suit guy, that's fine.

19:11.920 --> 19:16.480
You know, we have a dude who was on ICOE with me.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.760
He is, like, every day a dress shirt and tie dude.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.320
You know what I mean?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.080
And he rocks it and he wears it.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.000
But there's a huge, there's a huge,

19:24.960 --> 19:28.880
a gargantuan difference between just shirt and tie and suit.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.560
And he can also rock a vest.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.440
Important to note.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.680
You're stepping, I mean, he's stepping closer to the line there.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.640
But every so often, like, one day a month,

19:36.640 --> 19:38.880
like, he'll roll up in, like, T-shirt and jeans

19:38.880 --> 19:41.200
and, like, everybody comments.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.040
Everybody's like, oh, just T-shirt and jeans today?

19:43.040 --> 19:43.520
What's up?

19:44.080 --> 19:47.680
And it's like, he's like, no, just wore T-shirt and jeans.

19:47.680 --> 19:48.800
But I feel like it's the same

19:48.800 --> 19:50.560
as if you wear T-shirt and jeans every day

19:50.560 --> 19:52.640
and then just roll up to class in, like, a suit.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.800
It's like if you're Hannah Montana for 20 years

19:54.800 --> 19:55.760
and then you torque.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.800
It's the same, exactly.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.040
Wow, but you're, but, you know, I even know.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.120
Sometimes Dubin comes into the office twerking.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.080
I was like, hey, why are you twerking today?

20:02.080 --> 20:06.240
I even draw a clearer delineation between school and work.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.920
I feel like no matter what your job is,

20:07.920 --> 20:11.680
if you wear, I mean, with most circumstances,

20:11.680 --> 20:14.640
if you wear a suit, it's pretty much just like a power play

20:14.640 --> 20:17.200
that says, I'm in a suit.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.240
Why aren't you in a suit?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.680
This is what we, this is what adults wear to work.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.880
Why don't you wear it?

20:22.880 --> 20:27.920
Well, because Arby's makes you wear a very specific uniform.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.960
Yeah, but if you wear a suit to Arby's,

20:30.960 --> 20:32.560
you're manager by the end of the week.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.280
Oh yeah.

20:33.280 --> 20:33.600
Period.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.680
I don't think that's how that, I don't think I,

20:35.680 --> 20:36.000
if I go to-

20:36.000 --> 20:37.680
Period the end, I said.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.280
If I go to Arby's and the cashier is wearing a full-blown suit,

20:41.280 --> 20:43.440
I'm gonna be like, thank you for the roast beef,

20:43.440 --> 20:44.480
but do you work here?

20:45.600 --> 20:46.560
Let me throw this out.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.040
Went to Home Depot, the cashier checked me out,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.520
was wearing cargo shorts and a polo shirt,

20:51.520 --> 20:55.280
and wait for it, a tie with his polo shirt.

20:56.240 --> 20:56.640
I am into this look.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.240
And a cabby hat.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.320
Oh my God.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.520
Wait, what's a cabby hat?

21:01.520 --> 21:03.200
A cabby hat, like a newsboy hat.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.000
And a flat cap.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.640
And then like some like bug-eye shaped glasses

21:08.640 --> 21:10.560
that were purely for decoration.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.360
Okay, was it fucking Puck from the real world?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.000
Did he wait on you at the Home Depot?

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I am 19 years old, and I'm a long time listener of the show.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.520
I enjoy smoking a pipe or cigar from time to time,

21:23.520 --> 21:27.520
but many of my friends think it's odd for someone my age.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.320
Even some clerks of the stores I purchase these products from

21:30.320 --> 21:32.160
act like it's weird for me to buy them.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.280
Is it strange that I enjoy these things?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.640
That's from Junius V.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.680
I don't think anyone actually enjoys a cigar.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.840
Yeah, I mean, I sure don't.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.400
I think a cigar is like a commitment that you make.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.600
Don't make, Travis, please.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
We've been on the internet for three years.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.840
Have you not learned that if you make a blanket statement

21:51.840 --> 21:53.200
on that, you're basically saying,

21:53.200 --> 21:56.240
hey, email me about your cigar life.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.960
Well, I don't think, like, what's the most expensive cigar

21:58.960 --> 22:00.800
that anyone on this podcast has smoked?

22:00.800 --> 22:05.040
Because I guarantee my like finest experience

22:05.040 --> 22:08.000
costs maybe like $3 at a gas station.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.600
I've had me a $20 cigar.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.840
I've had me a $20 cigar.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.880
Wow.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.640
Yeah, it was at a wedding.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.240
And it tasted exactly like a $1 cigar.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.160
I think it's probably like whiskey or brandy, right?

22:24.160 --> 22:26.000
Like you can't really appreciate.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.640
Maybe, but a cigar is just such a commitment

22:28.640 --> 22:30.800
or like this is what I'm doing for the next three hours

22:30.800 --> 22:33.200
or I'm gonna like stub it out or cut it off

22:33.200 --> 22:35.120
or do lots of weird shit.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.880
When someone hands you a cigar and they're like,

22:36.880 --> 22:40.080
smoke with me for the next three hours,

22:40.080 --> 22:42.400
it'll be stinkier than a billion cigarettes.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.120
Your mouth will taste like you ate

22:45.120 --> 22:46.640
a bunch of wet cigarette butt.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.680
That is a good point.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.240
If someone asks you to go smoke a cigar with them,

22:50.240 --> 22:53.360
they might as well be asking me to go on vacation.

22:53.360 --> 22:55.600
Like it's the same, I see it as the same,

22:55.600 --> 22:57.360
oh, we're gonna talk for three hours?

22:57.360 --> 22:58.880
Sounds good, sounds good.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.320
If I were on a yacht and that was like all I was doing

23:02.320 --> 23:04.880
for three hours, yes, I would probably have a cigar,

23:04.880 --> 23:06.720
but not like middle of a nice party

23:06.720 --> 23:07.920
where I'm hanging out with friends

23:07.920 --> 23:10.240
and somebody like, hey, do you wanna ignore everyone

23:10.240 --> 23:12.160
for like two and a half, three hours?

23:12.160 --> 23:14.160
Hey, you're never gonna wear that shirt again, right?

23:18.640 --> 23:20.640
Okay, so to actually answer your question

23:20.640 --> 23:23.040
rather than us just passing judgment on cigar smokers,

23:24.960 --> 23:26.080
a pipe is similar.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.720
A pipe could take you 30 minutes to an hour

23:28.720 --> 23:29.920
to smoke through a whole.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.760
Pipe don't stink like shit though.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.640
Yeah, everybody loves a pipe.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.680
Okay, but let's not, I really, I don't care about this

23:35.680 --> 23:38.720
but I really, really don't wanna get emails about cigars.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.680
Like I really don't.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.160
You don't even read the emails, I'll deal with it.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.480
I'll take this heat.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.720
The only way I have of educating myself

23:46.720 --> 23:49.920
about anything anymore is by saying mean shit

23:49.920 --> 23:52.160
about it on the internet and then I get very mean

23:52.160 --> 23:54.000
but very educational emails on the matter.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.040
That's how I learned about furries,

23:55.040 --> 23:56.240
that's how I learned about farmers.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.880
That's how I learned about jugglers.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.280
I like, I used to like a pipe.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.960
It's hard for me to wholeheartedly recommend

24:06.960 --> 24:09.440
any of this stuff now because there's kids.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.480
I mean, I can't do it.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.400
But here, I can tell you right now,

24:12.400 --> 24:15.040
I can pinpoint why it seems weird

24:16.080 --> 24:18.160
and I don't think it's because you're 19.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.320
I think it's because both of those things,

24:20.320 --> 24:22.320
a pipe and a cigar are so indicative

24:22.320 --> 24:25.200
of like a leisurely lifestyle of like,

24:25.200 --> 24:28.640
I'm a man who sits in my lounge and smokes a pipe

24:28.640 --> 24:30.560
while I read a thick book.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.680
Okay, so Travis, you're saying that a pipe

24:33.680 --> 24:37.040
or a cigar is like a victory lap for life.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.600
I am.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.440
And if you're younger, it's like,

24:39.440 --> 24:41.120
why aren't you out there on the hustle?

24:41.120 --> 24:42.400
Why aren't you on your game?

24:42.400 --> 24:45.840
I think it's just like we see a kid smoking a pipe

24:45.840 --> 24:47.280
and we're like, you haven't earned that.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.080
Yeah.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.920
You don't get to just do that.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.920
Well, I think a part of that,

24:51.920 --> 24:53.360
and I'm not saying that this is the case

24:53.360 --> 24:55.440
for our dear beloved listener,

24:55.440 --> 24:59.360
but I think that these two things fall into the long list

24:59.360 --> 25:03.520
of things that like super grown ass adults do

25:03.520 --> 25:07.360
that in college kind of plays like an affectation.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.800
And I'm not saying that that's the case,

25:08.800 --> 25:11.600
but I like, I don't know, for 19,

25:11.600 --> 25:14.160
I didn't know any 19 year olds that smoke cigars and pipes,

25:14.800 --> 25:18.480
but I did know a lot of 22 year olds who did it.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.680
But if you were like the kid

25:19.680 --> 25:22.400
who only drinks fine brandy at parties,

25:22.960 --> 25:25.760
it's like, yeah, at 19, that's incredibly douchey

25:25.760 --> 25:28.320
and at like 59, it's incredibly classy

25:28.320 --> 25:30.240
without with very little difference.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.440
You gotta earn that shit.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.480
You gotta have some kids.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.160
You gotta lose some wives.

25:34.160 --> 25:34.720
You know what I mean?

25:35.840 --> 25:39.200
You gotta see like the nitty gritty shit of the world.

25:39.200 --> 25:39.840
You know what I mean?

25:39.840 --> 25:42.640
You gotta be crushed down and build yourself back up

25:42.640 --> 25:44.480
or just stop doing it in front of people.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.800
Just keep it like a secret.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.640
Yeah, that is a thing.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.960
Also, I think with pipes and cigars is that

25:50.960 --> 25:53.440
it's such a production that if you're doing it around people,

25:53.440 --> 25:56.800
you're really saying like, hey, check this out.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.480
Check this out, especially a pipe.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.800
Oh God, it's like you're making a Subway sandwich

26:03.120 --> 26:05.600
because you gotta get the pipe out.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.120
You gotta clean it with a pipe cleaner

26:07.120 --> 26:08.560
that you keep in a separate bag

26:08.560 --> 26:09.920
and then you gotta get your tobacco out

26:09.920 --> 26:11.040
and then you gotta make everyone smell

26:11.040 --> 26:12.480
like it smells so good.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.480
And then you gotta stuff it in with the ramrod

26:14.480 --> 26:16.400
and then you gotta light it, which takes forever.

26:16.400 --> 26:21.360
And then you gotta drizzle mustard on top of the tobacco.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.000
When I used to smoke a pipe, I did know,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.320
I felt like it was an affectation,

26:26.320 --> 26:28.880
but the thing about it is,

26:28.880 --> 26:30.800
if you do an affectation for long enough,

26:30.800 --> 26:32.080
it's just your thing.

26:32.080 --> 26:35.840
You have to do it until someone else tries to do it

26:35.840 --> 26:37.440
and then it's their affectation.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.400
Like, they're the low man on the smoking totem pole.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.960
And listen, smoking a pipe is awesome.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.520
Yeah, it's great.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.200
Don't get one of those fucking Lord of the Rings

26:47.920 --> 26:49.440
long ass Tolkien pipes.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.280
Don't do a Sherlock either.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.280
Don't do a Sherlock, just get a basic ass-

26:53.280 --> 26:54.320
How long did I do a Sherlock?

26:54.320 --> 26:56.080
Griffin got me this beautiful pear wood pipe

26:56.080 --> 26:57.920
that I still enjoy from time to time.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.360
That was for display only.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.240
You're smoking that?

27:01.200 --> 27:01.840
Oh God.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.120
That was soaked in resin.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.280
Bong resin.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.120
I used it as a bong for four years.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.000
Bong resin.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.320
Oh, just smoke a bong.

27:10.320 --> 27:11.840
Just smoke a bunch of weed.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.040
What are you doing?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.560
That's why all the adults judge you

27:14.560 --> 27:15.360
because they're sitting there going,

27:15.360 --> 27:16.400
do you know why I smoke this pipe?

27:16.400 --> 27:17.840
Because I can't smoke weed anymore.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.800
What are you doing?

27:18.800 --> 27:19.680
Actually, you know what?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.200
That's a great point.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.920
When you're an adult, you'll be able to buy cigars.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.880
Once you get to be my age,

27:26.880 --> 27:28.960
you don't know where weed is anymore.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.040
When you are handed the diploma by the dean,

27:31.040 --> 27:33.120
the dean says hand over all your doobers.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.120
Hand over your final doobers.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.720
Should have smoked these last night, chief.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.880
Oh, you fucked up bad.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.400
Nobody's ever been to a party-

27:42.400 --> 27:44.800
Enjoy your shitty cigars that do nothing for you

27:44.800 --> 27:46.560
except give you dry mouth the next day.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.680
When you're at a party

27:47.680 --> 27:50.240
and you stand next to somebody smoking a cigar,

27:50.240 --> 27:53.360
you think, oh man, they're going to be doing that for a while.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.080
We better move.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.760
And if you see them smoking weed, you think,

27:55.760 --> 27:58.960
oh man, it would be cool if you offered that.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.240
If you said, hey-

28:02.240 --> 28:04.000
If you pass that on the left-hand side.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.080
I wish that that man was standing closer to me

28:08.080 --> 28:10.640
so I might absorb some of his magic.

28:10.640 --> 28:24.160
Hey Travis, who's this message for?

28:24.160 --> 28:25.280
It's for Lance Taylor.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.360
Hey Griffin, who's this message from?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.280
It's from Brett, Shelby, Jordan, and Alyssa.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.920
Hey Justin, what is the message?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.520
Wishing our cousin Lance a belated happy birthday.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.000
He never ceases to live like he's dying,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.160
which is a mentality that's easy to achieve

28:42.160 --> 28:44.880
once you turn 30, then new 40.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.120
Also with introducing us and others to MBMBAM,

28:47.120 --> 28:50.080
he enjoys video games, music, and hanging out with his family.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.640
We love you and hope you are alive to celebrate next year.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.840
That's grim.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.400
That's a little grim.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.840
The first time I read through it,

28:55.840 --> 28:58.640
I thought it said he never ceases to be dying.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.800
Yeah, well, but that's true too, right?

29:00.800 --> 29:01.920
It's very depressing for a moment.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.040
It's very true though, right?

29:03.040 --> 29:04.080
It's true though.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.520
Here's a haunting reminder of your ephemeral existence.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.680
I like upscaling that 30 to 40 thing

29:09.680 --> 29:11.360
because since I turned 26,

29:11.360 --> 29:13.840
I'm pretty convinced that 26 is the new 75.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.360
It's strange though because it's not a sliding scale

29:17.360 --> 29:21.920
because 27 is the new 82, but then 28 is the new 46.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.600
Yeah, you get downgraded.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.640
But yeah, oh God, guys, I'm falling apart.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.680
I think I have just entire bones missing.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.800
I think I'm just missing entire bones.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.120
The tooth fairy actually gets greedy as you get older.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.160
She comes for your bones.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.200
She leaves your teeth though, which is nice.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.600
Hey, do you like TV, you guys?

29:42.160 --> 29:42.640
I guess.

29:43.840 --> 29:44.640
I mean, I like watching.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.120
That's a medium, you know?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.080
I like shows.

29:48.960 --> 29:53.520
We have been paid to tell you about a product

29:53.520 --> 29:57.680
that we're pretty sure everybody in the world already has.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.280
Hulu Plus, of course, you know,

30:01.280 --> 30:04.080
it lets you watch thousands of hit shows wherever you want.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.360
You can stream it on your TV

30:05.360 --> 30:07.920
or like your smartphone or your tablet

30:07.920 --> 30:09.360
and you can binge watch shows.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.320
Or all three at the same time.

30:10.320 --> 30:10.800
All three.

30:10.800 --> 30:14.160
If you need constant entertainment like I do.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.160
Talks about binge watching your favorite shows

30:16.160 --> 30:19.040
like SNL, Community, Modern Family, shows like that.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.120
Like you could get through a whole season

30:21.680 --> 30:23.680
of Community in like an hour

30:23.680 --> 30:25.680
if you just stream them from four devices

30:25.680 --> 30:26.480
that you simultaneously.

30:26.480 --> 30:29.360
Yeah, surround yourself like in Swordfish.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.920
Oh, just watch, do they have Swordfish on Hulu Plus?

30:31.920 --> 30:32.400
Probably.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.120
Can you get Swordfish?

30:33.120 --> 30:34.800
I'm almost certain they have Cabin Boy,

30:34.800 --> 30:36.640
but I don't think it's the same thing.

30:36.640 --> 30:42.320
It's only $79 a day.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.680
What are you doing?

30:43.680 --> 30:46.000
It is $7.99 a month.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.240
$7.99 for all the shows and movies you can watch.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.720
It's super cheap for infinite television.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.280
You can binge on old classics.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.080
You can watch movies.

30:54.080 --> 30:54.800
They got movies.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.520
It's great, but like they came to us

30:57.520 --> 31:00.000
and they're like, here's three free codes to do Hulu Plus.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.520
And it's like, thanks, but we all literally already have it

31:03.520 --> 31:04.800
because everybody has Hulu.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.720
They're like, here's three social security cards.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.520
Like we have those.

31:08.160 --> 31:08.960
We don't need those.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.520
But on the off chance that you don't,

31:11.520 --> 31:14.480
go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother

31:15.120 --> 31:19.040
and prove that this is apparently a thing

31:19.040 --> 31:19.840
that people don't have.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.520
And you can get two free weeks

31:21.520 --> 31:25.360
by going to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.560
And yeah, and if you don't use it,

31:26.560 --> 31:28.560
it's great because Hulu Plus is awesome.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.880
And it also makes us look like super cool dudes.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.360
Who deserve more Hulu money,

31:33.360 --> 31:35.360
even though everybody already has it.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.320
Let him keep flushing this money down the toilet.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.000
Down the toilet of our wallet.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.720
Hey, hey, have you been looking to integrate

31:44.720 --> 31:46.320
the toilet into your lovemaking?

31:46.320 --> 31:48.640
Boy, if I got a place for you to go,

31:48.640 --> 31:50.400
it's called extremistraints.com.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.760
Tell me more about this website, Justin.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.360
Again, it's like Hulu fucking Plus.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.000
It's like, doesn't everybody already have every dildo?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Every, every faux gaper.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.680
Don't they have all that shit already?

32:01.680 --> 32:05.120
Don't they already have all the sex furniture?

32:05.120 --> 32:06.960
They could, let me tell you about the door.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.960
Oh man, the doggy style locking spreader is great

32:10.960 --> 32:14.160
because sometimes when I'm about to get my butthole blasted,

32:14.160 --> 32:17.120
I'll flake out late in the game.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.280
Like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.920
Or you have to sneeze and it's like, oh no.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.960
Great, now my kidney's on the ground.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.920
But the great thing about the doggy style spreading locker

32:29.920 --> 32:33.360
is for, or sorry, the doggy style locking spreader,

32:34.640 --> 32:36.000
it's just $188.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.640
There's probably one of those too, a spreading locker.

32:40.080 --> 32:43.600
For just $188, you can buy one of these

32:43.600 --> 32:46.240
and you can cuff your hands and your ankles together

32:46.240 --> 32:48.960
and let someone just go to town.

32:48.960 --> 32:52.560
Yeah, we'll see if this multimedia

32:52.560 --> 32:54.160
that I'm trying to incorporate in the show works.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.400
But I just texted both of you a picture

32:56.400 --> 32:59.520
that I took of a vending machine in a German bathroom.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.680
And let's just wait until it gets there

33:01.680 --> 33:05.200
and then we can fold it into the experience of the show.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.240
Oh, there we go.

33:11.920 --> 33:16.320
This is a product that is sold in this German vending machine.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.160
I did not purchase it because it was three euro

33:18.160 --> 33:19.200
and I had already exchanged.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.920
It's a product called Travel Pussy.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.840
Is that people who need a neck pillow all the time

33:27.840 --> 33:29.520
anytime they're on a flight?

33:29.520 --> 33:30.960
I think the Travel Pussy, yeah,

33:30.960 --> 33:33.760
it's someone who's actually afraid of going through security.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.440
Hold my hand, we're taking off.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.680
Oh, just, oh, come on.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.280
What is Travel Pussy?

33:39.280 --> 33:41.760
This is, I did not buy this product,

33:41.760 --> 33:43.760
but people I know did.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.400
This sounds like somebody, a friend of mine.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.160
I didn't, but a friend, no.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.320
It's a guy named Miffin Grackleroy.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.800
Apparently it's just a, and I don't wanna get coarse

33:56.800 --> 33:57.920
and I don't wanna get blue,

33:57.920 --> 33:59.360
because it's not that kind of show,

33:59.360 --> 34:04.320
but apparently it's just a plastic bag with some lube.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.640
And if that's like true love waits,

34:08.640 --> 34:12.320
and like obviously I believe in that and I'm waiting,

34:12.320 --> 34:16.080
but if it's just a wet garbage bag,

34:16.080 --> 34:18.640
like I'm just gonna go hang myself.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.320
Like if that's what I've been waiting for

34:20.320 --> 34:23.200
and that's what I've been looking forward to, I'm dead.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.680
Griffin, important, important question.

34:25.680 --> 34:28.400
What else was in the vending machine?

34:28.400 --> 34:31.520
Oh, I mean, I can text you another pick.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.640
Well, because if you could get a Travel Pussy LMRs bar,

34:34.640 --> 34:36.480
I'm gonna be really excited.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.360
This is gonna cover me for the whole trip.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.480
But you don't want this,

34:40.480 --> 34:41.920
you don't want that kind of low grade shit.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.320
You want the good stuff on ExtremeRestraints.com.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.960
Stuff that'll bend your penis into the shape of a snake

34:46.960 --> 34:49.200
for $50, but not $50 because that's the price.

34:49.200 --> 34:52.480
To be fair, most penises are already in the shape of a snake.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.520
Like a cobra about to strike them.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
Okay. Smart Alec.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.840
You can get one for 20% off

34:59.840 --> 35:02.240

35:02.240 --> 35:03.920

35:03.920 --> 35:06.240

35:06.240 --> 35:07.520
Go fuck yourself.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.680
Go fuck yourself, ExtremeRestraints.com.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
That is not their slogan.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.560
No. Coupon code Sexabunga.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.800
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.320
I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.040
You told me to say it that way.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.400
We have a medical history show called Sawbones right here on Maximum Fun

35:26.400 --> 35:29.760
where we talk about all the dumb, hurtful,

35:29.760 --> 35:32.720
damaging ways that we've tried to fix people over the years.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.840
Have you ever tried to put mercury on a syphilis shanker?

35:35.840 --> 35:38.000
Or maybe you tried to drill a hole in your head

35:38.000 --> 35:39.920
because you heard it would reduce your blood-brain volume?

35:40.480 --> 35:41.520
That was dumb.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.600
But if you want to know exactly why

35:43.600 --> 35:46.720
and know about all the other people that try to do the same dumb thing you did,

35:46.720 --> 35:53.920
you can listen to our show every Friday right here on MaximumFun.org.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.120
Let's move on.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.240
Griffin, how about another Yahi?

35:56.240 --> 35:57.120
You got one of those lying around?

35:57.120 --> 35:57.840
You're not going to do Farm Wisdom?

36:00.080 --> 36:01.360
Farm Wisdom!

36:02.240 --> 36:03.120
Farm Wisdom.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.240
Call your Uncle Jake Farm Wisdom.

36:06.240 --> 36:06.880
That one.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.000
It's not my best.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.800
It's not his name.

36:10.160 --> 36:10.480
What?

36:10.480 --> 36:11.280
What are you talking about?

36:11.280 --> 36:12.880
Our uncles, we don't have an Uncle Jake.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.600
I was going to rhyme it with something

36:15.600 --> 36:16.800
I ran out of syllables.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.600
I thought you said Uncle Drake, like the performer.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.560
My Uncle Drake?

36:22.560 --> 36:24.240
He played Jimmy on Degrassi?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.840
Why don't you read it, Travis?

36:27.840 --> 36:32.480
To trap slugs, bury a dish to ground level and fill with beer.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.520
Slugs crawl in and drown in beer.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.760
Also, apparently slugs prefer dark beer.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.040
And that is from Laura.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.520
And she says, PS, I am an actual farmer.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.360
That's handy.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.400
But you're also going to get a lot of high schoolers.

36:48.560 --> 36:48.960
Just drink up.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.720
Another one drowning here, Margaret.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.720
Boy, you know how desperate you have to be

36:52.720 --> 36:54.720
to impress your friends to say,

36:54.720 --> 36:57.040
I know there's a farm we can drive out to

36:57.040 --> 36:59.520
where we can squirt some brew

36:59.520 --> 37:02.960
that may have the occasional 80 slugs in it.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.080
How much you ask?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.360
About half a bowl's worth.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.640
Depends on how much the slugs get.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.840
Who wants to kick back a bowl of suds and slugs?

37:11.840 --> 37:13.040
Slugs and slugs.

37:13.040 --> 37:13.540
What?

37:15.680 --> 37:16.560
Suds and slugs.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.320
I said I knew where beer was.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.000
That's what I said.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.680
Really, it's your fault for not asking any follow up questions.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.160
Right.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.280
You should, when I said, hey, I know where beer is,

37:27.280 --> 37:30.080
you should have said, hey, Jeff, quick follow up.

37:30.080 --> 37:30.880
Is there slugs?

37:32.480 --> 37:34.080
Is there slugs, too?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.640
You could be the worst cool older brother ever.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.120
Mark that on this map and I'll sell it to you for $15.

37:41.120 --> 37:41.600
No problem.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.040
I could screw you guys some brew.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.880
Well, I'm where the map told me to be.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.560
But all I see is sort of brown drunk slugs.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.680
Oh, you didn't tell me your position on slugs.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.120
Wasn't aware.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.080
Wasn't aware, Steve.

37:54.080 --> 37:54.640
Sorry, guys.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.840
You're squeamish.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.360
Got a date with a prom queen.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.360
Gotta go, your older brother.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.720
This next one is applicable because I do have an ant problem.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.480
If ants start invading your home,

38:06.480 --> 38:10.000
lay down or sprinkle cinnamon wherever you think the ants are coming from.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.200
Ants hate cinnamon.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.160
It's environmentally safe, so it also works in gardens.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.280
That's from our buddy, Asumen Mariko.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.200
I want to say I'm really glad that he gave us the option

38:19.200 --> 38:21.760
so we can either sprinkle it or just lay it down.

38:24.800 --> 38:25.360
Get cozy.

38:26.000 --> 38:26.880
I'll put you right here.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.080
You're gonna be okay.

38:28.080 --> 38:28.880
Hey, Simminen.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.400
Hey, Simminen.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.720
Hey, Simminen, baby.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.240
Just lay down.

38:37.120 --> 38:37.920
Do you guys want Yahoo?

38:38.560 --> 38:39.060
Yeah.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.180
Yahoo.

38:40.180 --> 38:44.180
This Yahoo was sent in by Richard Chachere or Chachere.

38:45.060 --> 38:45.460
Thank you.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.900
Are you Richard Chachere?

38:48.340 --> 38:49.460
He is.

38:49.460 --> 38:49.780
Yes.

38:49.780 --> 38:51.380
Yes, I am.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.420
Did you need-

38:52.420 --> 38:53.220
No, okay.

38:53.220 --> 38:56.900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jenny who asks,

38:58.660 --> 39:04.500
why is a big chest or doing it on a bed not called a fetish,

39:04.500 --> 39:07.300
but toilet time love is called a fetish?

39:07.300 --> 39:07.800
Wow.

39:07.800 --> 39:08.300
Wow.

39:08.300 --> 39:08.800
Wow.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.120
A lot of textbook terms in there.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.720
What if everyone around me also likes toilet time love?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.440
On some websites, does that mean they're normal?

39:18.440 --> 39:22.040
And people who need big chests or being kissed

39:22.040 --> 39:23.560
are like weird because they're different.

39:28.360 --> 39:31.320
Does she mean big chests like bosoms

39:31.320 --> 39:34.840
or like doing it inside of a large trunk?

39:34.840 --> 39:37.720
Get inside of this treasure chest.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.640
You are my treasure and I'm going to fuck you.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.200
Avast.

39:42.200 --> 39:42.760
Avast.

39:42.760 --> 39:43.640
Ahoy.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.140
Yarr.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.760
I hate when a Yahoo Answer question is like a good-

39:47.960 --> 39:49.400
It's a good fucking, right?

39:49.400 --> 39:50.920
It's a good fucking point, Yahoo Answers.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.800
How come everybody kisses and that's fine,

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
but I want to have toilet time fun

39:55.800 --> 39:58.360
and whatever that may be, I'm not sure yet.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.120
Travis, it's not toilet time fun, okay?

40:00.120 --> 40:01.240
This is love.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.240
It's toilet time party fiesta in the house.

40:03.240 --> 40:06.600
Travis, do you make fun to your fiance?

40:08.040 --> 40:08.840
Pardon?

40:08.840 --> 40:09.320
Do you make-

40:09.320 --> 40:10.440
We listen to fun.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.360
Do you make fun to your fiance?

40:12.920 --> 40:13.800
Fun dip?

40:13.800 --> 40:14.440
What did you say?

40:16.040 --> 40:17.560
I make fun with her.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.960
I would call what we do making fun.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.040
What happened, folks?

40:30.040 --> 40:32.200
It took us 160 some episodes.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.760
The show is too weird for me to listen to.

40:34.760 --> 40:35.800
Good night, everybody.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.880
That's great, because in that statement,

40:37.880 --> 40:40.680
I think I alienated both my brothers and my fiance.

40:40.680 --> 40:41.400
Yeah, well done.

40:42.520 --> 40:43.960
Yeah, it's a record.

40:45.080 --> 40:45.560
I apologize.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.440
That question was the fucking Kobayashi Maru.

40:48.440 --> 40:49.240
I apologize.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.840
There's no winning there.

40:52.840 --> 40:58.360
I feel like a fetish is the equivalent of being into an indie band.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.600
Like, if everybody likes it,

41:00.600 --> 41:02.920
then it doesn't feel like a fetish anymore.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.160
It's just sort of a common thing.

41:06.680 --> 41:08.760
If fetish feels special to you, it's like,

41:08.760 --> 41:10.440
oh, this is my special thing.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.840
The thing, isn't it, that indie bands,

41:13.560 --> 41:16.040
the fucking Vampire Weekend was super indie,

41:16.040 --> 41:18.680
and then they got a Grammy, didn't they?

41:20.200 --> 41:22.040
Arcade Fire used to be indiest of the indie,

41:22.040 --> 41:23.000
and then they got a Grammy.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.040
What I'm saying is that-

41:24.040 --> 41:25.480
Anal Sex used to be a fetish,

41:25.480 --> 41:26.920
and then it was on the VMAs.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.520
And then it was on the VMAs.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.040
But are we, in like a few years,

41:32.040 --> 41:33.880
just gonna be pooping on each other and that's it?

41:34.440 --> 41:36.440
And then that's just the thing?

41:36.440 --> 41:37.160
That's the new-

41:37.160 --> 41:39.160
Missionary was probably a fetish at some point.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.160
Listen, I'm gonna throw this out, though.

41:41.160 --> 41:45.720
What if it's not that it becomes more prevalent,

41:45.720 --> 41:47.560
but that it becomes simply more accepted?

41:48.760 --> 41:51.480
That there's not an increase in the performing of the act,

41:51.480 --> 41:55.400
but rather illumination brought to the performing of the act?

41:55.400 --> 41:57.880
What the fuck are you talking about?

41:57.880 --> 42:00.120
That everyone's always been pooping on each other.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.360
We've just been afraid to talk about it, people.

42:02.360 --> 42:08.120
I guess in the fucking atomic sense, yes.

42:09.080 --> 42:12.920
When you break it down to the subatomic level, yes.

42:13.640 --> 42:16.520
I don't think most fetishes can hold this kind of atomic scrutiny.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.680
Hey guys, my wife and I finally found out

42:22.680 --> 42:24.440
she's pregnant with our first child,

42:24.440 --> 42:26.760
and we're waiting to tell my mom face to face

42:26.760 --> 42:28.600
when we see her on Labor Day weekend.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.040
I hope she doesn't listen.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.760
I was wondering if you three have any tips

42:32.760 --> 42:35.320
for the grand reveal of a grandkid.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.880
That's from Inducing in Indianapolis.

42:37.880 --> 42:38.920
Oh, this is a good one.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.440
We've never gotten one of these before.

42:40.440 --> 42:44.840
No, we've gotten a lot, a lot of proposal things.

42:44.840 --> 42:47.720
Also a lot of how do I sleep with my best friend's girlfriend.

42:48.760 --> 42:49.800
Did we really?

42:49.800 --> 42:50.680
Yeah, we get a lot of those.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.400
I filtered those out because I don't want to hurt your delicate ears.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.640
But you just like created this-

42:55.640 --> 42:56.520
Oh no.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.120
This sense of terror in my mind

42:58.120 --> 43:01.720
that like 90% of the people that listen to our show are adulterers.

43:01.720 --> 43:02.920
Yeah, would be.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.640
We stop them because we do not help them.

43:05.640 --> 43:08.120
Like they're fucking waiting on our, waiting on your go guys.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.480
I've had my eye on Susan for a wicked long time.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.760
Wait, still waiting on the go ahead.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.960
If you were planning on having your mother-in-law listen to this,

43:17.960 --> 43:20.680
or your mom listen to this,

43:21.800 --> 43:23.480
I'm sorry that we put that part in there

43:23.480 --> 43:27.480
as like, if you're going to use this as your grand reveal.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.160
You are such an egotist.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.960
You really think they're going to be like,

43:31.960 --> 43:35.080
we just know that they're going to do it for us.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.720
So let's just plug these earbuds into grandma's ears.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.520
We could just record a whole episode where it's just like,

43:40.520 --> 43:42.440
you're fired and a bunch of like news

43:42.440 --> 43:44.440
that you want to get people through our podcast.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.040
That would be great.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.760
Maybe like we could record people's answering machine messages.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.240
We're like the new Carl Castle.

43:51.240 --> 43:54.520
People have said that about us.

43:54.520 --> 43:55.880
Okay, you guys, that's not just me.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.880
I think the best way to tell her is to spend the whole party

43:59.880 --> 44:02.040
convincing your family that she's not drinking

44:02.040 --> 44:03.480
because of her alcohol problem.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.720
And then at the end be like, no, just kidding.

44:07.720 --> 44:09.240
She's, she's preggers.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.000
And everyone will be like twice as happy.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.680
Or check this out, check this out.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.440
You turn all the lights off in the room

44:14.440 --> 44:15.640
and you gather everybody around

44:15.640 --> 44:17.720
and then you shine a flashlight on her back

44:17.720 --> 44:19.560
and then it'll show up on the wall.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.880
It's like the bat signal.

44:21.880 --> 44:25.080
It's a lot like the bat signal, but it's a baby signal.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.880
Oh, just say like everybody who's pregnant

44:27.880 --> 44:30.600
take one step forward and then she'll step forward.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.120
And we're like, oh, okay.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.160
That's pretty good.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.840
Yeah, that's a pressure situation

44:34.840 --> 44:36.920
because then what if someone else steps forward too?

44:38.120 --> 44:40.520
Then your fucking announcement is worth.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.600
What if everyone steps forward?

44:42.600 --> 44:43.560
We're all pregnant.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.960
Except you, Dave.

44:45.960 --> 44:46.920
Ah, damn it.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.720
Ah, damn it.

44:47.720 --> 44:50.040
Listen, Rod, thanks for coming into my office.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.760
This script you turned in for the new episode,

44:52.760 --> 44:54.120
The Twilight Zone.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.600
I don't think that this is gonna work.

44:56.600 --> 44:57.000
What do you mean?

44:57.000 --> 44:58.840
We've all been pregnant for years.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.280
We've all been pregnant for years.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.440
The title of your new Twilight Zone episode

45:02.440 --> 45:05.080
is neither spooky nor sensical.

45:05.080 --> 45:07.480
It does not meet any of the basic criteria

45:07.480 --> 45:09.240
of being logically sound

45:09.240 --> 45:11.400
or in any way spooky for The Twilight Zone.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.920
But thank you for trying, Rod.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.760
Don't worry, we're gonna save it in a vault

45:14.760 --> 45:16.520
until Star Trek Next Generation

45:16.520 --> 45:18.440
and then they'll make the episode.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.400
You could write like a nice card.

45:29.160 --> 45:29.960
Skywriting.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.880
Can you just deliver the baby?

45:35.080 --> 45:36.200
That'd be a nice surprise.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.960
It's like when Sega announced the Sega Saturn.

45:37.960 --> 45:39.400
They're like, by the way, it's already out.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.440
You could do the same thing,

45:41.000 --> 45:42.600
but the baby would be the Sega Saturn.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.320
Or just bring everyone to Sega Saturn.

45:45.320 --> 45:46.680
That would work too.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.000
What if you just rolled up with a baby in your arms

45:49.000 --> 45:49.960
and be like, what?

45:49.960 --> 45:51.080
And be like, here's a preview.

45:52.680 --> 45:53.800
Then you drop the baby.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.200
One of these is gonna come out of her super soon.

45:56.200 --> 45:56.920
Can you believe that?

45:58.600 --> 46:00.040
Man, woman's bodies are a miracle.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.320
Am I right, you guys?

46:01.320 --> 46:02.440
Mom, be honest with me.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.640
Does Melanie look chunky?

46:05.400 --> 46:05.960
Here's the thing.

46:08.680 --> 46:10.840
I don't have kids.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.640
Fingers crossed, one day.

46:13.640 --> 46:18.840
But like, to me, if my child came to me

46:20.040 --> 46:22.760
and said, my wife is pregnant,

46:22.760 --> 46:24.280
what I'm going to hear is,

46:24.840 --> 46:27.080
I've had sex with this person at least one time.

46:29.480 --> 46:30.680
And that would be disquieting.

46:30.680 --> 46:31.960
Why don't you just keep it to yourself

46:31.960 --> 46:33.160
and then the baby will come

46:33.160 --> 46:36.760
and they'll be so happy about the actual arrival of the baby

46:36.760 --> 46:43.160
that they won't be disquieted by your obvious coitus?

46:43.160 --> 46:45.400
Well, you're like rubbing your sexual exploits

46:45.400 --> 46:47.640
in your mom's face at that point,

46:47.640 --> 46:48.600
which seems pretty rude.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.400
Yeah, make your wife show up in a t-shirt that says,

46:51.400 --> 46:55.640
conquered, because that's all you're saying with your baby

46:55.640 --> 46:57.960
is like, I put my flag in this mountain.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.880
Maybe like a really great mixtape.

47:01.640 --> 47:03.080
Something with baby in the title.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.480
Are there any songs with baby in the title?

47:05.480 --> 47:08.040
At least there's a Justin Bieber song

47:08.040 --> 47:11.800
with enough uses of the word baby

47:11.800 --> 47:13.800
to just make up for all the other tracks on the album.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.640
Oh, shit, flash mob.

47:17.000 --> 47:17.960
Flash mob.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.160
Everybody seems like the baby from Alan McBeal.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.680
Travis, I'm trying to meme flash mob.

47:22.680 --> 47:24.680
Can you just lean in here with me?

47:24.680 --> 47:25.240
Yeah.

47:25.240 --> 47:26.040
Flash mob.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.000
Flash mob.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.160
Because you tell him, that's how you tell him.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.960
Soldier boy tell him, can you get soldier boy?

47:34.600 --> 47:37.320
That'd be the best courier service.

47:37.960 --> 47:38.920
Soldier boy tell him.

47:38.920 --> 47:41.240
Soldier boy tell him that this is a summons

47:41.240 --> 47:42.040
to appear in court.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.280
Soldier boy tell him we all think he has a problem

47:48.280 --> 47:49.160
and needs to cut back.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.920
Soldier boy, we do wish that you would stop just sticking

47:52.920 --> 47:54.520
the notices on people's backs.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.240
I know, yes, you're Superman-ing that ho,

47:57.240 --> 47:58.840
but it is inappropriate.

47:58.840 --> 48:03.560
Soldier boy, I have a very dark secret to tell you

48:03.560 --> 48:06.760
and I need you, can I count on you

48:06.760 --> 48:10.440
to keep this message in the absolute confidence?

48:11.880 --> 48:13.000
Don't tell him.

48:13.000 --> 48:13.880
Don't, soldier boy.

48:13.880 --> 48:14.440
Promise me.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.000
Soldier boy.

48:16.040 --> 48:19.640
I cheated on Margaret, soldier boy, you can't tell him.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.240
To your grave, soldier boy.

48:21.240 --> 48:22.120
To your fucking grave.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.160
I gotta tell him.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.400
Soldier boy, you can't.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.440
I blame myself.

48:26.440 --> 48:29.480
Robocop, you can't, soldier boy, I need you to be quiet.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.160
Margaret is in the other room.

48:31.160 --> 48:33.000
Why are you guys talking about robocop?

48:33.000 --> 48:34.360
Soldier boy, don't you fuck me.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.400
Soldier boy, don't you fuck me.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.040
You promised me.

48:38.040 --> 48:38.760
Say the words.

48:39.320 --> 48:41.080
Say the words, you promised not to tell him.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.000
I hope he listens.

48:47.720 --> 48:51.080
I hope so too, for so many reasons.

48:51.960 --> 48:53.400
You want another yahoo?

48:53.400 --> 48:54.440
Yeah, sure.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.400
It's about soldier boy,

48:55.400 --> 48:57.160
because that's all I'm thinking about for the rest of the show.

48:58.360 --> 48:58.860
You!

49:00.280 --> 49:02.040
This yahoo is sitting in also beverage.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.920
Just eat a ghost.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.760
Yahoo is also standing by Richard Chachere.

49:09.160 --> 49:09.720
Thank you, Richard.

49:09.720 --> 49:12.200
It's by yahoo answers user Ari, who asks,

49:12.200 --> 49:14.680
can you get a DUI on a pair of Heelys?

49:16.440 --> 49:19.640
I've heard you can get a DUI on anything but your feet.

49:19.640 --> 49:23.000
Example, boat, bike, skateboard, rollerblades, et cetera.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.160
However, with Heelys, you're technically on your feet,

49:25.160 --> 49:26.360
but also on wheels.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.280
What is the true legal consequence of healing

49:28.280 --> 49:29.560
under the influence?

49:29.560 --> 49:35.240
Can you get a DUI on inline skates?

49:35.240 --> 49:36.760
Yeah, I think so.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.600
I think it's a state by state thing,

49:38.600 --> 49:42.760
but I think any mode of transportation will get you busted.

49:42.760 --> 49:44.760
I am deeply impressed by that,

49:44.760 --> 49:47.880
because I have worn rollerblades in my life,

49:47.880 --> 49:50.600
and I know what a difficult process it is

49:50.600 --> 49:53.480
to get them on your feet and then you stand up once more.

49:53.480 --> 49:54.520
You're gonna need stability.

49:54.520 --> 49:57.000
When me and Clint Wilson,

49:57.000 --> 49:58.920
we didn't have two pairs of rollerblades

49:58.920 --> 49:59.800
between us, we just had one,

49:59.800 --> 50:01.560
so we would do a pretty cool way

50:01.560 --> 50:03.720
of getting our tooling around town

50:03.720 --> 50:05.800
where we would both wear one shoe and one rollerblade

50:05.800 --> 50:07.000
and just kind of push ourselves on it

50:07.000 --> 50:07.960
like a shitty skateboard.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.040
That was a really cool look.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.960
Man, we got a lot of nucky.

50:19.240 --> 50:25.080
In West Virginia, Charleston guy got a DUI driving a tractor.

50:25.080 --> 50:29.160
Well, that's like if he fucking hits anybody in a tractor

50:29.160 --> 50:30.920
going any speed, that person's dead.

50:31.720 --> 50:34.760
He was driving on a highway from reserves at night.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.680
Well, that's, yes, I've been clearly,

50:36.680 --> 50:38.600
that's not for sure.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.320
Do you know what a cool night you have to have

50:41.320 --> 50:43.080
if you're like, you know what I'm gonna do?

50:44.280 --> 50:45.320
God, let's fire up that.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.000
Why do I only tractor sober?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.440
I'm gonna get some tractoring done.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.760
I did all the fucking corn.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.840
What if I just kept doing it?

50:53.720 --> 50:54.680
What if I just kept going?

50:54.680 --> 50:56.360
I'm gonna tractor this whole nation of ours.

50:56.360 --> 50:56.760
You know what?

50:56.760 --> 51:00.920
It's 2013 and my resolution was to stop limiting myself.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.600
I'm gonna tractor everything.

51:02.600 --> 51:03.640
I'm the modern day

51:03.640 --> 51:06.920
and also feloniously drunk Johnny Appleseed.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.200
But like the reverse Johnny Appleseed.

51:10.200 --> 51:10.680
But the reverse.

51:10.680 --> 51:11.640
Pairing stuff up.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.560
I'm just like running into buildings.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.000
I'm like a weird Johnny Appleseed Billy Joel hybrid.

51:18.440 --> 51:19.880
Johnny Billyseed.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.240
I'm Johnny Billyseed.

51:21.240 --> 51:25.880
This is a cool house.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.880
Now you're part of a great American legend.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.560
I destroyed your dining room

51:31.560 --> 51:33.160
but your front yard's good to go

51:33.160 --> 51:36.760
if you want to play on any corn or wheat or soybeans.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.000
This is actually a wonderful way to get your

51:39.000 --> 51:41.640
if you fuck up like super bad

51:42.280 --> 51:45.640
the only recourse you have is to continue fucking up

51:46.200 --> 51:50.120
so bad that you make that person part of an American legend.

51:50.120 --> 51:53.240
If you drag a giant ax through someone's house

51:53.240 --> 51:54.200
they're pissed.

51:54.200 --> 51:55.880
If you drive it through a hundred houses

51:55.880 --> 51:57.080
they're celebrities.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.200
Right, right.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.080
You think that the fucking people

52:01.880 --> 52:06.120
Billy Joel crashes his sedan into somebody's foyer

52:06.120 --> 52:07.880
and obviously they're they're woken up.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.040
They're startled and they go downstairs

52:10.040 --> 52:12.600
and Billy Joel steps out like I fucked up.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.520
I fucked up.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.960
They're like Billy it's okay.

52:17.960 --> 52:22.360
Hey Billy I'm gonna tell this story forever Billy.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.680
We're gonna be at a bar and piano man will come on.

52:24.680 --> 52:27.560
I could I could fuck anybody at that bar at that point.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.640
I can show you Billy Joel's car hole.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.360
I'm never fixing this shit.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.680
Come back to my place I can show you his car hole.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.080
I want to meet the guy who

52:41.400 --> 52:44.280
fucking steps out of his outside of the bar

52:44.280 --> 52:45.800
like thanks guys I had a fun night.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.720
Whee!

52:47.720 --> 52:48.680
And Heely's away.

52:49.560 --> 52:50.920
Heely's into the moon set.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.040
I would have to be drunk to wear Heely's

52:56.040 --> 52:57.960
to think I could pull that off actually.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.240
How do you how do you convince the cops

53:01.240 --> 53:02.440
you weren't wearing Heely's?

53:02.440 --> 53:04.360
Can you tell them like nah it's just ice.

53:04.360 --> 53:05.160
Nah they're just shoes.

53:06.680 --> 53:07.240
I'm wearing shoes.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.000
Can you walk the straight line?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.120
No I cannot.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.360
I was doing a perpetual Michael Jackson dance.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.160
I'm the greatest dancer.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.520
I'm pretty much the greatest dancer.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.120
Sir we could hear you wheeing all the way down the street.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.720
We know that you were wearing Heely's.

53:21.720 --> 53:22.360
I don't.

53:22.360 --> 53:23.320
I was parkouring.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.440
Yeah that's a DUI too.

53:24.440 --> 53:25.320
You can't parkour.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.080
You can't.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.360
What if you flip into traffic?

53:31.720 --> 53:35.080
What if you stunt like through an elementary school window?

53:36.920 --> 53:40.520
I have a problem with someone planning their weekend this thoroughly.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.040
I have a problem with so well.

53:42.040 --> 53:45.560
I'm gonna be wearing the Heely's for an earlier activity.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.840
Do I need to go home and change?

53:48.040 --> 53:49.240
I'm gonna get drunk.

53:50.840 --> 53:52.120
Here's the order of operations.

53:52.120 --> 53:54.440
I'm going to the skate park with my Heely's.

53:55.080 --> 53:57.160
I just assumed that that's where you stunt.

53:58.200 --> 53:58.920
I'm gonna drink.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.400
Do I need to work a home visit in there somewhere?

54:04.840 --> 54:06.680
Thank you so much for listening to our program.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.760
We hope you had a lot of fun listening to it.

54:08.760 --> 54:13.480
Want to say a quick thank you to people who've mailed us stuff through snail mail.

54:13.480 --> 54:18.520
Our address is P.O. Box 54 Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.400
Thank you to Julie Van Wye and Ian Van Wye.

54:21.400 --> 54:27.080
They sent us some pretzels that they baked themselves and sent along pictures.

54:27.080 --> 54:27.880
That's awesome.

54:27.880 --> 54:30.120
Oh I ate them with Sydney and they were so good.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.160
We got back from vacation.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.120
Did you eat all of them?

54:32.120 --> 54:34.280
It was the only thing in the house and we ate them all.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.400
You ate all of them?

54:35.400 --> 54:37.480
Just send us some more around the holidays so I can share.

54:37.480 --> 54:42.200
We got some beautiful yolo earrings with some one-up mushrooms on them.

54:42.200 --> 54:46.840
A postcard from what appears to be Dean Snodgrass that just says hey.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.560
We got an email from Jeanette.

54:49.560 --> 54:51.400
He's gonna fucking kill all three of us.

54:52.040 --> 54:52.760
I know.

54:52.760 --> 54:53.800
We got an email.

54:53.800 --> 55:00.040
We got a postcard from Maria that has a lenticular picture of Dawson City.

55:00.040 --> 55:00.680
That's beautiful.

55:01.720 --> 55:05.800
Our uncle Travelin' Matt sent us one from the Phoenix Art Museum.

55:05.800 --> 55:09.880
We got a postcard from another one from uncle Travelin' Matt from Colorado.

55:09.880 --> 55:10.600
He's on tour.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.560
A baby announcement.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.920
This is actually really good.

55:14.920 --> 55:20.520
We got a baby announcement from Joshua and Danielle that says we're thrilled to announce

55:20.520 --> 55:21.800
having a baby.

55:21.800 --> 55:25.480
Baby Cygnus expected due date is November 12th.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.720
Stay tuned for more information.

55:27.720 --> 55:32.040
And then here they have just handwritten mission accomplished.

55:33.960 --> 55:34.600
Pretty great.

55:34.600 --> 55:43.160
That's really got another great postcard from Stephanie and a lovely note from Ty Nielsen

55:43.160 --> 55:45.080
and so much more from her.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.800
A copy of Space Jam I think from Tyne.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.360
On DVD?

55:48.360 --> 55:48.440
I don't know.

55:48.440 --> 55:48.920
Ty Nielsen.

55:48.920 --> 55:49.480
Man, I love him.

55:49.480 --> 55:50.600
Is it out on Blu-Ray yet?

55:51.400 --> 55:58.440
It is a four pack in this box that includes Looney Tunes the movies, Looney Tunes Back

55:58.440 --> 56:04.920
in Action the movie, Space Jam, Osmosis Jones.

56:04.920 --> 56:06.680
That's a fucking great movie.

56:06.680 --> 56:14.840
And then what I can only assume is they just had this lying around and they wanted to toss

56:14.840 --> 56:15.400
it in.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.600
I want to see if you guys can see.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.360
I want to throw it up on my cam so you guys can see there.

56:20.360 --> 56:25.240
It's just called Funky Monkey and it's a picture of a monkey wearing headphones giving

56:25.240 --> 56:28.200
like a sort of like a DJ Tiesto fist bump.

56:28.200 --> 56:31.640
I think whenever they started putting this four pack together the people were like let's

56:31.640 --> 56:33.480
do a four pack because they were drunk.

56:33.480 --> 56:37.640
Let's do a four pack of movies with Bill Murray and cartoons and they were like there's

56:37.640 --> 56:39.240
only two of those like ah fuck it.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.120
What else we got?

56:40.120 --> 56:40.840
Funky Monkey?

56:40.840 --> 56:41.880
Sure, I guess.

56:41.880 --> 56:46.120
We got a lot of these leftover Funky Monkey DVDs from the MVP.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.640
Can we splice Bill Murray and also cartoons into that?

56:49.640 --> 56:54.680
I also want to say thank you again to Hulu Plus where you can binge on thousands of hit

56:54.680 --> 56:55.000
shows.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.320
They're supporters of the show.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.280
It's a great deal.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.240
Go check it out.

56:59.240 --> 57:04.200
Go to huluplus.com and just forward slash my brother for the extended free trial.

57:04.920 --> 57:05.960
Don't you slash me.

57:07.720 --> 57:08.600
Slash my brother.

57:11.160 --> 57:13.800
I want to throw out a special thanks to Allison Greenberg.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.160
She sent us an email with 50 yahoo answers in them.

57:19.320 --> 57:24.760
I didn't get time to do any of them on the show but I appreciate it must have taken like

57:24.760 --> 57:27.240
a week of preparation so thank you.

57:27.240 --> 57:30.680
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

57:30.680 --> 57:33.000
Is a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

57:34.440 --> 57:35.800
You can find it on iTunes.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.320
You can probably find it on Spotify.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.920
I'm not sure how much of a kickback he gets.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.880
I know that it's tricky with streaming, media rights.

57:43.880 --> 57:49.080
I know that Metallica has raised quite a stink about that very issue and so if by bringing

57:49.080 --> 57:53.320
up Spotify I've injured John Roderick's prospects I apologize.

57:53.320 --> 57:57.960
And on that grim note we're going to end this episode with a final question from

57:58.840 --> 58:00.120
young Griffin McElroy.

58:01.160 --> 58:03.560
This yahoo answer was sent in by Steven Isaacson.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.280
Thank you Steven.

58:04.280 --> 58:06.440
It's by yahoo answer user Cooper who asks.

58:08.200 --> 58:13.880
Is it true if you take a cop's badge that they're not a cop anymore and you're the cop?

58:16.920 --> 58:17.800
I'm Justin McElroy.

58:17.800 --> 58:18.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:19.960 --> 58:21.400
This has been my brother my brother and me.

58:21.400 --> 58:22.520
Kiss your dad.

58:22.520 --> 58:24.520
Square in the lips.
