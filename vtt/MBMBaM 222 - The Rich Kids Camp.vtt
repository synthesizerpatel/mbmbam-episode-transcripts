WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:50.880
It's the most wonderful time of the year. No, there's no movie watches.

00:50.880 --> 00:56.400
There's no holidays to report on. No friends, it's much better than that.

00:56.400 --> 01:05.680
It's Max Fun Week, a week-long celebration of all things related to the Maximum Fun Network.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.200
Now, I want to clarify here, because I've seen some people, you know, you talk about Max Fun Week,

01:09.200 --> 01:12.800
and everybody goes, oh, another pledge drive, but here's the thing.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.640
Shut the fuck up.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.560
Yeah, also, shut up, wiener.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.200
No, I'm towing a hard line. You just assume every holiday that we cook up and invent,

01:21.200 --> 01:26.560
is a ploy for us to get money from you, but no, I'll go eat a bag of butts.

01:26.560 --> 01:32.400
Yeah, sorry. Some things are just about human joy, creating human joy. That's where we're at,

01:32.400 --> 01:34.880
and that's what the Maximum Fun Network is all about, and that's what we're doing this week.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.520
There's been already a bevy, can I say a bevy?

01:37.520 --> 01:38.000
You can.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.240
Is that fair? A bevy of activities.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.640
A flurry.

01:42.640 --> 01:48.240
A flurry, I guess, yeah, you could go with that, as part of the Max Fun Week celebration,

01:48.240 --> 01:55.280
and there is more to come. Today, it's worth noting, is Share Your Favorite Episode Day,

01:55.280 --> 01:56.960
so pick your favorite Max Fun show.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.040
It's gonna be this one. I just know it's gonna be this one.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.480
It's gonna be this one, and share your favorite episode with somebody.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.480
Maybe you like it classic. Maybe Spaghetti Gatton's your favorite episode.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.000
Maybe you like one of the live ones. Those are the only two I can remember.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.760
Or maybe you're branching out, and you wanna say that your favorite episode is the episode

02:13.760 --> 02:17.520
of Jordan Jesse Go! I was on, or the episode of Lady 2 Lady I was on.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.400
Oh, wow.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.240
Branching out, but into very specific Travis-based directions.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.120
Or maybe the episode of Wham Bam Pow I was on.

02:25.120 --> 02:31.360
Oh, wow. Travis, are you the most prolific Maximum Fun guest, do you think, at this point?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.840
You think you've been on the most number of Maximum Fun shows?

02:33.840 --> 02:34.960
Let me think. Yes.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.160
Probably.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.960
I need to get on Sawbones. I need to find an N there.

02:38.960 --> 02:44.640
Yeah, good luck. Maximum Fun dot org, four slash Max Fun Week is where you can go to

02:44.640 --> 02:46.720
read all about the activities. There's still a lot more to come.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.000
There's also a, depending on when this publishes, oh, yeah, there'll be time.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.320
There is an Ask Me Anything with Jesse and Jordan at two.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.640
These are Pacific times, by the way, at two.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.480
Julie from Destination DIY is doing one at four.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.960
And Lisa and Emily from Baby Genius is doing one at six.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.760
So, get there.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.600
Which, by the way, if you haven't checked out the new shows,

03:08.160 --> 03:11.760
check out Destination DIY, check out Flophouse, and I'm now the producer

03:11.760 --> 03:14.560
for Baby Geniuses, so triple check that out.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.120
Whoa.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.120
What's with this, what's with, what's with your whole steez lately?

03:19.120 --> 03:22.240
Yeah, you're really getting, if I can say above your raisin,

03:22.240 --> 03:23.840
I feel like you're getting above your raisin right now.

03:23.840 --> 03:29.200
Listen, I'm elevated. I'm a new man. I'm on my grind. I'm on my grind.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.480
Driver's on his grind is the worst.

03:30.480 --> 03:35.200
Can we find a happy medium between Justin and I having no grind to speak of whatsoever

03:35.200 --> 03:37.520
and you having like an extreme grind?

03:37.520 --> 03:40.480
Do we need like a medium grind, like for drip coffee?

03:40.480 --> 03:45.760
Shouldn't you legally have to spend some of your grind, grinding for us? It seems like.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.920
I'm on that twerk. I'm on that twerk. I'm twerking, I'm twerking for my personal brand.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.000
Listen, listen.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.680
That's my butt cheeks.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.160
Is that your butt?

03:58.160 --> 03:59.920
That's your butt slapping against your butt.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.360
That's my butt cheeks clapping.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.840
For you, saying, hey, good job.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.360
For you, saying great job. You did a really great job on the one podcast you're on.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.760
That's not true. I'm actually on Judge John Hodgman this week.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.680
We've got a massive guest. Speaking of, we've got a massive guest.

04:13.680 --> 04:18.880
He is 900 feet tall and he's made entirely out of granite.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.440
It's Judge John Hodgman. That's going to happen soon, so get ready.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.520
I mean, Judge John Hodgman is a character that he plays.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.760
We got him. We went behind the scenes and we got the man behind.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.160
The man who's obsessed with Bowser from Sean on Off.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.120
Oh, guys.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.160
Stay tuned.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.040
Until then, let's do some questions and help some people.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.080
If somebody sneezes in the bathroom stall next to you, should you say bless you?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.960
I was recently in a bathroom and I sneezed.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.680
The other person in the stall did not say bless you.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.240
Okay, wait.

04:49.040 --> 04:54.480
I'm assuming that you don't mean in the stall with you because that would be rude.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.280
Someone in the stall touching me sneezed.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.560
Someone's staring at me, waiting to hand me a hot towel.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.120
Then I thought maybe I was being too judgmental.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.120
However, the lady didn't wash her hands.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.720
Three exclamation points.

05:06.720 --> 05:13.440
So I'm not really sure what the proper etiquette would be since this lady obviously didn't have any.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.720
That's from Megan.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.220
Well, I...

05:15.220 --> 05:22.320
First of all, Megan, I want to compliment you on your full in-depth study of this woman.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.880
She didn't say bless you, but she also didn't wash her hands, so it kind of balances out.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.520
We have been penalized so many times in this program for rushing to judgment,

05:31.520 --> 05:35.200
and I want to celebrate you for not doing that.

05:35.200 --> 05:41.840
You could have just said, wow, what a jerk, but you decided to go John Quinones

05:41.840 --> 05:46.480
and really explore the whole situation that this woman was encompassing,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.640
rather than just saying you're a bad person.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.040
You have a whole in-depth investigation, which I really celebrate.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.640
And it's really fortunate that you didn't rush to judgment and say this person is such a jerk

05:56.640 --> 05:58.880
because you would have been dead wrong.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.400
Griffin is correct.

06:00.400 --> 06:07.120
It is my opinion that when someone is inside the actual stall itself, they cease to exist to you.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.720
And it's weird, right?

06:08.720 --> 06:14.560
Because, and obviously I'm saying this as a dude,

06:14.560 --> 06:19.120
and this is not so much a thing that a woman would experience,

06:19.120 --> 06:23.840
but when you're next to each other at the urinal, it is a very communal place.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.480
It is a place of bonding and fellowship, I would say.

06:26.480 --> 06:32.400
And then in the stalls, you are buried 800 feet underground in a big, big safe.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.960
It is the reason that if I were out of sync

06:34.960 --> 06:38.960
and somebody asked me to hand them a paper towel, not a deal at all.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.280
But when someone asks for toilet paper,

06:41.280 --> 06:48.000
because it's this like, yes, for some reason.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.560
So it makes me, the very idea of it gives me heart palpitations.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.600
If you responded to that in any life situation,

06:55.600 --> 06:57.600
someone is going to try to put a spoon on your tongue,

06:57.600 --> 07:00.800
assuming that you're having a spoon.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.160
Why did I ask?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.200
Oh, curse me.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.560
You can't.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.960
You can't make any noise in there.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.280
It's a silent safe zone.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.960
It's practically a church.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.040
Upsetting conduct that I have witnessed, well, not witnessed obviously,

07:15.040 --> 07:19.600
but well, maybe, yeah, ear witnessed from people in stalls,

07:19.600 --> 07:25.840
but number one, and this one kills me, is the listening to music from your phone.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.800
While you're going for it.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.960
I was in a toilet at a restaurant the other day

07:30.960 --> 07:35.120
and I was in a stall next to a guy who was shopping for ringtones.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.560
It's pretty cool.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.600
It was a pretty cool scene.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.520
I mean, when the fuck else do you get?

07:43.520 --> 07:46.560
Justin, where do you find the time to build your personal brand?

07:46.560 --> 07:50.480
Yeah, try to figure out how you express yourself to the world.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.320
You're missing time.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.520
Where else are you going to shop for ringtones though, right?

07:55.520 --> 07:57.520
Like if you're hanging out with friends and loved ones,

07:57.520 --> 07:58.800
that's not a time to do it.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.520
You're at a picnic.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.600
No, I'm going to go play froth.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.640
I'm not going to shop for ringtones.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.760
It is a good point though.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.720
I think the only thing that would be more embarrassing to do in public

08:08.720 --> 08:12.160
than defecate would be to try to pick the ringtone

08:12.160 --> 08:14.800
that best fits your personal style.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.600
So stressful.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.960
I am honestly, I'm too embarrassed to do that anymore.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.560
I've got like a pretty standard issue beep going on now.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.240
I stumbled on in my last phone.

08:26.240 --> 08:37.200
I had the immortal Koji Kondo theme to the Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island theme.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.240
Fun little ditty.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.080
Nothing gets better than that though.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.640
One of the things I was most impressed by when I was in Scotland,

08:42.640 --> 08:45.040
I mean, along with the beautiful vistas and all of that,

08:45.040 --> 08:50.640
was that their bathroom stall doors close in such a way that there are no gaps.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.840
Like you can't see through them.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.680
Like you can't hear in Heathen America.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.480
But I've never witnessed any kind of soundproofing in a stall.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.160
And that's what you want.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.080
I would rather soundproof than sightproof those things.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.040
You know what I mean?

09:03.040 --> 09:04.080
Maybe some baffling.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.920
Some nice baffling.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.040
Oh, sure.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.560
Inexpensive acoustic treatment.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.920
I don't think that's too much to ask.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.720
No, now you will need to set fire to it once a day.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.920
And replace it.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.680
That phone.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.960
That phone remembers.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.840
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

09:20.720 --> 09:21.040
Yes.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.080
Absolutely.

09:22.080 --> 09:26.080
This one was sent in by Yadru Answers shaman Drew Davenport.

09:26.080 --> 09:26.880
Thank you, Drew.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.600
It's by Yadru Answers user, Emily, who asks,

09:31.680 --> 09:34.400
what can I be for Halloween at work?

09:34.400 --> 09:38.480
I have to wear my Papa John's shirt and hat, but not the pants.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.360
We can wear makeup.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.720
He was a pants-less employee.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.320
We can go as a fired employee.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.720
We could wear makeup or anything else.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.520
I also have the whiteout zombie contacts, too.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.120
What?

09:51.760 --> 09:54.160
One Yahoo Answers user named Liz responded,

09:54.160 --> 09:56.080
be a zombie and wear scary makeup.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.440
Thanks, you shithead.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.520
You don't think they looked at their constituent components

10:02.080 --> 10:04.640
of zombie eyes and scary makeup and didn't think,

10:04.640 --> 10:05.680
well, let's just do that?

10:06.560 --> 10:07.840
They're trying to think outside the bun

10:07.840 --> 10:11.600
and they're trying to fucking fold a no-pants situation in here.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
Or clever pants, right?

10:13.600 --> 10:16.160
Can you be Papa John's employee from the waist up,

10:17.040 --> 10:19.200
mandated by Papa John himself,

10:21.520 --> 10:23.200
but something else from the waist down?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.720
You could be like a pizza mermaid.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.080
Or pizza centaur, I think would be really great.

10:30.080 --> 10:30.880
Pizza centaur.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.560
Now you will need a friend for this.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.520
You will need a friend with eight hours to kill.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.880
And a strong back.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.080
It's very strong back.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.560
He's gonna be down by that pizza heat, too,

10:42.560 --> 10:44.400
so he needs to have a high tolerance.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.480
What if the pizza centaur was the one delivering the pizzas?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.960
That would be quite the show to see in your driveway.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.080
But they, I mean, they would eat it.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.840
Could you wear, could you find a friend who's a-

10:55.840 --> 10:57.040
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.880
Griffin, centaurs do not just eat any pizza

11:00.880 --> 11:01.680
put in front of them.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.320
Why would you assume that?

11:02.320 --> 11:02.880
They can't.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.800
They're fucking crazy for this one.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.520
No, they're very well-behaved.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.400
No, not around pizza.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.760
They're people just like us.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.440
Read my fucking novel.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.920
Read my young, my youth adult books.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.880
My youth adult books.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.560
Read Griffin's series of YA fiction, Cintines.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.720
The story of centaur teens trying to,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.760
who've traveled here from the Equestriaverse.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.160
The main character, Buck, is probably my favorite.

11:30.160 --> 11:30.480
Yeah.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.280
Oh God, guys, we're gonna lose the big skateboard meet.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.800
All right, get me skateboards.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.720
Two of them, because I got four legs.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.220
Whoa.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.220
Whoa.

11:40.420 --> 11:44.580
Did, could you ask a friend who works at Pizza Hut

11:44.580 --> 11:46.020
if you could borrow their pants?

11:46.020 --> 11:48.900
And then just everybody comes in and just be like, get it?

11:48.900 --> 11:49.700
Wait a minute.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.020
Do you get it?

11:52.020 --> 11:54.020
All right, can I get a personal pan pizza?

11:54.020 --> 11:55.380
Wait a minute, you don't do that here.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.500
I thought it was in Pizza Hut because of your crazy pants.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.540
What's going on here?

11:59.540 --> 12:00.580
Is this some sort of prank?

12:00.580 --> 12:01.940
Pizza pizza, right?

12:01.940 --> 12:02.660
Oh boy.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.180
You could dress up like, you could dress up your face

12:06.180 --> 12:08.100
like the guy in all the Papa John cover.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.060
Is his name just John?

12:09.060 --> 12:09.940
Can we establish what his fucking-

12:09.940 --> 12:12.420
No, I think his name is Papa John.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.380
It's John.

12:13.380 --> 12:14.820
I'm Papa John.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.060
You could dress up like that dude in the face department,

12:17.060 --> 12:21.140
which is to say like the most heavily caked on makeup

12:21.140 --> 12:23.940
you've ever seen on a dude on television.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.940
Oh my God, oh my God.

12:25.940 --> 12:29.620
His face extends out like four and a half extra inches

12:29.620 --> 12:31.060
from his regular face.

12:31.060 --> 12:35.220
He looks like he's wearing like one of those sad old clown masks.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.940
Oh, he's wearing like dark man skin.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.740
We obviously don't have as many like CEOs

12:40.740 --> 12:43.220
in their commercials I think as we used to.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.900
You know, you don't have the Dave Thomas's

12:44.900 --> 12:49.700
or Ron McDonald, not a lot in the commercials anymore.

12:52.340 --> 12:54.100
But don't you think that at a certain point

12:54.100 --> 12:56.020
you would be in enough commercials

12:56.020 --> 13:01.620
that you would achieve like a base level of competency

13:01.620 --> 13:03.060
with being in a commercial?

13:03.060 --> 13:06.500
Like at some point you would begin to grow

13:06.500 --> 13:07.860
as a commercial performer?

13:08.740 --> 13:10.740
I would argue that Papa John has gone

13:10.740 --> 13:12.500
the opposite direction.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.380
No, and I think that's just because he's resting

13:15.380 --> 13:17.060
more and more control with each commercial he's in.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.660
And I think very recently he became in charge

13:20.660 --> 13:22.660
of the makeup department and he says,

13:22.660 --> 13:23.860
I just want a little touch up.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.380
Also, can you make my eyes look like

13:25.380 --> 13:27.940
that crazy Richard Alpert guy from Lost?

13:27.940 --> 13:28.820
Terrific, thank you very much.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.820
Do you think maybe the problem is that when he's up there

13:30.820 --> 13:32.660
and he's performing with a heavy hitter,

13:32.660 --> 13:35.140
like a Peyton Manning, it's just really hard for him

13:35.140 --> 13:39.700
to like step up to that same level of acting proficiency?

13:39.700 --> 13:43.140
Yeah, that's exactly what Peyto is bringing to the mix.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.900
Peyton is another good example of somebody

13:44.900 --> 13:48.260
who is belligerently not getting any better

13:48.260 --> 13:49.620
at being in commercials.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.380
He's in every commercial and he refuses to learn anything.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.060
It's stubbornly bad.

13:55.060 --> 14:00.740
If I was in as many football matches

14:00.740 --> 14:03.140
as a Peyton Manning has been commercials,

14:03.140 --> 14:06.980
at this point I would be throwing the occasional INT,

14:06.980 --> 14:09.700
but I think I'd be putting up a decent fantasy performance.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.060
What if it's like when you're like an actor

14:13.060 --> 14:15.460
who's known for that and it's like he has improved,

14:15.460 --> 14:17.940
he's actually got like a degree from Juilliard now,

14:17.940 --> 14:20.020
but they're like, no, just be the Peyton

14:20.020 --> 14:21.300
for the Subway commercial.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.060
And he's like, but I really want to like expand.

14:23.060 --> 14:23.620
I want to like-

14:24.820 --> 14:27.940
If you insist, I shall put on the ruse.

14:27.940 --> 14:30.980
Come on down to Papa Job's pizza palace.

14:30.980 --> 14:33.060
Did you say pizza with a B?

14:33.060 --> 14:33.940
I don't know, man.

14:33.940 --> 14:34.660
Touchdown.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.820
Eli, come here and catch a fat slice.

14:38.820 --> 14:40.740
We don't like to call them fat slices.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.780
It's not appetizing verbiage, Peyto.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.420
Did you call it a pizza palace?

14:49.460 --> 14:49.960
Yep.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.460
I'm gonna get my whole, all my colts around.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.780
We're gonna slam some pizzas together.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.860
Here's your $5 million.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.220
Thank you very much.

14:59.220 --> 14:59.940
I needed that.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.940
I'll put it on top of the other $6 million

15:01.940 --> 15:04.500
that I earned this week for all my touchdown throws.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.940
And he thinks he still thinks he plays for the Colts?

15:07.940 --> 15:08.420
Yeah.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.020
That's upsetting too.

15:10.020 --> 15:12.260
That's the character of Peyton he plays on TV.

15:12.820 --> 15:13.700
Okay.

15:13.700 --> 15:17.380
Every horse-based team falls under a single umbrella for him.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.060
He did do that, didn't he?

15:19.060 --> 15:22.740
Yeah, this motherfucker's crazier about horses than we are.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.180
And I didn't think that was possible.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.100
What about the Washington Centaurs?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.500
I would root for that team hands down.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.900
You guys know that there's a team called the Washington Redskins.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.180
You heard about that, right?

15:32.180 --> 15:33.380
I've heard of it, yes.

15:33.380 --> 15:33.780
Okay.

15:33.780 --> 15:40.100
Do you know that I, the owner of a three and three fantasy football team,

15:40.740 --> 15:46.660
am not at this moment sure if that is Washington State or Washington DC?

15:46.660 --> 15:47.540
Here's the interesting fact.

15:47.540 --> 15:48.820
Hand to God, I don't know.

15:48.820 --> 15:49.780
It's a timeshare.

15:49.780 --> 15:50.580
It's both.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.020
It's both, Peyton.

15:52.020 --> 15:52.900
Okay.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.660
They're like sister city states.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.540
And they said like, we'll go in on this together

15:57.540 --> 16:00.580
because each of them couldn't afford a full team by themselves.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.260
So they split the cost right down the middle.

16:03.380 --> 16:07.460
How mad must Washington DC have been when they hurt?

16:07.460 --> 16:10.340
Because you know that news took a long time to travel back then.

16:11.140 --> 16:14.980
Those motherfuckers called the state what?

16:14.980 --> 16:16.820
They called it what?

16:16.820 --> 16:20.580
I wanted them to call it Oregon, but up some more.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.100
And that was my original name.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.180
I don't see what's wrong with Oregon, but up some more.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.700
But fine, fuck it, whatever.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.100
They called it Washington too, at least, right?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.820
My husband and I recently moved into our first home in a neighborhood

16:30.820 --> 16:33.460
that has a lot of elementary and middle school age kids.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.380
My memories of middle school suggest we should be at least a little on guard

16:37.380 --> 16:42.260
for mailbox bashing, TPed trees, and other mild hooliganism.

16:42.260 --> 16:46.500
How can we plan our candy costume or exterior decor situation to deter

16:46.500 --> 16:50.660
pranking if there is no stopping the tricksters,

16:51.380 --> 16:54.580
which we did prepare ourselves in our home for the aftermath?

16:54.580 --> 16:57.620
That's from please just take the candy and go.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.460
Can I say something?

17:00.260 --> 17:06.260
I feel like if your house gets forked, do you guys know about forking?

17:06.260 --> 17:07.780
No, I'm not aware of forking.

17:07.780 --> 17:09.300
You steal all your forks.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.860
No, you get a bunch of plastic forks and you like jam them into their yard.

17:12.580 --> 17:14.020
And kill all the groundhogs.

17:14.020 --> 17:18.180
No, no, no, it's not.

17:18.180 --> 17:21.060
It's just there's forks there now where there weren't forks before.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.100
Now there's forks.

17:22.100 --> 17:27.380
It's not just if you get forked or you get mailbox bashed or you get TPed or egged.

17:27.380 --> 17:32.740
I would consider that a refreshing spring breeze compared to like the game

17:32.740 --> 17:36.820
that teens are pulling down in today's modern era.

17:36.820 --> 17:37.300
You know what I mean?

17:37.300 --> 17:42.420
Like if I'm saying this Halloween, like people are going to go door to door

17:42.420 --> 17:46.100
and like fucking docks people and release their bank account number

17:46.100 --> 17:48.980
and like somehow get a picture of everyone's dicks

17:48.980 --> 17:52.340
and post it on your fucking next door forum board.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.740
And then that's that's the equivalent.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.940
That's where we're at nowadays.

17:55.940 --> 18:00.580
I'm saying that this mild hooliganism has turned into like full blown identity theft.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.180
In real life.

18:02.180 --> 18:05.780
I mean, in movies, they always show it being so like upsetting when someone gets TPed.

18:05.780 --> 18:09.620
But I think that like I think it's almost kind of flattering in a way.

18:09.620 --> 18:13.540
Because it's like, hey, you're involved in this now.

18:13.540 --> 18:14.500
So annoying.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.940
Have you ever had to get it off, though?

18:16.740 --> 18:17.940
Oh, no, you just leave it.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.900
Until the birds come get it.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.500
Oh, the birds take it away and build a nest.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.540
And they wipe their ass.

18:24.740 --> 18:25.700
Dirty birds.

18:25.700 --> 18:30.820
I really liked when a couple of kids who we did community theater with tried to TP our house

18:30.820 --> 18:35.540
and then Todd, our huge, huge, huge neighbor, yelled at them and chased them off.

18:36.580 --> 18:37.300
Take that kids.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.180
Take that little kids.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.220
Get out of here.

18:39.220 --> 18:44.420
Is giving away good candy still like a solid defense against this?

18:44.420 --> 18:47.540
But that's extortion at that point, right?

18:47.540 --> 18:48.580
You're giving into it.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.340
You're negotiating.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.260
You're negotiating with baby terrorists.

18:52.260 --> 18:56.500
You turn the extortion around and you say like, listen, I bought you full sized candy bars this

18:56.500 --> 18:56.820
year.

18:56.820 --> 18:57.620
Yeah, you enjoy that?

18:57.620 --> 18:58.260
You like that?

18:58.260 --> 18:59.940
Would you like this train to keep it rolling?

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
Well, I guess that's up to you.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.340
I think you're just perpetuating climate of fear.

19:04.340 --> 19:05.140
Still extortion.

19:05.140 --> 19:15.380
I would love to get egged if it meant I didn't have to get doxxed every fucking week and have

19:15.380 --> 19:21.380
to move every week and establish new passwords every week and just like explain to people,

19:21.380 --> 19:23.300
no, that's not my dick every week.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.660
That would be excellent if we could avoid that.

19:28.660 --> 19:31.780
That would be fantastic if we could just not have that for one.

19:31.780 --> 19:33.940
Just give me one week's respite, please.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.300
You should just talk to your neighbors and see if this is actually an issue because I'm

19:37.300 --> 19:40.980
willing to bet it's not as bad as you think it is.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.340
Keep a porch light on.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.100
Don't leave your pumpkin on the front porch.

19:45.460 --> 19:46.820
You know, I don't know.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.140
You're saying don't celebrate Halloween essentially.

19:49.140 --> 19:49.540
No, no, no.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.660
Just at the end of the night, like bring it inside.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.660
For some reason, that's the big concern to me.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.340
Someone might smash my pumpkin.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.860
I think they're doing you, if they do that after sugar treat, they're doing you a favor.

20:03.860 --> 20:04.660
I think.

20:04.660 --> 20:07.780
You know what's great in Austin is that they'll smash your pumpkin and then they'll start a

20:07.780 --> 20:09.060
compost heap in your front yard.

20:11.060 --> 20:11.780
So considerate.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.060
It's super considerate, yeah.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.180
Sinks like shit, though.

20:14.180 --> 20:14.900
You guys want a Yahoo?

20:15.620 --> 20:16.180
Absolutely.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.940
This Yahoo was sent in by Michael Allen.

20:19.940 --> 20:20.740
Thank you, Michael Allen.

20:20.740 --> 20:24.260
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mr. Lizards who asks,

20:26.420 --> 20:31.460
what should I name my new restaurant that only serves leftovers from other restaurants?

20:31.460 --> 20:34.820
I am hoping to open a successful restaurant and I just need a good name.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.860
Here's the concept.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.380
There's nothing better than eating a delicious meal at a nice restaurant and having enough

20:39.380 --> 20:41.060
to take home and eat later.

20:41.060 --> 20:41.560
Doubles.

20:42.740 --> 20:47.140
My restaurant will serve leftovers from other restaurants so you can experience that joy

20:47.140 --> 20:50.980
without the trouble of having to go to the other restaurant in the first place.

20:50.980 --> 20:55.540
I plan to offer a premium menu with options from places like Olive Garden, Applebee's,

20:55.540 --> 21:00.500
and Red Lobster, as well as value items like Pizza Hut pizza or Mcdonald's.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.700
Burgers and Fries.

21:01.700 --> 21:05.940
It is a very wise business model because I will not have the expense startup costs of

21:05.940 --> 21:06.980
ovens or grills.

21:08.020 --> 21:11.060
I'll just need an extra large walk-in cooler and a few microwaves.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.740
Here are some names I'm considering.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.700
Good Re- Good Re- Eats.

21:17.700 --> 21:18.740
Twice Baked.

21:20.020 --> 21:21.620
Lefto- Leftovers.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.900
This is my favorite so far.

21:23.620 --> 21:26.500
Please let me know if you need additional info to come up with a good name.

21:28.020 --> 21:28.980
The middle man.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.940
The middle man.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.300
That's not bad.

21:32.660 --> 21:33.780
Shloppy Seconds.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.620
Shloppy Seconds is pretty good too.

21:35.620 --> 21:36.980
Time slash money waster.

21:37.540 --> 21:41.220
Can we figure out if this is actually going to be a viable business decision?

21:41.220 --> 21:45.300
Because I at first blush I thought about it and I said well the the overhead there is

21:45.300 --> 21:50.580
going to be outrageous right you're you are you are spending more money on the food you're

21:50.580 --> 21:57.460
paying for other restaurants's labor right and then you're you're in the worst markup

21:57.460 --> 22:00.340
position you could possibly be but at the same time you're gonna fucking eat that stuff

22:00.340 --> 22:09.300
anyway so the thing the thing is the thing this question asker is missing the the core

22:09.300 --> 22:15.220
principle of why leftovers are so great because you pay for the meal once and you eat it twice

22:15.780 --> 22:22.100
it's not that the cold day old food is so much better than the new stuff but imagine

22:22.100 --> 22:28.740
actually introduced another set of hands someone else has touched this thing i it's it's it's

22:28.740 --> 22:35.140
i don't think it's a terrible idea and here's why my favorite food items at restaurants across the

22:35.140 --> 22:40.340
the great city of austin texas uh are just that all across the great city of austin texas if i

22:40.340 --> 22:46.820
could bring them all together into one super restaurant oh fuck yeah oh man get my favorite

22:46.820 --> 22:52.180
dessert from from from the salty sal and get some some sushi from uchiko man actually you don't

22:52.180 --> 23:00.260
really want no secondhand but let me poke a few holes in this plan one like okay so say you want

23:00.260 --> 23:06.980
a ten dollar hamburger from tgi friday's right if this place has that they're going to have to

23:06.980 --> 23:13.860
charge you more so you're going to be paying more for older food no no you're then how are they

23:13.860 --> 23:17.860
going to make money no no you're missing you're misunderstanding i go to tgi here's here's the

23:17.860 --> 23:22.100
business model i go to tgi friday's i get my favorite ten dollar burger in the world and i

23:22.100 --> 23:28.980
eat half of it and then i take that to the to sloppy seconds and maybe they give me 250 for it

23:28.980 --> 23:35.780
then they reheat it resell it for seven it's like a food pawn shop i would insist on consignment

23:35.780 --> 23:41.620
though yeah can i come back and get the rest of the burger later you hold on this burger for 30

23:41.620 --> 23:47.700
days the only uh one of the advantages i could see to sloppy seconds would be that i could buy

23:48.500 --> 23:54.740
chick-fil-a with a clean conscience they have filtered the hate through sloppy seconds although

23:54.740 --> 24:00.900
the owner of this place is probably a hateful person too let's be honest but i i could filter

24:00.900 --> 24:06.100
it i could have some plausible deniability there it was already bought well this is from oh my god

24:06.100 --> 24:12.500
i had no i i mean it did taste like soggy like pickle chicken so i should have known i'm just

24:12.500 --> 24:17.380
picturing a desperate person like at the counter saying because these are good french fries man

24:17.380 --> 24:21.700
these are good friends i paid top for these french fries and there travis you've just pulled

24:21.700 --> 24:25.780
the linchpin out and the whole thing just fucking fell apart because this restaurant cannot possibly

24:25.780 --> 24:32.100
under any circumstances sell french fries just can't exactly can't be done and old nachos old

24:32.100 --> 24:37.380
nachos especially no no and french fries no the whole thing is just terrible

24:39.460 --> 24:43.060
i would probably eat there you probably would because you're a fucking

24:43.060 --> 24:46.340
sarlacc in the shape of a man you're a sarlacc and cowboy boots

24:47.540 --> 24:49.540
uh can we go ahead and go the money zone i think we should

24:49.540 --> 25:04.420
good news mr rough face i really i've asked you several times to stop calling me that it's not

25:04.420 --> 25:09.940
my it's hurtful there's one solution though uh for your rough face you don't even only one

25:10.660 --> 25:17.220
finally good news everyone someone invented the razor my brother my brother and me is

25:17.220 --> 25:24.980
supported by harry's.com the place that invented finally the razor i don't think that's 100%

25:24.980 --> 25:32.260
true harry's delivers a better by which i mean first shaving experience for a fraction of the

25:32.260 --> 25:37.460
price of their competitors of which there are none so did they name them after the fucking scooters

25:37.460 --> 25:46.420
then yes named after the popular yet defunct method of transport teen transportation uh the

25:46.420 --> 25:52.740
company makes amazing german engineered uh razors i don't know why we have to specify

25:52.740 --> 25:59.780
german engineered as they're the only uh items of their kind i myself have shaved with uh the

25:59.780 --> 26:06.660
world's first razor and i can say that it was a smooth shaving experience actually you know what i

26:06.660 --> 26:13.300
got uh this week they sent harry sent me some uh some additional shaving products there was some

26:13.300 --> 26:17.940
aftershave lotion from harry's which i've never tried before and i actually used this morning

26:17.940 --> 26:22.660
and i found the scent delectable so you're saying i no longer just have to burn all the hair off

26:22.660 --> 26:28.500
my face every other day no don't get that that comically oversized magnifying glass out to try

26:28.500 --> 26:34.020
to burn individual hairs like so many ants crawling across the scape of your visage but i

26:34.020 --> 26:38.180
kind of like i kind of like the way it feels now would you say it works better than wishing the

26:38.180 --> 26:44.900
hair off yes it does it works better than all other methods this is a how does it work well

26:44.900 --> 26:54.260
here let me describe it for 15 you will get a uh a stick uh-huh you will get some cream okay you'll

26:54.260 --> 26:59.220
put the cream on your face you will get it's flammable cream and it helps burn the hair no

26:59.220 --> 27:06.900
it's not in any way playable you'll get three sharp metallic wishing cream wishing cream smear

27:06.900 --> 27:16.900
it on your face it's a wishing cream by men and there's no wishing cream uh this is wishing

27:16.900 --> 27:23.540
cream by men and i fucking brought it off my tv once i think that that is a competing shave

27:23.540 --> 27:27.700
place that you probably shouldn't mention in a harry's ad oh can i what if i say it sucks dick

27:28.980 --> 27:35.620
what doesn't exist in the fiction of the ad you for 50 you get a handle a stick to put the sharp

27:35.620 --> 27:42.820
things on you get three blades which are sharp metallic like flat things that you scrape across

27:42.820 --> 27:47.540
your face and it makes the hair die like railroad rails they're like flat railroad rails that you

27:47.540 --> 27:54.580
scrape across your face 15 bucks for that and you get three different blades so the the one downside

27:54.580 --> 28:00.500
of razors that they're hoping to fix in the coming months is that they eventually dull over time but

28:00.500 --> 28:05.460
there are three blades now so you can swap them out once they get a little dull and you don't get

28:05.460 --> 28:09.700
that smooth shaving experience and they even offer custom engraving so you can get the handle of your

28:09.700 --> 28:16.340
razor engraved with your initials it's convenient and it's easy to order online go to harry's.com

28:16.340 --> 28:21.780
and use the promo code my brother all one word and harry's is going to give you five dollars off

28:21.780 --> 28:27.780
your first purchase of the first razor for all my brother my brother me listeners what a deal we

28:27.780 --> 28:33.220
also are sponsored this week by prosper who has sponsored us before and it's a super cool idea in

28:33.220 --> 28:37.780
my opinion and basically what it is you go to prosper.com it's a peer-to-peer lending site

28:38.740 --> 28:43.780
so the idea is is that rather than go to a bank rather than go to some big faceless bank that

28:43.780 --> 28:48.580
doesn't give two shits about you you go to prosper.com and it's other people just like you

28:49.220 --> 28:55.060
lending you the money my bank said they love me your bank does not love you they love you like

28:55.060 --> 29:03.060
like a grain in the ocean they don't give two literal shits about you but you can borrow up

29:03.060 --> 29:07.620
to thirty five thousand dollars from prosper but here's the thing they also do smaller loans too

29:07.620 --> 29:11.620
because if you're like me you think about the thirty five thousand and that's like an astronomical

29:11.620 --> 29:17.380
imaginary number but they also do as low as twenty five hundred dollars so anywhere in

29:17.380 --> 29:22.740
between that you can apply for those loans maybe you know banks give out lots of home loans they

29:22.740 --> 29:27.300
give lots of car loans but maybe you're looking for something to pay off a medical bill maybe

29:27.300 --> 29:30.900
you're wanting to go on a vacation maybe you're needing to pay for a honeymoon or a wedding

29:31.460 --> 29:36.900
or you've got moving expenses or anything like that that maybe a bank would say well that's not

29:36.900 --> 29:42.100
really the kind of thing we do well prosper does we love we love you though like i'll

29:43.620 --> 29:49.780
don't love you like i'll fucking buy that again they wish you were dead and here's the thing you

29:49.780 --> 29:54.980
can apply online you never have to set foot in a bank you just go to prosper.com apply online you

29:54.980 --> 30:00.100
can check your rate instantly without affecting your your credit then go to prosper.com slash

30:00.100 --> 30:05.620
my brother if you get a loan you get fifty dollar gift card check it out you want to do uh you want

30:05.620 --> 30:12.500
to do this in the style of jimmy buffett maybe just like how you think he talks give me one

30:12.500 --> 30:22.100
second are you getting a guitar son of a bitch other restrictions apply see your site for

30:22.100 --> 30:29.860

30:34.420 --> 30:44.820
bank all personal loans are made by web banking utah chartered industrial bank member fdic equal

30:44.820 --> 30:51.060
opportunity lender i think i think wasted away again and needing moneyville

30:54.340 --> 30:57.620
going to prosper to get some dough

30:57.620 --> 31:08.340
some people claim that i'm not worth the risk and they're right

31:10.580 --> 31:12.020
i'm not worth the risk

31:14.900 --> 31:22.420
all right so and we're gonna just keep on we're gonna get through all this together

31:22.420 --> 31:28.340
um got a message for the cutie patootie with a rockin booty oh somebody's reaching out to me

31:29.060 --> 31:37.860
talk to me this message is for justin uh uh it's from luke aka pajama rye you know that name that

31:37.860 --> 31:44.740
you two have for him justin cute beauty no i'm not the cutie patootie with a rockin booty no

31:44.740 --> 31:51.060
it's actually rosio domo luke says to rosio domo you thought i couldn't outdo last year's present

31:51.060 --> 31:57.060
of infiltrating chinatown and buying pokemon x and y before the street date well bam here's our

31:57.060 --> 32:03.220
favorite brothers breaking the street date on our love people may mistake us for siblings on the reg

32:03.220 --> 32:09.620
but we should probably still make out catch you later banana mater catch you later banana mater

32:09.620 --> 32:15.140
i did it faster that time and are you ready to have your minds blown we are delivering this on

32:15.140 --> 32:22.020
the day oh nice um well don't say that because we're recording this pretty far ahead of time

32:22.020 --> 32:26.100
and i mean no it's correct on the 20th we're not just i'm just saying anything could happen

32:26.740 --> 32:33.300
okay well happy uh what's that anniversary love is that what it is birthday birthday all right well

32:33.300 --> 32:39.940
that's good whatever i'm not sure it's one of those things it's unclear happy celebration birthday

32:39.940 --> 32:45.380
it's last year's present so i don't know it's i don't know the occasion i'm saying this luke sounds

32:45.380 --> 32:55.060
like a uh no you just read ahead didn't you we're gonna get to that but don't don't rain on luke

32:56.100 --> 33:03.060
and cutie patootie's parade um i think it sounds like luke is a kind of a no limit soldier because

33:03.060 --> 33:10.340
he he could have gone to pokemon jail for breaking that street date yeah and it's hard in there geo

33:10.340 --> 33:15.940
dude doing pull-ups but you can wear shorts you can they're comfortable and easy that is true

33:15.940 --> 33:21.540
justin go ahead and i mean you ruined the fucking go ahead and read it justin who is this message

33:21.540 --> 33:27.140
for tom reagan who's this message from future tom reagan what is your message having two dicks

33:27.140 --> 33:38.580
turned out really great how far in the future is tom reagan is it is it is this a minority report

33:38.580 --> 33:45.940
situation did a pre did a pre-cock god step forward and and reveal to him an ill omen because

33:45.940 --> 33:53.540
this is it's from future not present day tom to past tom this is future tom to present day tom

33:53.540 --> 33:59.380
and it's not past tom or current tom reaching out to future tom asking about two dicks uh-huh

34:00.100 --> 34:07.540
because somewhere in the future tom has achieved or had added two dicks it turned out really great

34:07.540 --> 34:12.740
so present tom if you're listening and you're debating a major dick decision i think you know

34:12.740 --> 34:19.940
which way to go is this coded i hope not you just hope it's you're taking a face value his face is

34:19.940 --> 34:24.740
the least of his concerns right now sure having two dicks could have gone either way but it turned

34:24.740 --> 34:31.460
out really great mark your calendars for a brand new thing the first ever max fun week is coming up

this is john hodgeman in new york city i have profound affection for all three of you

35:09.540 --> 35:14.260
and i think that i figured out which one belonged to which name about one year ago

35:14.260 --> 35:22.260
oh and and or maybe even six months ago i think i asked jesse could you just walk me through it

35:22.260 --> 35:26.340
and he sat me down he sat me down in some in front of some headshots and we got it done

35:27.380 --> 35:33.940
but you just barely beat out our dad actually i have no i have no no visual to go with your

35:33.940 --> 35:39.540
voices so if i get confused between who's talking i apologize john you can picture me however you

35:39.540 --> 35:47.220
want that was travis nailed it that all right that last one was justin wow and then wow that

35:47.220 --> 35:52.260

35:53.620 --> 35:56.580
yeah that's that's baritone for the mcelroy brothers yes

35:59.140 --> 36:01.380
and here's griffin on the bass sing mr baseman

36:01.380 --> 36:12.100
ow i'm sorry to have brought up mr baseman so quickly but gentlemen how swiftly can we move

36:12.100 --> 36:18.180
into the eternal mystery of sha na na on this program because this is i got home from my night

36:18.180 --> 36:27.940
shoot on a on a non-television program at uh at 1 a.m and and and with the intention of eating

36:27.940 --> 36:33.300
seven slices of pizza and going to bed immediately and while i got the seven slices of pizza down

36:33.300 --> 36:41.140
i then had to go into a deep sha na na hole because my good friend david reese had had finally

36:41.140 --> 36:45.620
uh convinced me not he didn't he convinced me at the beginning but i finally got around

36:45.620 --> 36:52.820
to on his recommendation to listening to the great uh andy daley uh podcast project episode

36:52.820 --> 37:00.660
wolfman hot dog which involves andy daley's character famous waterskier hot dog largely

37:00.660 --> 37:05.540
talking about his obsession with sha na na and i had not thought about sha na na in a long time

37:05.540 --> 37:09.940
and now that is all i can think about so i apologize in advance well and now you spread

37:09.940 --> 37:15.700
that through the consciousness of our millions of of fans yeah into that you've you've injected

37:15.700 --> 37:22.740
your serum into the hive mind yeah what is your listenership is uh is fantastic it's it's something

37:22.740 --> 37:28.660
it's 35 million is that correct at this time it was 30 it's 36 million this week we had a we had

37:28.660 --> 37:32.900
a really bang up thanks it really turned around since we let chuck lorry take the show over wow

37:32.900 --> 37:43.220
well good for you uh good for you we're joined by john hodgeman uh this is my brother my brother

37:43.220 --> 37:49.380
me and rather than uh you know just spout on prattle endlessly we thought we oh are we going

37:49.380 --> 37:56.260
to try it differently this week yeah we probably let an actual expert oh uh answer questions uh

37:56.260 --> 38:02.980
the submitted by you the people uh have we established just a real ish have we established

38:02.980 --> 38:08.340
and and forgive me no for this horrible this horrible horrible thing but the area of your

38:08.340 --> 38:14.100
expertise my name is john hodgeman i host the judge john hodgeman podcast which is another

38:14.100 --> 38:19.300
less popular podcast on the maximum fun network that's not true i have numbers that say that's

38:19.300 --> 38:24.420
that's not true at all quantitatively you haven't seen my numbers well look there are different

38:24.420 --> 38:30.020
numbers that can be counted what are numbers and there are three of you and there's one of

38:30.020 --> 38:35.060
me so that makes you more popular i think well yes well we have to split ours three ways though

38:35.060 --> 38:41.620
well look another podcast on the maximum fun network and i i'm also uh well i have had a

38:41.620 --> 38:46.420
lot of jobs over the past six years much and all of them to my surprise i was on the daily show and

38:46.420 --> 38:51.220
continue to be on the daily show from time to time as a contributor as the resident expert and

38:51.220 --> 38:55.380
deranged millionaire on the daily show with john stewart i was in a series of computer ads for apple

38:55.380 --> 39:02.100
computer uh which was such a wonderful job that ended now uh 35 years ago today isn't that weird

39:02.100 --> 39:10.100
wow i'm currently i'm currently a recurring character on the fx comedy married and uh and uh

39:10.100 --> 39:15.380
and i was working last night on a different uh television slash non-television program i guess

39:15.380 --> 39:20.820
and a founding member of movement chance right oh if only if only it were true i did not mean

39:20.820 --> 39:26.900
to intimate that our listeners did not know who you are or your your storied body of work i was

39:26.900 --> 39:34.660
more suggesting your your the things which people walk up i walk up to you on the street yeah um uh

39:34.660 --> 39:42.020
which is a very unlikely scenario and i say hello mr hodgeman and your brilliance blinds me

39:42.020 --> 39:49.700
for a moment and and then i and then i would imagine my pepper spray does yes um and i say

39:49.700 --> 39:56.340
i need you to assist me with blank right i'm just assuming it's everything at this point

39:56.340 --> 40:02.500
well i did write a series of books of complete world knowledge and fake trivia and uh and all

40:02.500 --> 40:08.900
based on my uh universal knowledge of uh everything i have made up which is largely

40:08.900 --> 40:14.660
largely based on all of the shrapnel of trivia and small weird little facts that have accrued

40:14.660 --> 40:20.820
in my brain over these 43 years and you griffin are but a child right you are 17 19 years old 13

40:20.820 --> 40:29.380
13 years old big first age whoa whoa easy there big brothers just ribbon i understand but tell me

40:29.380 --> 40:37.940
your actual chronological age uh 27 uh gregorian years yeah you're so you know we all we all pick

40:37.940 --> 40:43.460
up and accrue a lot of weird facts over our years and as we get older and weirder we tend to spout

40:43.460 --> 40:48.740
them with even more and more authority when i was your age i was acting like a 35 year old now i'm 43

40:48.740 --> 40:55.860
and i'm acting like a man um sniffing the air coming up from his grave but as it is

40:58.260 --> 41:02.100
i can help the youths of today because of the experience i've had as an

41:02.100 --> 41:10.340
as a as a famous minor television personality internet judge uh and uh father and um and long

41:10.340 --> 41:17.060
time uh monogamist we actually we actually this may surprise you john we pull down a very mature

41:17.060 --> 41:21.620
crowd we pull down the the like the berks law audience you know it's basically our main

41:21.620 --> 41:25.860
cross-section you know what i love about your show is that you start out by saying this is

41:25.860 --> 41:33.780
not for kids and then you just swear and swear and swear and it it's liberate it's it's it's

41:33.780 --> 41:40.980
liberating it's it's freaking liberating i dare say uh all right john time to put your um your

41:40.980 --> 41:45.620
wisdom to the test with these uh hit questions from our listeners because they are correct answers

41:45.620 --> 41:50.980
there are correct answers to these here comes the first one i recently grew out a mustache it's not

41:50.980 --> 41:55.300
quite as impressive as your own masterpiece but i think it works the problem is i keep getting

41:55.300 --> 42:00.260
this paranoid feeling that everyone around me thinks it's meant ironically can i stop for a

42:00.260 --> 42:08.100
second did you say did you did you say masterpiece i said masterpiece i i wish i said mouthster

42:08.100 --> 42:12.980
piece mouthster piece would be right uh do you have any tips for making it obvious that the lip

42:12.980 --> 42:18.740
hair is sincere or two getting over this feeling and not giving a shit that's from hunter well no

42:18.740 --> 42:26.820
i mean the the the exercise of growing facial hair is a existential exercise as much as it is

42:26.820 --> 42:33.460
physical exertion at least for me that counts as physical exertion three hours a day just flexing

42:33.460 --> 42:39.700
your upper lip yeah it it you what you what you appreciate when you grow a mustache is that um

42:39.700 --> 42:46.980
um you are repulsing everyone even even even the people who love you the most the people who love

42:46.980 --> 42:53.540
you the most will be the most uh repelled by by your hideousness because they knew they knew

42:53.540 --> 42:59.060
the the best version of you which is to say pre-mustache this they certainly knew the

42:59.060 --> 43:04.740
smoothest most baby-like version of you and i know you brothers all rock a bunch of different

43:04.740 --> 43:12.020
facial hair configurations and so you know that the mustache in particular despite pockets of

43:12.580 --> 43:18.740
of mustachism and in in very in various college educated parts of brooklyn and austin texas i

43:18.740 --> 43:24.820
dare say where it is where it is being celebrated like a like a like a like a pre-prohibition

43:24.820 --> 43:34.420
cocktail which is to say loathsomely the mustache is is large is largely a sim a symbol of of

43:34.420 --> 43:43.300
middle age uh um resignation yeah sure yeah quitting is right middle age quitting

43:44.260 --> 43:50.420
and and growing one the process of growing one is a is a hideous thing to watch and then when it

43:50.420 --> 43:58.260
becomes fully uh ripened it is no better um and so what you do when you grow a mustache is that you

43:58.260 --> 44:07.460
are undertaking a profoundly selfish journey uh to see to see what there is inside of you at least

44:07.460 --> 44:15.220
behind your upper lip i'm trying to imagine i'm trying to imagine you in that that uh pupation

44:15.220 --> 44:19.380
phase and i don't want to even try and guess what it is for you because it's different for everybody

44:19.380 --> 44:25.220
right for sam elliot it's it's 45 seconds for michael sarah it's been it's just it's

44:25.220 --> 44:31.940
just been going it's just been going for a long time i i cannot imagine you in did you cloister

44:31.940 --> 44:37.780
yourself for the the period of time in which you were you had a um what what we affectionately call

44:37.780 --> 44:43.540
a stender stash uh because it is the type of mustache of the a gentleman uh that you might

44:43.540 --> 44:49.540
see in the west end of huntington west virginia hang on what when you had a halfway must when you

44:49.540 --> 44:54.180
had a halfway what is the derivation of you know i understand the question but i think a west ender

44:54.180 --> 44:59.140
a west ender okay a standard stash all right i thought i can actually answer this one for john

44:59.140 --> 45:04.260
thank you you saw john hodgeman when he had he has been posting to instagram updates of his

45:04.260 --> 45:11.780
mustache growth yeah this is a timely conversation because in in a in a fit of good taste uh i

45:11.780 --> 45:20.020
irrationally shaved off all of my facial hair um just one week and a half ago and uh and it was

45:20.020 --> 45:26.340
interesting because i i i thought well you know i i deployed every every follicle that i could over

45:26.340 --> 45:32.740
the summer because i am like i am like a stender do you know what i mean you know a huntington west

45:32.740 --> 45:39.300
virginia by any chance i've heard of it so you know what a stender is yes absolutely that's i

45:39.300 --> 45:43.620
should mention that our 36 million listeners are all based in in huntington west virginia so

45:43.620 --> 45:50.180
it's it's it's really it's really they all they all are based there but they live elsewhere

45:51.940 --> 45:55.540
they come back on monday they come back to listen to our live recording of the podcast

45:56.500 --> 46:03.380
i grow a terrible i grow a terrible beard and i was away with my family uh for most of the summer

46:04.660 --> 46:10.340
outside of civilization which is to say in maine and i therefore decided to deploy every follicle

46:10.340 --> 46:15.460
that i could just to see who was lurking inside of me and it turned out to be the it guy from

46:15.460 --> 46:21.460
the church of satan and everyone got really upset everyone my family got really upset with me and

46:21.460 --> 46:26.020
so i decided well you know it's been a long time i'll definitely shave off the beard and since it's

46:26.020 --> 46:31.140
been now almost four years since i've had a mustache i don't want to feel dependent upon it

46:31.140 --> 46:35.140
certainly i want to see i want to see who's in there you know who's who's behind who's behind

46:35.140 --> 46:41.300
the curtain of hairs and i feel like that i feel like that idea of the summer camp facial hair

46:41.300 --> 46:49.620
experience is a is a very uh um universal one so much so that i actually applied for a job at a

46:49.620 --> 46:56.980
summer camp when i was in high school uh and the application expressly forbade uh the facial hair

46:56.980 --> 47:02.100
experiment right it expressly for and i'm not sure this is not a joke it literally said on the

47:02.100 --> 47:07.780
application that if you are coming in without facial hair this is now a canvas on which now

47:07.780 --> 47:13.860
is facial experimentation yeah exactly we expect you to haze each other and and question your

47:13.860 --> 47:20.580
sexuality and and and have and do experiments in human cruelty here at camp but no creeps please

47:20.580 --> 47:25.140
and be sure to meet the kids from the jock camp across the lake do you want to know something

47:25.140 --> 47:31.940
dodgeball fight we were so we were we were in in maine vacation land usa they they called it

47:31.940 --> 47:37.140
vacation land that's what it's that's on the license plates and i figured out oh they they

47:37.140 --> 47:42.980
they in 1820 when they invented maine they called it vacation land because they hadn't figured out

47:42.980 --> 47:49.860
what a vacation is yet sure because they couldn't call it america's canada right exactly but so

47:49.860 --> 47:56.580
my human son went to went to a camp on a lake a day camp and one and one day i was driving home

47:56.580 --> 48:05.060
and he goes those kids across the lake at that other camp are such snobs and i'm like what he's

48:05.060 --> 48:12.180
like yeah that's the rich kids camp and they are snobs did you just covertly get a small video

48:12.180 --> 48:17.780
camera out and start your your found footage uh camp movie yeah yeah and that's how we that's how

48:17.780 --> 48:26.660
we ended up driving off the road because i got on my but you know my my son uh is uh is nine years

48:26.660 --> 48:32.740
old and has never seen meatballs he's never seen any of those movies i don't know where this is

48:32.740 --> 48:38.900
coming from and what's interesting is at no point did i ever believe that it could be true that there

48:38.900 --> 48:44.980
was a rich kids camp across the lake it was too on the nose i thought some of the older counselors

48:44.980 --> 48:53.300
were gaslighting the kids there there have to be some sort of zoning laws about camp to camp

48:53.300 --> 48:59.220
proximity that someone saw meatballs and said no this cannot this cannot come to pass somebody saw

48:59.220 --> 49:04.260
heavyweights and said we can't let the fat camp be close to the skinny camp no no no no no no

49:04.900 --> 49:11.780
heavyweights now you're now i'm gonna be up all night researching that thank you for getting

49:11.780 --> 49:18.260
shunned on out of my mind but it turns out there is there's a rich kids camp across the lake and

49:18.260 --> 49:26.820
it is like the richest of rich kids camp it is like the the sons of roy of middle eastern royalty

49:27.380 --> 49:31.540
now is it possible that those kids are all actually really thoughtful and nice but everyone's

49:31.540 --> 49:36.500
just like but they're snobs such snobs and the kids are really giving and sweet and like caring

49:36.500 --> 49:41.060
what no no because what i mean i'm sure that there are some of them there there's there's a

49:41.060 --> 49:48.340
good egg in every camp full of middle eastern princes but the old adage but i asked around town

49:48.340 --> 49:54.580
they're like yeah those kids are monsters they all they wear matching they wear matching purple

49:54.580 --> 50:00.580
tracksuits oh the worst and they're constantly going through town and causing trouble and then

50:00.580 --> 50:07.460
and then they have huge luxury motor coaches that take them on on trips to acadia national park and

50:07.460 --> 50:12.340
such and at the end of each year they burn an owl in effigy yeah and they return to their business

50:12.340 --> 50:17.860
jobs yes it's a it's the place where the the the son of a of a white man who went to yale university

50:17.860 --> 50:27.300
can feel like a working stiff so anyway to answer your question here's the thing next question

50:27.300 --> 50:32.580
here's the thing your mustache is going to look bad for a while and then it will be a mustache

50:32.580 --> 50:40.340
and will continue to look bad well let me just say a mustache over a beard is is more provocative

50:40.340 --> 50:47.620
than a beard the only facial hair configuration that i think invites more derision and confusion

50:47.620 --> 50:53.700
would be an amish neck beard and nothing else which i'm working on next but all of this facial

50:53.700 --> 50:58.980
hair is is basically an invitation to the world to make a bunch of dumb cracks you can't control

50:58.980 --> 51:03.780
what they're going to think about your face any more than you can control what they're going to

51:03.780 --> 51:10.180
think about your face and it is exactly what you suspect it is a journey into self-confidence

51:10.180 --> 51:17.380
where you realize my face and is is more important than or what i want to do with my face is more

51:17.380 --> 51:21.620
important than what other people think of me and i will take comfort in the fact that i will be

51:21.620 --> 51:26.260
totally alone and no one will kiss me or love me for a period of time i'll shave your basketball

51:26.260 --> 51:32.100
number in the back of your head bonk this is almost that that bit was almost one of those

51:32.100 --> 51:36.980
dove commercials that always go viral that's like you are beautiful don't let anybody tell you any

51:36.980 --> 51:40.420
differently i thought this was going to be our hit and then travis comes in with the basketball

51:40.420 --> 51:44.180
number shit and then we lost it forever i thought we're probably going to inspire some people i'm

51:44.180 --> 51:49.300
moving on to a new question and please can i just clarify i'm not saying that anyone is beautiful

51:49.300 --> 51:54.660
i'm just saying oh no you know we're all we're all pretty we're all pretty ugly in different

51:54.660 --> 52:00.260
ways the ones who are ugly on our faces are tend to be the lucky ones i have been a bookseller for

52:00.260 --> 52:05.780
seven years not me this is the question yeah and i think my next i thought i thought you

52:05.780 --> 52:15.940
were asking me to euthanize you and i think my next career step is probably either working at

52:15.940 --> 52:21.140
a publisher or a literary agent so your first instinct wasn't too far off as a former terribly

52:21.140 --> 52:26.420
famous professional literary agent do you have any suggestions on how to start are there courses

52:26.420 --> 52:30.580
i should go back to school for do you just start in the mail room and see if anything opens up

52:30.580 --> 52:36.020
i also have amicable relationships with a few decently well-known authors within my favorite

52:36.020 --> 52:40.740
genre would say getting character references from them on my resume made me more enticingly

52:40.740 --> 52:47.700
employable and that's from searching to shovel spots on the sinking ship of signature your

52:47.700 --> 52:56.340
uh signature is extremely accurate you are you are moving from deck chair to jet chair on a

52:56.340 --> 53:03.300
sinking ship and all of the deck chairs are on fire even the band has quit and they've escaped

53:03.300 --> 53:08.980
the sinking ship yeah the the band is making apps now they're like this is stupid now look

53:08.980 --> 53:17.220
you press here it sounds like a violin oh here's a million dollars uh but you love books and they

53:17.220 --> 53:25.300
and you know you you can't do you can't change what you love sadly um the only problem is that

53:25.300 --> 53:29.860
you have it exactly right it is essentially just start in the mail room that's what it was 20 years

53:29.860 --> 53:34.900
ago when i started i did i consulted some friends of mine who are still in the book industry who are

53:34.900 --> 53:39.460
in a position to hire people and first of all they're not interested in what authors you know

53:39.460 --> 53:44.660
and they don't want to hire you and second uh they're like yeah we we have an internship program

53:44.660 --> 53:48.340
this was at my old literary agency writer's house which is a great place you know we have

53:48.340 --> 53:52.340
an internship program here we hire from our internship pool that's how you learn it's an

53:52.340 --> 53:59.220
apprenticeship system usually young people come in will tolerate very small salaries in order to

53:59.220 --> 54:04.100
be around things that they love and then they learn the business from within there are publishing

54:04.100 --> 54:09.300
courses you can take the the columbia columbia has a publishing course which i think is a non-degree

54:09.300 --> 54:16.180
course um and then nyu has a master's degree in publishing but and certainly that will put you

54:16.180 --> 54:20.420
into the city where book publishing happens and put you in contact with people who are doing it

54:20.420 --> 54:27.220
but ultimately it is a network and apprenticeship arranged business just like hollywood just like

54:27.220 --> 54:33.060
podcast and um and i think the the warning that you have to take is that you are going to have to

54:33.060 --> 54:40.740
start over your seven years in book selling um will aid you but will not allow you to make any kind of

54:40.740 --> 54:46.020
lateral move you're going to have to start low they can read i assume so they have that skill

54:46.020 --> 54:51.140
yeah for sure for sure i mean i think being a bookseller is an i don't know what's what's more

54:51.140 --> 54:56.020
interesting if i were you and if you love books and you love making books i would go work for an

54:56.020 --> 55:03.300
agency because agencies control the thing or not control but have influence over and can nurture

55:03.300 --> 55:09.940
that which has value in a in a world of changing media which is creative people are they the bad

55:09.940 --> 55:14.660
boys of like the publishing industry you mean like are we the sha na na the publishing industry yes

55:15.220 --> 55:22.260
totally i became aware of bowser from sha na na because of his appearance on a late night

55:22.260 --> 55:29.860
uh like time life compilation program and it was so sad because it was some some woman of

55:29.860 --> 55:36.420
of indeterminate fame and this guy bowser from sha na na who's basically like selling you his

55:36.420 --> 55:42.260
culture this is the last he was sort of boxing it all up for you and asking you to make an offer

55:42.260 --> 55:52.660
before he unhinges his jaw and swallows you whole i don't know how much sha na na is is going to

55:52.660 --> 56:00.180
track with the humans who listen to your program but what i would encourage them not to do is look

56:01.060 --> 56:09.860
too deeply into the sha na na bis because they're it's not these guys were you know this is this

56:09.860 --> 56:17.540
this is this uh this 50s nostalgia group that formed in 1968 eight years

56:20.020 --> 56:26.340
eight years after the thing they formed a nostalgia group but it only oh here we go

56:26.340 --> 56:34.340
the only the only reason the only reason it worked is nostalgia was that there had been

56:34.340 --> 56:40.500
this profound cultural change in in music and culture and so it truly was as though

56:40.500 --> 56:46.820
the 50s had been you know time warped out of existence 5000 years and they represented a

56:46.820 --> 56:51.700
completely different culture these guys up at columbia university started singing these duop

56:51.700 --> 56:57.940
songs from 15 years before or 10 years before and suddenly they're this oldies act and then

56:57.940 --> 57:03.220
they go to woodstock and then they get a tv show out of it they're all really talented

57:03.220 --> 57:09.780
dudes but none of them have they have that that completely it like weird rock and roll

57:09.780 --> 57:14.820
pedigree which is that they're all white guys from massachusetts there's no rmb behind them

57:14.820 --> 57:20.340
at all they're dancing and singing in gold lamay and their show is somewhere between

57:20.340 --> 57:27.700
you know uh the malt shop and studio 54 there's so much bared chest hair one of the cool guys

57:27.700 --> 57:34.180
is like 37 years old and bald it is insane this is like a warm this is like a warm blanket this

57:34.180 --> 57:39.380
description that you're just draping over me on a camping trip the question they're just so many i

57:39.380 --> 57:45.140
know i know now did you you shaved right okay then i'll tell you the story of shanana the questions

57:45.140 --> 57:51.140
that these they're talented and terrible at the same time they're dancing it is the laziest

57:51.140 --> 57:56.180
choreography that i've ever seen big lenny who plays the saxophone who's from my home commonwealth

57:56.180 --> 58:01.700
of massachusetts and is still still alive and still out there blowing sax this guy this guy's

58:01.700 --> 58:06.660
got a beautiful tenor voice but should not be on tv not because he doesn't have a good look but

58:06.660 --> 58:12.340
he has no presence whatsoever on tv he's constantly flapping his arms around while he sings like some

58:12.340 --> 58:20.820
obese bird it's insane like everything about it and and then they all quit they all quit and became

58:20.820 --> 58:27.540
uh doctors and attorneys and professors one of them is a linguistics professor at hofstra university

58:28.180 --> 58:33.780
and uh and they're all they're all professionals now those who who are still with us uh except

58:33.780 --> 58:40.020
for bowser who's still out there selling the greece right and then and then jaco donnie and

58:40.020 --> 58:47.780
screamin scott the nice thing about his starting in 68 with the 50s uh uh culture for bowser is

58:47.780 --> 58:53.220
that now if you are not aware of their history he just looks like somebody who's aged really really

58:53.220 --> 58:58.020
well how is this guy still hanging with this this lifestyle because it was close enough

58:58.020 --> 59:02.580
to the 50s it just seems like a really really old guy who looks fantastic

59:04.900 --> 59:10.100
appending the word by the way oh i know yeah this is what this is well i've been thinking

59:10.100 --> 59:15.940
about all night long you guys everyone you know what you can all go down this hole together

59:15.940 --> 59:20.020
let's go into the next catching up on this john and you are very right about this gentleman i

59:20.020 --> 59:25.860
got distracted from the conversation and i just wanted to say that uh bowser from shana is a

59:25.860 --> 59:29.860
co-founder of a group called senior votes count which is a political action committee for old

59:29.860 --> 59:34.740
people you guys i think the rest of this podcast should just be the the sound of us all just

59:34.740 --> 59:40.660
quietly clicking the internet and then just speaking up when you find an interesting

59:40.660 --> 59:46.020
challenge my third of the program usually is uh here's a question for everybody what dishes

59:46.020 --> 59:50.180
would all three of you cook on a cooking competition there's somebody not great with

59:50.180 --> 59:55.380
math there four of us now but anyway what dishes would you cook on a cooking competition i'm gonna

59:55.380 --> 01:00:01.300
be quiet for a minute i'm just gonna say scrambled eggs the end go oh that was not gonna be mine was

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.420
gonna be you know what i do well that that's what makes it a competition from the frugal gourmet i

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:13.620
learned this recipe to make an omelet that has uh uh apples cooked in brandy and then you put those

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:19.220
in the omelet that's really good i think i'd probably make that justin you and i need just

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.060
you're bringing up the frugal gourmet means you and i need to go sit on a porch somewhere for a

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.420
couple of hours and you know about his sad history well i'm gonna say had the the sadness that he

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:36.820
brought yeah it was a founder of sha na na and then they forced him out get out of here if you

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.620
had told me that the frugal gourmet or as my uncle jim used to call him frug

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:49.860
had been had had a segment on sha na na in its fourth year of syndication in 1981

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:55.060
i would be so i would believe it so hard and i would hate you for the rest of my life when

01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:00.340
i learned it wasn't true we're making a lot of money on sha na na and we want to spend it on

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:06.740
shit i don't know not so fast but justin seriously let's not let's not go down a frugal let's let

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:14.900
these guys answer uh probably some sort of pie oh really i i know it's it's it's not a great

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:20.500
tactic like a dessert like a dessert pie or a chicken pot pie uh no a dessert pie not a not a

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:26.980
quiche um you make a dessert pie probably something with pecans or blueberries inside of it yeah it's

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:32.420
like the only thing i can do that i feel confident about do you do you do you bake with uh with

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.300
shortening or butter or what no i typically store by the the crust which i know is blasphemous but

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.820
by which i you know this is what i'm saying do you know what you get for that at the at the state

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:48.340
fair a black ribbon and that means you're going to be killed within 24 hours and then the crops

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:55.780
will grow again uh i make things incessantly absurd drawing machines books musical instruments

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.100
and furniture to name a few i'm good at the solitary business of realizing these works but

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:05.060
my trouble is with the social effort required to sustain my ability to make them i understand

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.380
that people are most concerned with their own lives and so talking casually about my projects

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.260
or worse promoting them makes me feel manipulative or conceited how do you make people aware of what

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.940
you're doing without making yourself feel obnoxious so that's from bashful in brooklyn

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:24.180
what i mean that's what promoters are for right that's who's the higher man yeah who's bashful

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:29.940
in brooklyn first of all you're i i think that here are the things though that i would even though

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:35.700
this person is a liar and a fraud i can still address some advice to those of you who are out

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.500
there who are making uh choices of what to do with their lives creatively and there is discomfort

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:45.220
that comes and anxiety that comes in being a creative person first of all this this liar and

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.900
fraud is correct that most people are concerned with their own lives no one cares about what

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.900
you're making and that's the way it should be you make something that draws someone attention that

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.980
will happen naturally you have an opportunity to put it out there you do have to put it out there

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.580
you don't have to believe me you don't have to be going on twitter saying check out my stuff check

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.300
out my stuff check out my stuff if it's the work is giving you pleasure then it should give you

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:10.260
enough pleasure to to put it up for sale or take a picture of it and put it on tumblr or try to

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.340
get it published or whatever you don't have to be an incessant self-promoter you don't have to

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.860
sabotage yourself either and then i find you know i find helps with that what have a wife or a friend

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:25.780
with you that will do it for you and then you can act embarrassed and bad like well i yeah i do do

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:36.980
this thing because that's what friends are for for promoting your shit for you it's a collaborative

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.900
thing that's why i made such good friends the flavor flavor all those years ago yeah you need

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:47.060
a hype man exactly what the what the fuck have you done for flavor flavor lately no flavor flavor

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:52.260
is helping his brand wait does flavor flavor have his own hype man is it like an unending chain of

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:57.700
hype he has an entire hype man yes i think you put your finger on it exactly that's what the

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:04.500
internet is it ends with me um because i'm i just can't i just can't get anybody going

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:13.300
i got one more question in the tv's the cosby show uh which huxval child is the best in terms

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:19.620
of plot lines memorable sayings and overall attitude that's from bill leaver in baton rouge

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:29.380
really touching on your your your key practices your your strengths in the cosby verse well i i

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:36.100
actually been catching up on a lot of the cosby show on uh on the video on demand function of

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:41.220
my cable box because they're funny you know what guys those were shows were well written

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:50.740
well written funny charming shows that my children love they find it incredibly accessible and they

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:56.740
don't they don't they don't know anything about pattern matching from the 80s sure they don't

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:02.820
know and now this internet stranger is trying to turn it into a cosby child blood sport

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:06.980
right where they they fight for dominance that is not how mr cosby ran the set sir

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:11.380
everyone there was held to high expectations but they were a family

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:17.860
just ask malcolm jamal warner who will not stop talking about it that guy but one of the things

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:26.260
when i was a kid i loved peter the caucasian obese neighbor because that was my entry point

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:33.140
to the show it was your way in and i obviously i i was in love with and part of me still is

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:39.540
in love with lisa bonet sandra sure thank you so sandra is actually my favorite because uh she is

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:45.220
the she is the schrodinger's huxtable in that i i don't know if you guys know this in the pilot

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:51.940
episode of the show they do not acknowledge or accept her existence right as an extant human

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:58.820
being they say i think uh what either claire or cliff says don't be coy you know exactly who says

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:04.900
it uh claire says uh something along the lines of she says something along the lines of having four

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:12.980
children right addressing i'm i'm assuming denise and theo and rudy and vanessa while not acknowledging

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:18.260
sandra's existence so she doesn't come in until halfway through season one and then she's only

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:23.380
in like a few episodes well not a few are you suggesting that she's uh that she's a hallucination

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:30.740
i'm assuming that she exists in in in both quantum states at the same time at that moment she she

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.900
did not exist or maybe that was just like a really harsh i'm gonna look up the quote because maybe

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:40.420
they were just burning rudy can we address that this exact strategy was applied to miss judy

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:47.860
winslow after the fifth season of family matters anybody they judy winslow the the young daughter

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:55.620
disappeared like it is it is beyond creepy there are this season their daughter was erased never

01:06:55.620 --> 01:07:00.580
to be mentioned again from the from the stream from the time stream uh okay what about what about

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:05.700
richie's older brother on happy days i think what we're saying everyone's siblings on every episode

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:11.140
of boy meets world where suddenly someone will have a sister for the purpose of an episode so

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:17.460
someone is disappearing and reappearing the siblings of culture everyone there's a there's

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:23.700
no one should be more concerned about it than you guys a sitcom baba yaga is is luring these

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:30.500
children into the woods the exact line from the cosby show in the pilot episode which does not

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:38.180
acknowledge uh sandra uh it's sandra theistic uh claire says why do we have four children

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:43.620
cliff says because we did not want five so it is entirely possible that they are saying rudy you

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:51.860
were uh a mistake uh you bring a lot of heat to this show but um uh boy howdy we we really should

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:57.220
have stopped with an even quartet i agree i agree that sandra is the most uncanny of the of the

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:04.500
cosmos you look at her and you just think like am i looking at a person am i looking at anything

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:09.140
right now it's so hard to tell she goes it makes me really regret that i didn't come on to the show

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:17.140
as the as the previously unannounced fourth mackleroy brother sadly you're still john hodgeman

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:26.740
