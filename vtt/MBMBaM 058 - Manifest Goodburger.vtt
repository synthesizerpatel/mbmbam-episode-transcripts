WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.640
Welcome, my brother. My brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. It's June,

00:49.520 --> 00:56.560
and you know what that means. We are frantically prepping for the biggest summer event of the year,

00:56.560 --> 01:02.960
a week-long celebration of fun and frivolity that we like to call FatBeachCon 2011.

01:02.960 --> 01:09.360
PBC is the industry insider lingo. Yeah, PBC.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.760
I heard that this year they were gonna actually do a panel and they were gonna get Alma Collins

01:13.760 --> 01:19.120
and Eric Fleeks and Brian Hooks and Jermaine Huggie Hopkins. They're all gonna be there, guys.

01:19.120 --> 01:25.600
Travis, do you possess an encyclopedic knowledge of the people who were in FatBeach with a Ph?

01:25.600 --> 01:30.720
Travis is actually the keynote speaker of our event. Actually, we refer to it as the

01:30.720 --> 01:37.680
the G note speaker, but you get the idea. I can't remember my girlfriend's name.

01:40.080 --> 01:46.240
You can buy the soundtrack to FatBeach on Amazon right now on audio CD for $1.99.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.440
I actually can't. I can't do that. That is prime, too. Two-day shipping. I need it now.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.520
Hey, FatBeach. Amazon, get it to me now.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.200
How quickly can you get it before our FatBeachCon? My name is Justin McElroy.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.520
I'm your oldest brother and conference scheduling supervisor.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.680
I am Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother and keynote speaker.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.480
G note speaker.

02:09.200 --> 02:14.960
I am Griffin McElroy. I am a Coolio cosplayer.

02:14.960 --> 02:22.480
So what we do is we take your questions, both FatBeach and non-FatBeach related,

02:22.480 --> 02:27.760
and turn them into wisdom. Let's get right into it. Hi, my bim bam. I'm contemplating

02:27.760 --> 02:30.880
venturing out into the Twittersphere for the first time, and I feel like I need a

02:30.880 --> 02:36.560
signature Twitter handle to mark this exciting occasion. I want to use a variation of my name,

02:36.560 --> 02:42.320
Jody Burgs Bacon, and I'm hoping you can throw out some ideas for me.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.360
The people who brought up people brought us people's nasty gum are clearly brilliant

02:47.360 --> 02:51.840
at branding. Work your magic and thanks for your help, Jody. Jody, what a great question.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.960
Jody Burgs Bacon.

02:54.960 --> 03:01.360
That is your it's your virtual identity. If you think you aren't who you are anymore,

03:01.360 --> 03:05.200
you are what you tweet. That's so deep, Griffin.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.320
That's like, all right.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.720
That being said, Burger Time.

03:08.720 --> 03:13.680
Burger Time is pretty good. I give you that. Only you spell it B-E-R-G like your name is

03:13.680 --> 03:16.560
spelled. Enjoy.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.040
How about Baconator?

03:19.040 --> 03:21.360
The Baconator. The Burgs Baconator.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.680
I didn't even consider the bacon contingent.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.160
There's a lot.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.120
God damn it.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.400
How about Jody 1-6-X-I?

03:32.640 --> 03:33.680
She's not a robot.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.800
Oh. Then I've got nothing.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.760
Then I've got nothing.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.760
What about something that plays off her name and the fact that she's going to be talking

03:41.760 --> 03:47.520
on Twitter? Something like Jodydeas. Something that's out there.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.120
What about Jodyalog?

03:55.440 --> 04:00.560
It's like Twitter isn't just about me broadcasting to you. It's about the two of us talking back.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.160
Having a convo.

04:02.160 --> 04:10.720
Yeah. I think if you can get Jodyalog, I'd go with that. What about Candace Burgs Bacon?

04:10.720 --> 04:13.040
What about Meredith Baxter Burgs Bacon?

04:13.040 --> 04:16.880
What about Good Burgs Bacon?

04:16.880 --> 04:20.000
Good Burgs Bacon. Fat Beach. Brought to you by Fat Beach.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.920
Brought to you by Fat Beach. God, that movie was Fat Beach, wasn't it?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.600
Good Burger's basically Fat Beach.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.760
But in a burger shop.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.080
Yeah.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.760
Fuck, that movie is so funny.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.600
Well, hold on. Good Burger?

04:33.600 --> 04:34.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:35.040 --> 04:35.760
It's pretty good?

04:35.760 --> 04:41.840
I wish I could find it right now because Kel has the secret recipe to his sauce that turns

04:41.840 --> 04:42.800
the whole stand around.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.160
Okay.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.560
Who was that? Neil Patrick Harris? Wanted it.

04:48.480 --> 04:56.480
Do you feel like they missed a cross-branding opportunity by not making a Good Burger stand

04:56.480 --> 05:01.600
at Fat Beach? Like, how did you guys get so fat, obviously? Obviously crossover.

05:02.320 --> 05:08.000
Would you guys eat at a real Good Burger? If that was a real thing. I think that,

05:08.960 --> 05:11.680
as long as we're speaking about Good Burger branding opportunities, because that is what

05:11.680 --> 05:12.800
Jody asked about.

05:12.800 --> 05:12.960
Yeah.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.440
I don't know. Like, I think that that's a successful business. I would love for people

05:19.440 --> 05:24.000
to just open up an ironic Good Burger stand and it turns into a chain and it becomes like

05:24.000 --> 05:27.360
it beats Subway and is now the most famous fast food restaurant in the world.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.280
Griffin, can you break down for me real quick what an ironic Good Burger stand is?

05:32.000 --> 05:36.560
Well, people are like, I'm talking right now, like, hey, you guys remember Good Burger?

05:36.560 --> 05:38.720
That was a solid pick.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.280
I think that if you name your-

05:39.280 --> 05:42.800
Do you think anyone other than us is having that conversation ever?

05:42.800 --> 05:48.080
I think if you name your stand Good Burger, but say it's ironic, then that's bad. Like,

05:48.080 --> 05:50.000
bad burgers is what you're selling.

05:50.000 --> 05:50.720
Oh.

05:50.720 --> 05:56.400
Yeah. I sell good burgers. Get it? This tastes bad.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.440
Why did you do this?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.000
I just don't know why you're trying to take the wind out of my sails.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.040
You're right. I'm sorry. To me, whether or not I would frequent, patronize, I would haunt

06:07.040 --> 06:12.160
a local real world earth, you know, 619-

06:12.160 --> 06:18.640
A tangible, not a Good Burger of the ethereal realm. I'm talking about a real ass tangible

06:18.640 --> 06:19.360
Good Burger.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.520
Manifest corporeal Good Burger.

06:25.280 --> 06:30.240
My frequency of dining there would depend on how many adjectives are on the outside in

06:30.240 --> 06:34.000
the advertising, because I'm a sucker for those. Like, I could say to you right now

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
that no, that probably wouldn't be a good idea, especially if I see Kellen there up

06:38.000 --> 06:39.840
to his old tricks, up to his new jinx.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.680
He wouldn't turn up the pot.

06:41.680 --> 06:46.160
If they have a sign outside that says, like, beefy or satisfying, like, I don't know.

06:46.160 --> 06:46.480
Juicy.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.680
Maybe. Juicy. Like, exactly.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.000
But if I walk in, and I see Kell, and he's in the milkshake machine, like, spinning

06:54.000 --> 06:57.680
around, I will leave that restaurant right away. That is not sanitary Kell.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.880
Well, that's a health violation.

06:58.880 --> 07:03.680
I'm gonna say that I think I would actually be more likely to go to an ethereal Good

07:03.680 --> 07:06.720
Burger. Like, a Good Burger of the mind.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.360
Well, as soon as you die, you'll be able to do just that.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.640
God, I hope so.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.880
Hey, Griffin, you got a Yahoo for us?

07:12.880 --> 07:18.720
I do. Here's one. This one was sent in by Crystal Whalen. Thank you, Crystal Whalen.

07:18.720 --> 07:28.240
Regular contributor, Crystal Whalen. It's by Yahoo Answers user Olaf Simprini, who asks,

07:29.120 --> 07:31.520
looking for a career in genital painting?

07:32.160 --> 07:32.960
In what?

07:33.760 --> 07:36.880
I assume he's asking for himself, but the way you made it sound sounds like the start

07:36.880 --> 07:39.920
of an infomercial. Like, looking for a career in genital painting?

07:39.920 --> 07:45.200
Excuse me, I'm sorry, one more time. Genital painting?

07:46.080 --> 07:48.800
Uh, yes. Genital painting.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.160
I'm gonna need some more info.

07:50.160 --> 07:55.600
Well, he provides it, if you'd give me a chance. The other day, I was with my boyfriend, and

07:55.600 --> 08:02.480
he asked me to paint the Hand of God painting by Michelangelo on his penis. It says wang,

08:02.480 --> 08:06.240
but we're all adults here. I think being in his clinical terms.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
Bracket penis in bracket.

08:08.240 --> 08:13.600
It looks really, really good, and I'm wondering if there's a sort of industry for this thing,

08:13.600 --> 08:19.440
because I think it is my calling. Please help. Do you know of any universities or colleges that

08:19.440 --> 08:23.440
specialize in this sort of thing? Also, I have pictures, if anyone is interested in my work.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.360
Check, please. Yeah, hello. I would like to get on that.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.080
Yeah, can you, uh, my bim bam dot com?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.440
Yeah, just send that out.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.360
Just send that to our web address, I guess?

08:33.360 --> 08:35.920
Send that to Day Express, because I need that.

08:35.920 --> 08:41.920
If you could overnight, I'll front the shipping, COD. Just gotta see them.

08:41.920 --> 08:45.200
I want to say that when you first posed the question,

08:46.800 --> 08:50.320
I immediately interpreted it as painting with one's genitals.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.400
There's three ways I could see doing this, right? Painting with your genitals,

08:55.920 --> 09:01.360
painting on someone's genitals, which is using genitals as a medium for art,

09:01.360 --> 09:10.960
and then there is the actual painting of genitals. Like, check out this sweet pee pee that I painted

09:10.960 --> 09:12.640
here with my watercolors.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.960
Oh wow, yeah. I didn't even think about that.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.640
I can make a pee pee sing with watercolors.

09:18.640 --> 09:22.720
I went to the zoo once and they trained an elephant to paint on this guy's genitals.

09:22.720 --> 09:26.000
It was pretty cool. Horrifying for him.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.400
I don't think that's a- I don't think-

09:28.400 --> 09:32.240
I'm almost positive that was- wait, was that on TV again?

09:32.240 --> 09:34.400
No, that was a movie. Yeah, that was a movie, yes.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.840
The Operation Demba Drop.

09:35.840 --> 09:36.880
Yes! God, I was-

09:36.880 --> 09:38.240
That was the best movie.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.080
I did not watch it that closely, but I'm pretty sure that that's what happened.

09:44.080 --> 09:49.120
There's a really great scene where it's tender and the elephant gets a paintbrush.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.040
I would think! I mean, that elephant's huge.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.000
It's very tender, and the elephant, he is not confident in his painting,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.800
but Chuck Sheen talks him through his psychoses,

10:00.800 --> 10:04.240
and then the elephant paints on Chuck Sheen's balls and dick.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.800
You know, people give him a lot of static for being nutso,

10:08.800 --> 10:12.160
but you go through something like that, you weren't there.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.440
You don't know what that film-

10:13.440 --> 10:16.480
He's operating on a whole nother plane than everyone else,

10:16.480 --> 10:19.360
and it's because he has had this amazing experience.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.840
Also, on this plane, Ethereal Goodburger.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.600
It's just Chuck Sheen and Ethereal Goodburger.

10:25.600 --> 10:30.080
I would like to point out to the person who asked this question that if you look at,

10:30.080 --> 10:33.120
okay, so you're painting a Hanagon painting on your boyfriend's dick,

10:33.120 --> 10:37.760
is it possible that maybe that skill could translate to a more conventional medium or-

10:37.760 --> 10:39.920
No, no, no, absolutely not.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.120
No, only dicks.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.160
Dicks?

10:42.160 --> 10:46.240
I'll tell you what, it's the dimensions of it.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.360
The contour?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.440
It's like a natural easel.

10:49.440 --> 10:56.640
Natural easel, and it's taut and canvassy.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.400
I get it.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.600
I get what this guy's selling.

11:00.880 --> 11:05.920
I think that it is the most perfect sort of medium that we can wear.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.520
It's the most natural, at least.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.040
A lot of the canvases these days are corporate-made,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.840
and this is shade-grown artistic medium.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.080
What if you painted a dick on someone's dick?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.280
Whoa.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.400
What if you painted a dick on someone's vagina?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.760
See, that's why I'm upset by this question,

11:25.760 --> 11:28.320
because it doesn't leave many options for our lady friends, because I don't-

11:28.880 --> 11:31.440
You could paint a Georgia O'Keeffe painting on someone's vagina.

11:32.080 --> 11:32.560
Sure.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.060
Yeah.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.200
So are there any responses?

11:37.840 --> 11:40.240
Anybody have some good ideas?

11:40.240 --> 11:43.200
Somebody said, ooh, I want the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.640
Very clever.

11:44.640 --> 11:49.120
For my crooked dick.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.640
For my tilted member.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.400
And for my sweetie, maybe the Grand Canyon.

11:54.400 --> 11:54.880
Hey, dog.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.160
Hey, dog.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.080
That's not quite right.

12:00.640 --> 12:06.080
Yeah, don't let her hear you talking that way, because that ain't gonna go over well.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
I have a nickname for your vagina, honey.

12:09.440 --> 12:09.940
Honey.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.200
Hey, honey.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.240
You're gonna love it.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.560
Listen to this great goof, honey.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.200
Hey, check it.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.320
The Mariana Trench.

12:17.360 --> 12:17.920
Get it?

12:17.920 --> 12:18.480
I love you.

12:19.440 --> 12:24.480
So we got another club banger, another hot question coming in from a real person,

12:24.480 --> 12:29.920
and not like the one Griffin read from a monster, an animal, a subhuman.

12:29.920 --> 12:36.560
How long do you have to wait after you break up with a girl to start dating one of her friends?

12:36.560 --> 12:40.880
I had a friends with benefits relationship with a young lady that sort of turned into

12:40.880 --> 12:44.960
an exclusive relationship of a sort, but it's become clear that one of her friends

12:44.960 --> 12:46.480
is interested in dating me.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.680
How long do I have to wait to pursue this other young lady?

12:49.680 --> 12:50.640
Oh my god.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.080
Is this anonymous?

12:53.040 --> 12:53.540
Yeah.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.800
Okay, first of all, it sounds like you're still dating the other lady.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.040
So obviously not soon.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.360
Yeah, not this second.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.600
It hasn't been long enough, because it's been none.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.560
It's been no time.

13:10.560 --> 13:17.360
What's that rule or something like the amount of time you're with someone divided in half

13:17.360 --> 13:19.840
is the amount of time you more in the relationship or something.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.120
Isn't there like an accepted standard for that?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.520
It is.

13:26.400 --> 13:32.800
Yeah, it's how long you've been together divided by half, and then you add the number

13:32.800 --> 13:35.840
of lunar cycles that happened while you were dating.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.880
And your first pet's name and the street you grew up on.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.520
And then you multiply it by infinity.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.720
Sheila, I miss you.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.640
Oh, Sheila.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.160
I wish I dated a lady named Sheila.

13:50.160 --> 13:50.800
I know.

13:50.800 --> 13:58.560
I say if there's a special somebody in your field of vision that you suspect it has a

13:59.600 --> 14:03.680
little, you know, that you don't wait on it at all.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.320
You break up with friends with benefits.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.760
And then say goodbye to her forever.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
How's this for a benefit?

14:11.760 --> 14:12.000
Bye.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.720
Here's your severance package.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.360
Enjoy.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.960
I got nothing for you.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.720
Shouldn't have nailed me down when you had the chance.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.800
This is why it never works.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.120
This is why this never works, because right now I'm doing this.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.720
So this is a pretty good example of why friends with benefits is not a thing.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.960
And then you just go talk to another girl.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.240
What's the matter?

14:30.880 --> 14:31.600
Or a guy?

14:31.600 --> 14:32.560
Is it a guy or a girl?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.960
Listen, only guys would do this.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.320
I didn't even have to ask, of course.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.360
Girls don't think this way.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.440
Only guys would be this monstrous.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.920
You got to dance with the one that brought you.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.040
And that means you have to stay with this girl that you don't really care for for the

14:47.040 --> 14:49.760
rest of your life, because leaving her, that would be rude, sir.

14:50.880 --> 14:51.920
You don't want to be that guy, do you?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.600
Do you want to be rude, sir?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.080
Would you rather be civil?

14:58.800 --> 15:00.480
God, I miss the Victorian era.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.040
I know.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.400
You couldn't get away with that shit.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.320
You didn't have to worry about dating.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.520
You said, hey, daddy, hey, mommy, who am I marrying?

15:07.520 --> 15:08.800
Tell me who to love, please.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.720
You're marrying Carla, the butchers.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.280
She is the eldest of three daughters that didn't die of tuberculosis.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.120
She's got a fine frame.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.800
You're really going to be into it.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.280
Hey, I like this girl, but I'm afraid to ask her out because we haven't spent a lot of

15:23.280 --> 15:23.840
time together.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.640
However, I'm sure if I wait too long, the whole thing might peter out.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.720
What should I do, form spring?

15:30.720 --> 15:34.800
Does he know a guy named Peter that's going to sweep his lady?

15:34.800 --> 15:35.440
I don't know.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.640
So 58 episodes in, and that's the final answer.

15:42.640 --> 15:48.640
This is where I finally admit that I don't get these people that, like, sometimes we

15:48.640 --> 15:53.120
get these questions and the answer is so obvious that I think they're fucking with me.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.240
Like, hey, hey, just ask her, dummy.

15:58.240 --> 16:04.560
If you don't ask her to spend time with you, you can't spend time.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.760
How do you think that happens?

16:05.760 --> 16:10.720
You're not filling up, like, a giant novelty thermometer on a donation board.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.640
You don't have to spend X amount of time before you ask her out.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.520
You're just, like, hoping you get stuck in an elevator.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.280
Just ask her to go fucking go.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.800
You want to go ice fishing with me?

16:22.800 --> 16:26.880
Hey, I hear there's going to be a tornado warning on Thursday.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.320
Do you want to come to my basement?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.600
And, like, it'll be hilarious.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.120
Do you want to get accidentally stuck in a freezer with me so we can recap all the great

16:33.120 --> 16:34.400
times we've had together?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.640
Like, in that one episode of Perfect Strangers?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.240
Because then I can ask you out after that.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.120
Cute meets, they don't happen in real life.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.320
No, they don't.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.840
They do not happen like that.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.600
Do you know how you spend more time with someone?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.640
You ask them out.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.560
Yeah, just ask them out.

16:49.120 --> 16:49.760
You're ready.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.680
Peter, which I'm assuming is your name, and that you've come up with-

16:53.680 --> 16:54.560
Oh god, I hope so.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.680
And he uses the phrase Peter out to mean something awesome.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.360
Yeah, you guys want Peter out?

16:59.360 --> 17:01.520
That's what he says whenever he leaves the room.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.560
Peter out?

17:02.560 --> 17:04.000
I, uh-

17:04.000 --> 17:04.720
Hey, check this out.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.760
Check this out, Peter.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.360
You wait too long, and you die.

17:08.400 --> 17:08.900
Oops.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.440
Ah, I could have loved her forever.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.800
No, I can't.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.240
You got any big plans this weekend?

17:14.240 --> 17:14.720
Yeah, man.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.040
I'm going to go to Zaxby's and totally Peter out.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.520
Yeah, I'm going to go to Zaxby's and totally Peter out.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.720
Those people aren't going to know what they saw.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.480
It's going to be heinous in there.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.440
I'm just going to let loose and Peter out.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.400
I'm just going to Peter out.

17:28.400 --> 17:28.960
I've earned it.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.800
I've earned one fucking weekend of petering out, I think.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.720
I've sold all the shoes at Foot Locker.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.960
I think I'm going to have one weekend of petering out.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.060
I think.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.400
I think I've earned that.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.560
They can't take that from me.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.520
Hey, hey, hey, you can take as much alimony from me as you want.

17:47.520 --> 17:52.160
You'll never like my my ability to Peter out was not part of the settlement.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.260
Depra.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.960
How about a Yahoo?

17:56.960 --> 17:57.760
Yeah, I'm ready.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.000
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.640
Thank you, Jacob.

18:01.280 --> 18:01.600
Champion.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jenna Rain who asks.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.840
Sexy sailor suit in bed.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.040
Dirty things to say.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.240
It is my BF's dream for me to wear my sexy sailor suit for him.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.400
What are some dirty things to say in bed?

18:16.400 --> 18:18.240
And before to get him in the mood.

18:19.600 --> 18:24.160
I'm going to demand that all of the things that we say

18:24.160 --> 18:26.800
for the next few minutes be nautically themed.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.340
Okay.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.880
So she wants to turn it.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.080
She wants to to raise his mast.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.880
I don't have time to load the torpedoes.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.380
Yeah.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.880
In a seaman's garb.

18:41.440 --> 18:41.920
Okay.

18:41.920 --> 18:42.480
Wants to.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.640
To vagina off the starboard bow.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.040
Plunge into my briny deep.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.800
That's good boners.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.040
That's good Travis.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.240
It's very on the nose.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.280
He can get a tattoo on his penis.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.000
It says welcome aboard like Kelsey Grammer in the hit film.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.800
Don't Paris Co.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.440
That would be good.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.480
I hope you're ready.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.400
Time to swap the poop deck.

19:10.400 --> 19:10.960
Oh no.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.600
Oh, I'm ready for cock Cousteau.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.680
Um, I just don't.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.280
Unfortunately, you're not my first mate.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.800
Come break a bottle of champagne on my face.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.880
I don't like that at all.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.400
Are not a play got naughty.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.680
It's not a play a thing.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.840
Like it's it's nautically themed.

19:39.840 --> 19:44.640
Justin can I tell you as somebody who on a weekly basis scours Yahoo answers for things

19:44.640 --> 19:45.120
that are funny.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.840
There is every kind of play that you can imagine.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.600
There's just no kind of play that I've been.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.360
I've been trying to find a way to talk about it on the show.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.720
You guys know about age play.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.480
Excuse me.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.080
It's called age play.

19:58.960 --> 20:02.960
I couldn't find a funny Yahoo answer about it because they're all just so just so crushing.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.280
But it's where one person uh, pretends to be a baby.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.840
Oh, look at him.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.760
But not like you pretend to be like a senior citizen and get a nursing home.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.320
You can.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.400
You can do that.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.560
The world is your oyster in the world of age play.

20:19.120 --> 20:19.600
Fuck.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.680
You just got into the movies for 550.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.400
That's so hot.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.200
Tell me about that early bird special.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.040
We're eating dinner at 4 p.m.

20:27.040 --> 20:27.840
God, I'm a wreck.

20:28.480 --> 20:32.880
Do you think that there are people that are like hardcore like goth enthusiasts or steam

20:32.880 --> 20:37.520
punks or something and their idea of this kind of sex play is like you put on a suit

20:37.520 --> 20:41.040
and you carry a briefcase and like you talk about spreadsheets.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.640
They call it they call it norming it up.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.020
Norm.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.720
Um, norm play.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.600
I can't wait to norm you tonight.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.040
Tonight.

20:49.040 --> 20:49.520
Let's just listen.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.720
We're having casserole.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.040
I want to plan the perfect evening.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.960
First, I want to I want to light some candles.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.240
We bought it back from Body Works.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.480
And then I want to

21:00.480 --> 21:01.600
What's that on the TV?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.360
Oh, my God, it's a Becker marathon.

21:05.520 --> 21:10.480
I want to put on that Mad Men soundtrack we bought at Target and just go crazy.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.320
Well, go restrained on you.

21:12.320 --> 21:16.400
And when that's done, I got Colby Callie lined up.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.680
It's next on iTunes.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.080
I'll open your delicate mouth and feed you some Oreos.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.240
You imagine goth people can't eat Oreos.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.560
Got people can't eat Oreos.

21:28.560 --> 21:33.440
I know they like blood cookies.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.160
That's true.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.680
From Toll House.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.720
Those are delicious.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.440
Those Keibler elf commercials are fucked up, though.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.400
Give me regard.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.120
Come into the tree.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.440
And I'll survive it.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.080
Put a baby in.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.160
Elk and blood cookies.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.640
Introduce that blood cookies.

21:54.640 --> 21:55.200
Don't ask.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.480
Hey, I'm headed to uni this coming fall.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.600
Do you mean college?

21:59.600 --> 22:00.480
Do you mean college?

22:00.480 --> 22:01.280
College.

22:01.280 --> 22:06.560
This is an American show this coming fall and will likely be rooming with a bunch of guys

22:06.560 --> 22:07.840
I have never met before.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.280
I actually call it call.

22:10.080 --> 22:10.880
I shorted it to that.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.380
Callie.

22:12.160 --> 22:12.660
Okay.

22:14.240 --> 22:21.760
My issue is that I am a huge anime fan and will likely want to have anime paraphernalia

22:21.760 --> 22:22.720
in my living room.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.520
I want to have anime paraphernalia in my living space.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.040
I want to, of course, make a good impression and not weird out the people I will be rooming

22:31.040 --> 22:32.560
with for the following school year.

22:33.200 --> 22:40.240
So my question for you is how much anime stuff is too much anime stuff?

22:40.240 --> 22:41.680
That's tactless and Toronto.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.320
The answer to that last question is one.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.920
I'm going to say go out on a limb and say if you have to ask that question, you have

22:49.920 --> 22:51.440
too much anime stuff.

22:51.440 --> 22:51.760
Yeah.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.000
It is a concern that you have.

22:55.280 --> 22:55.760
You have a-

22:55.760 --> 22:56.560
Overdone it.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.960
You have a troubling amount of anime stuff.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.200
You're you're looking in your bedroom right now and you are worrying about how you're

23:03.200 --> 23:08.400
going to fit all your anime stuff into a space with a bunch of a gentleman you don't know.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.880
For real though, I think we can answer this honestly without being mean.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.640
I think there's a tasteful way to do it.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.680
Let me give you an example.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.760
I like video games.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.160
Yeah.

23:20.160 --> 23:28.320
My jam. When I was in high school and middle school or high school, on my wall, I cut out

23:28.880 --> 23:34.000
pictures from video game magazines and tape them all over the wall, right?

23:34.000 --> 23:38.480
Like I taped video game pictures all over the wall because I like video games, right?

23:38.480 --> 23:47.760
I still like video games, but what I have now is a poster, a very tasteful poster for

23:47.760 --> 23:52.000
one game that I enjoy that was made by our good friend Justin Russo.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.200
And that's sort of the nod to video games I have.

23:55.200 --> 24:00.640
And it's like it still makes sense in the space.

24:00.640 --> 24:06.880
It's sort of like it's tasteful, but I'm not like relinquishing my love of this thing.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.920
What you shouldn't do is be ashamed of this thing that you like.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.320
Yeah.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.440
We'll give you shit for it.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.240
It's not that.

24:12.240 --> 24:16.800
It's that this is a time to transition a lot of things in your life.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.320
You know, going to college, it's a big step towards adulthood and maybe you look around

24:20.320 --> 24:24.720
and say, you know, maybe it's time to kind of revamp my approach to these things that

24:24.720 --> 24:25.520
I love.

24:25.520 --> 24:30.160
Maybe it's time to, you know, start getting some, you know, books on anime and stuff like

24:30.160 --> 24:31.680
that instead of cool.

24:31.680 --> 24:31.920
Yeah.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.280
That's a very sort of cut out of magazines.

24:35.280 --> 24:35.520
Yeah.

24:35.520 --> 24:42.000
And you know, the other sort of worry and the reason that we I think the reason like

24:42.000 --> 24:45.600
it's very easy to sort of make gags about anime, but we all all three of us like some

24:45.600 --> 24:46.960
really terrible shit.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.640
I seem to remember one episode where we spent the first 10 minutes talking about Good Burger.

24:53.200 --> 24:57.120
That was the hardest choice I had to make of what to do with all my Good Burger paraphernalia.

24:57.120 --> 25:03.280
You're going into a time where you're in high school, you're graduating high school,

25:03.280 --> 25:08.960
you're going into college, you really will sort of be defined in large part by the next

25:08.960 --> 25:09.440
four years.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.520
And I think you want to go into it without stigma, you know, like I think you want to

25:13.520 --> 25:18.400
go into it kind of as close to a blank slate as you can and open yourself up to a lot of

25:18.400 --> 25:20.400
stuff that you're going to be exposed to for the first time.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.520
You know, maybe you get there and you do the blank slate and you go, you know, I could

25:23.520 --> 25:30.400
probably do a little like corner of, you know, figurines here or a poster here.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.120
And you kind of build back up to a point that you're comfortable with.

25:33.920 --> 25:38.080
But I think it's best to start at zero and then find where the new normal is for you.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.880
Don't define yourself by anime, I guess is what what I'm saying.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.160
No, Christ, no, nobody should do that or any other.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.920
You shouldn't define yourself by anything.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.600
No, no pop culture thing.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.520
You're not allowed to define yourself with that.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.480
Like video games.

25:52.080 --> 25:55.360
I don't I really don't like it when people are like super into movies.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.320
There's like, oh, check out my Criterion collection.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.280
It's like, cool.

25:59.280 --> 25:59.920
I got Netflix.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.800
Or you're like the music snob or the movie.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.480
Yeah, just figure out who tactless in Toronto is.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.800
And maybe he's not tactless.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.520
That's what you'll discover.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.320
That's what I hope you'll discover.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.320
Maybe he's a smooth operator.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.720
Maybe he's a smooth operator with a pension for Cowboy Bebop.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.520
Hey, and remember, you're going in.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.120
You're going in and nobody knows you.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.800
Like you're a complete enigma.

26:22.800 --> 26:27.840
If you if you lay out all your anime cards on the table, like right from the jump,

26:27.840 --> 26:30.400
people will think they they've cracked your case.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.320
Yeah, you got to go in sneakier than that.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.800
You got to go in and put a put a picture of like a football guy.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.280
Nobody else see that coming.

26:39.280 --> 26:43.520
What if you went in there with you?

26:43.520 --> 26:44.880
You went in there with nothing.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.720
No possessions.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.240
You just moved in and your room is just empty except for a bed.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.360
Okay, huh?

26:52.560 --> 26:53.360
That's it.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.720
Oh, you don't have a follow up.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.680
So that's the end of my thought.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.280
He's like a wonderer.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.080
What are people going to think?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.760
Roams from college to college.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.400
They're going to think that he's the pretender and that nobody knows his real face.

27:04.400 --> 27:04.960
Oh, shit.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.760
The pretender.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.440
You're saying the pretender ploy.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.320
I think that I haven't seen that well implemented since the early 90s,

27:10.320 --> 27:11.920
but it could definitely still work.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.080
And even then it wasn't really well implemented.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.680
Not terribly well implemented.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.440
Occasionally well acted, never terribly well written.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.040
Had a big problem getting reliable guest stars.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.720
And the plot was kind of a one trick.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.040
And the main actor kind of looked like David Copperfield.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.720
A little bit like David Copperfield.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.040
Just some helpful notes.

27:31.040 --> 27:37.760
The pretender that you can ingest and use next time.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.880
The next series.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.920
The new pretender.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.800
Starring Shia LaBeouf.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.200
Is it time?

27:45.200 --> 27:45.440
Yes.

27:45.440 --> 27:45.760
Yes.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.760
It's time to take a trip together.

27:47.760 --> 28:02.960
To the money zone.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.800
Happy birthday to you.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.360
Using that trademarked.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.000
Trademarked.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.440
I did under 10 seconds.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.800
That's okay, right?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.720
Hey, that song is under 10 seconds.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.280
That whole thing.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.880
Maybe I need a new one.

28:14.880 --> 28:15.680
Hold on, let me see it.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.680
Happy birthday.

28:18.560 --> 28:18.960
There you go.

28:18.960 --> 28:19.360
Song.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.560
Song for Alex birthday.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.320
Gonna get born.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.080
Gonna get born.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.200
In the city.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.000
Good times.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.080
20 years ago birthday.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.560
Birthday June 10th.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.120
Pass that cake fork to me.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.000
Give me some frosting.

28:38.640 --> 28:43.440
Alex wanted us to wish Janelle a happy birthday.

28:43.440 --> 28:49.520
We're putting the jingle horse in front of the message cart.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.480
I don't care.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.480
This is our show.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.280
Fuck it.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.120
Fuck it, right?

28:55.120 --> 28:55.360
Right.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.760
Here's what we know about Janelle.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.400
She works in product development for a toy company.

29:03.120 --> 29:03.680
That's dope.

29:04.240 --> 29:10.720
She enslaves our youth with an insatiable desire for material possessions.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.160
She gets them early.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.920
She gets them deep.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.000
They need that Kromazord.

29:16.000 --> 29:16.960
Yeah, Janelle made that.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.880
And she was never in a podcast until NBNB AM.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.600
And she's a little bit older than Alex.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.000
Kind of.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.480
She's a couple years older.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.960
Alex is 13.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.800
Alex is a 13 year old boy.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.680
That's not true.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.480
Alex is pretty close to her age.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.840
So he wants to wish her a happy real 28th birthday.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.920
And a fake 29th birthday.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.880
He's been joking about her age to friends.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.880
Hey, Alex.

29:48.880 --> 29:49.920
Ladies love that shit.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.800
Hey, Alex, here's a special treat for you.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.680
Here's a bonus.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.720
Check out this wrinkly old broad.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.000
I love you, Janelle.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.520
This is my old lady.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.040
Emphasis on the old.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.320
If you know of any advice podcasts that you enjoy,

30:04.320 --> 30:06.800
we would strongly encourage you to write in and ask

30:06.800 --> 30:08.080
if you should be doing what you're doing.

30:09.040 --> 30:09.920
Sneak preview?

30:09.920 --> 30:11.680
No, you should not.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.640
Also, on the birthday train,

30:15.600 --> 30:19.120
Matt wants to wish his brother Alex a happy 30th birthday.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.320
Three zero.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.360
Dirty 30.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.160
Dirty 30.

30:23.120 --> 30:23.920
Flirty 30.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.400
If it's Alex, you know him.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.360
Shirty 30.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.560
Because that's, it's customary to buy somebody a shirt

30:30.560 --> 30:31.760
on their 30th birthday.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.320
Like a nice Oxford.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.760
And if you get Tweety Bird on it, it's birdy 30.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.320
A birdy, shirty 30.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.120
Here's what we know about it, about Alex, okay?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.080
Different Alex.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.360
Different Alex, not the giver from before.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.640
Now he is the receiver.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.000
He's huge, okay?

30:51.040 --> 30:52.320
Six three.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.840
Got a dog named Talon.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.160
Has a-

30:56.160 --> 30:58.480
Like a thing that, like a sharp foot?

30:59.040 --> 30:59.840
Yeah, I think so.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.320
Sharp hawk foot?

31:00.320 --> 31:01.280
But not spelled that way.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.040
Good at video games.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.480
Street Fighter IV, Mortal Kombat.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.000
He's got all the kicks and punches.

31:06.880 --> 31:07.600
Lives in Boston.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.280
How many, can I ask,

31:09.280 --> 31:10.560
his hadouken technique?

31:10.560 --> 31:11.920
Like, where is it?

31:11.920 --> 31:16.400
Where he likes to go is down, then toward, then punch.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.520
So like for a hadouken?

31:18.080 --> 31:20.000
For like a hadouken, that's his basic game.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.200
That's what he's, where he's at.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.200
That's how I like to do my hadoukens as well.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.280
But he's 30 years old now, and you know what that means.

31:25.280 --> 31:25.920
No more video games.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.520
No more games, put them away.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.120
Legally speaking, you can't play them.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.000
And they've rented a lake house in upstate New York

31:32.720 --> 31:35.440
to celebrate, but they have not rented the lake house,

31:36.240 --> 31:37.440
which I would recommend.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.280
It's an important distinction.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.680
So since we've sort of painted ourselves into a corner

31:43.680 --> 31:46.800
by not being able to use the traditional birthday song,

31:46.800 --> 31:50.080
Griffin, I would ask that you write a song about these two

31:50.880 --> 31:54.320
that sort of bridges the gap, I guess,

31:54.320 --> 31:58.160
between a licensed track and a not-licensed track.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.920
So let's, parameters, because I love those.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.680
It's gotta be a birthday song.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.040
It's gotta be a birthday song.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.560
It has to be like fill in the blanks so that we can use it

32:09.440 --> 32:10.560
for future birthdays.

32:11.200 --> 32:16.720
Only this time we will fill in the names of Janelle and Alex.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.440
The important thing about this is that it be free to the public.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.040
I don't want to try to get into a copyright battle over this.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.320
I want you to become like the new Applebee's song.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.360
They come out clapping their hands.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.880
What could you be saying right now?

32:32.880 --> 32:34.400
They give you a free piece of birthday cake

32:34.400 --> 32:37.200
and they sing you a song and it's like happy, happy birthday.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.040
Janelle and Alex.

32:41.040 --> 32:41.680
This is confusing.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.880
There's two Alex's in the mix.

32:44.400 --> 32:44.960
Don't worry.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.160
Listen, you've got to let go of Alex 1 and Matt.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.000
It's a gift.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.840
I just purged you from my mind.

32:52.640 --> 32:52.880
Yeah.

32:52.880 --> 32:53.920
You never existed.

32:55.360 --> 33:00.240
This is take one of, I'm going to call it Birthday Town.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.240
Good.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.000
That's a good, good name.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.880
So instead of like waiting to the end of the song to put the names in,

33:06.880 --> 33:08.160
what if we just do it right at the jump?

33:09.040 --> 33:09.280
Okay.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.160
Janelle and Alex.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.240
You are the twin mayors of birthday.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.160
Hold on, here we go.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.280
Did your guitar die?

33:26.560 --> 33:27.600
That's all very good.

33:27.600 --> 33:28.640
I'm liking the whole thing.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.840
Janelle and Alex.

33:31.840 --> 33:37.840
You are the twin suns that shine on birthday planet.

33:40.800 --> 33:46.080
Where it is everybody's birthday every time you go around.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.520
One of you is 28.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.400
The other one of you is dirty 30.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.320
But just because you're old doesn't mean

34:00.320 --> 34:03.600
you don't know how to get down.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.120
Hooray!

34:07.120 --> 34:09.600
Hooray for Birthday Town!

34:09.600 --> 34:11.520
I don't know that we can ever use that again.

34:12.240 --> 34:15.040
Well, we have to because that's the law.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.600
I like, I like twin suns.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.760
Although I guess it only works if we have two birthdays at the same time.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.480
Well, next time we have double birthdays, we'll take them to Birthday Town.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.240
Oh, double birthday would have been a good song.

34:26.240 --> 34:28.880
Double birthday would have been a very good song.

34:28.880 --> 34:32.160
But see, that's why I keep, I make the swan pay for my pearls now.

34:32.160 --> 34:33.840
I don't just throw them out for free.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.400
That's my personal copywriting idea.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.480
Hey, Janelle and Alex, see you next year.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.560
Hey, see you guys next year.

34:40.560 --> 34:44.560
If you know someone that has a birthday coming up or a special message,

34:45.680 --> 34:47.760
you can do personal, you can do business.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.800
Contact Teresa at Maximumfun.org.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.760
It's Teresa with an H and let her know and we can get that all set up.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.320
And you too can have an amazing jingle.

34:56.320 --> 35:01.040
If you think you might want to do it though, get in contact with her early.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.720
We've had a couple people who've wanted to do something for a special occasion.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.560
But we're, we're, we, like for the next couple of months, we're booked.

35:10.560 --> 35:15.200
So getting, get in contact with her with plenty of lead time and we'll, we'll figure it out.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.280
Here we go.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.400
I was coming home late from the bar the other night.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.680
My cute neighbor and a few of her friends were sitting on a porch drinking,

35:23.680 --> 35:25.520
but I was unaware of this at first.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.080
As I was walking to my door, I ripped a fierce one.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.440
It was loud enough that it echoed down my street.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.240
Holy Christ.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.400
And that's when I heard my neighbor and her friend start laughing.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.680
I can't imagine fucking shattered windows.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.840
Quiet alarms are going off.

35:42.720 --> 35:47.120
I was extremely embarrassed, appropriate, and got inside the house as fast as I could.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.880
Is this something that will haunt me forever?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.720
Or if I just avoid her for a couple of weeks, will she forget?

35:52.720 --> 35:53.680
Tootin in Tennessee.

35:53.680 --> 35:53.920
Nope.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.040
Nope.

35:55.040 --> 35:55.600
Nope.

35:55.600 --> 35:55.840
Nope.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.800
Maybe it's time for you to become like not tooting in Texas.

36:00.800 --> 36:06.240
Just normal in Nebraska.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.880
You got to absorb this experience.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.160
Holding it in Hawaii.

36:12.320 --> 36:16.400
You got to eat this experience and you got to keep it ever present in your mind.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.320
Cause you fucked up, man.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.320
Oh, did you goof?

36:20.880 --> 36:21.600
Oh man.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.480
Is that never a goof?

36:22.480 --> 36:27.600
One time I was on a city bus going to college and I completely forgot that I was in public.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.280
I had a huge fart.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.560
And so then I bought a car.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.880
He could never go back to the bus system.

36:35.760 --> 36:39.280
The whole, the whole public transportation game was shut down.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.520
There's a picture of him on every Oklahoma city bus.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.160
It's a do not let this man on your bus.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.840
The driver's come to refer to him as stinky Carl.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.960
We do not know his real name or his locale.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.760
But he has mega toots.

36:56.640 --> 37:02.880
They, uh, when Travis finally did sell that car, they, the car dealership ramped it into a chasm.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.800
They're like, we can't sell this to anyone.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.080
This is a biohazard.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.200
What have you done in here?

37:07.840 --> 37:09.280
You're, you were killing us.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.760
Um, yeah, you can't.

37:13.360 --> 37:13.920
No, you know what?

37:13.920 --> 37:19.600
Unless you do something like either a far more embarrassing.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.960
I mean, you've really got to take it to the limit where I'm talking like,

37:22.960 --> 37:28.720
say something, uh, super racist around the person who's race is being belittled.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.800
I mean, like a goof on that scale.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.600
Is that better?

37:31.600 --> 37:32.800
I don't think so.

37:32.800 --> 37:37.680
Can you, can you fall out of your window while jerking it and land on her porch?

37:37.680 --> 37:39.760
Is that as far as I can tell us?

37:39.760 --> 37:41.200
And continue jerking it.

37:41.920 --> 37:42.400
Yeah.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.160
You have two options.

37:44.800 --> 37:49.280
You can either fall out of your, her window, your window while jerking it and land on her porch.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.320
And then you're that guy.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.680
Or you fall out your window and fly and no one will ever,

37:54.240 --> 37:55.920
ever talk about the flatulence again.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.080
You know what I think you should do?

37:58.640 --> 37:59.600
Just go right up.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.520
Of course the plot of the boy who could fly.

38:02.720 --> 38:05.760
Go right up to her door, ring that doorbell and she answers the door.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.800
Be like, it happened.

38:06.800 --> 38:07.520
Okay.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.800
Like it happened.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.000
And I want to move on.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Do you, can we please move on from this?

38:12.640 --> 38:14.320
My name is Tootin in Tennessee.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.440
I'm a person.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.240
I'm a man.

38:16.240 --> 38:21.280
I saw a copy of the newsletter you sent out and I do not appreciate it.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.720
I think you just got to grab this bull by the horns and you got to.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.760
Fart in its face.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.640
And you got to fart right in.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.840
You got to just handle it.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.960
Just handle it.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.160
Cause you can't live in fear.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.960
If you do that, then the terrorists won.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.600
I think you should go knock on her door and say,

38:36.160 --> 38:40.000
I just went to the doctor and turns out I have butt diabetes.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.400
So you were laughing at my medical condition that is going to claim my life.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.400
So sleep well tonight.

38:46.400 --> 38:50.880
I have a tiny goblin that lives in my stomach who is slowly killing me,

38:50.880 --> 38:52.800
but he also makes me fart.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.080
That's what the doctor said.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.440
Do you want to see my x-rays?

38:56.000 --> 38:56.880
I'm your man.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.680
I'm a person.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.440
I'm a person.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.240
I wanted you to know that.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.160
I'm not just some fart clown for you.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.880
Nothing's a fart machine.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.400
I have a fart goblin.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.080
God damn it, Susan.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.120
And it's killing me.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.200
I want you to know that a few years back I invited Jesus to live in my heart.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.800
So which one of us were you laughing at?

39:14.800 --> 39:15.300
Exactly.

39:16.160 --> 39:16.960
He's in here too.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.480
Just so you know.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.760
Enjoy hell, Susan.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.640
Enjoy hell, Susan.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.600
And then fart again.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.560
And then do a little, do like a brief jig and then leave.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.840
And then move away.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.520
The first time was an accident.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.520
This time has to be intentional for you to get the power back in the relationship.

39:37.520 --> 39:46.400
Every day, for the next month, greet her in the morning as she steps up to the paper like,

39:46.400 --> 39:47.440
hey neighbor.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.880
And then you're standing on the porch with a cup of coffee and your bathrobe.

39:50.880 --> 39:51.760
And you just blast it.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.040
And then you fart and the bathrobe flutters.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.000
And you say, see you tomorrow at eight.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.440
You're saying fart stalker, basically.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.360
I think fart stalker was Gared McGavin's finest performance.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.720
Oh, man.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.360
That was too bad.

40:08.080 --> 40:08.480
I'm sorry.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.120
You do have to move.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.800
I've gone out four times with this girl.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.440
I'm 16.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.160
She's 15.

40:14.160 --> 40:14.480
Gross.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.320
Things are going great.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.000
We always have a great time.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.040
I have not kissed her yet.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.960
Since it would be both of our first kisses, I want to make it perfect.

40:22.960 --> 40:23.460
Aww.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.640
Problem is, I'm fairly new to the dating game.

40:26.640 --> 40:31.440
I'm not sure when I can approach the topic of going steady and becoming a couple.

40:31.440 --> 40:35.120
Please help me in being Ben from sunny Germany.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.160
I almost feel like we should just skip it.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.840
Because we're going to ruin this.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.720
We're going to ruin you, Ben.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.560
Like a rabbit in a mice of men.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.880
You know, you pet it too hard and the neck snaps.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.600
Yes, that is exactly true, Travis.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.800
That is the perfect analogy.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.280
Ben, you've brought something very precious to us.

40:53.920 --> 40:57.840
And if you give this to us, if you give us this thing to care for for you,

40:57.840 --> 41:01.600
you will come back in a week and it will be, you'll be like, what's that smell?

41:01.600 --> 41:03.360
Like, yeah, that was the precious thing that you gave us.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.000
We killed it and we buried it underneath the sink.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.200
We did a bad job with this precious thing you gave us.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.200
We hugged it too hard and it's been dead for a while.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.120
And Ben, we're so sorry.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.520
I have a confession to make.

41:17.520 --> 41:22.000
The only reason I still host this show with you guys is that for an hour every week,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.240
I can remember what it's like to feel this way.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.200
Oh my God.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.880
To feel, just to, yeah.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.200
Yeah, it's like, it's vicarious.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.280
Vicarious innocence is, it's addictive.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.760
Do you think he's, do you think he's held her hand yet?

41:33.760 --> 41:34.560
Ah, man.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.520
I can't even think about it.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.240
It's too chaste.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.560
Oh, Ben.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.320
Do you think that like one of their dads drives them to the movies?

41:42.320 --> 41:43.680
I can't think about it.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.400
Oh.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.920
I can't because I think about it.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.520
Do you think she spins on his dick?

41:51.040 --> 41:52.720
Ben, this is what we're talking about.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.240
If we go any further, then I am going to suggest that you make her spin.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.160
She should spin on it.

41:58.160 --> 41:58.640
Like.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.920
It's not worth a spin on it, Ben.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.600
This is what we do, Ben.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.920
We don't have, there's not a different setting.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.360
We're going to kill your thing, this precious thing you brought us.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.080
All right, let's try it.

42:08.080 --> 42:08.800
Let's hold it down.

42:09.360 --> 42:09.860
Okay.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.480
You got to go slow because this is the most terrifying thing you've done so far.

42:15.440 --> 42:15.940
Yes.

42:16.640 --> 42:20.640
Yeah, and it will be terrifying right up until the moment when you do it,

42:20.640 --> 42:22.000
and then it won't be so scary.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.760
Ben, I have a new mindset for you, and this should apply to everybody.

42:29.200 --> 42:37.760
Fear is only applicable to things that are in the future that you can't figure out.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.680
If you knew exactly what was going to happen, you wouldn't be afraid of it.

42:42.480 --> 42:46.160
So fear only limits you if you're trying to guess the future.

42:46.160 --> 42:50.960
If you are in the immediate, if you're in the here and now, you can never be afraid of anything

42:50.960 --> 42:53.360
because you're just experiencing it as it comes.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.960
And also, think about it this way.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.080
You're, what, 16?

42:57.440 --> 42:59.680
No one is expecting you to succeed.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.280
Yeah, you're going to fail this time.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.200
You're going to be super bad at it.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.480
A lot of times you're going to fail.

43:04.480 --> 43:07.600
So there is zero pressure on you whatsoever.

43:07.600 --> 43:13.280
Like, this is the time that you try things and you learn what, you know,

43:13.280 --> 43:15.920
what you do in relationships and what's best for you.

43:15.920 --> 43:20.000
And so, man, you're just not going to be good at this first time, but nobody is.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.080
Nobody's good at it at 16.

43:23.920 --> 43:28.560
My first kiss was my freshman year of high school playing Spin the Bottle.

43:28.560 --> 43:38.320
I received it from a acne scarred girl from the flag corps because this was a band party.

43:38.320 --> 43:43.440
And it happened on the dirty floor of a kitchen in the west end of Huntington.

43:43.440 --> 43:50.160
So, Justin, that is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. As long as you can top that,

43:50.160 --> 43:52.800
if you can top that magic, that romance.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.080
Don't remember her name, by the way.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.760
Only vaguely remember what her first name was. Flaggy.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.800
Flaggy the Kissmabot.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.840
If you can beat that for romance,

44:01.840 --> 44:05.680
then you are well on your way to a special moment in your marriage forever.

44:05.680 --> 44:09.760
Justin, I think the only way that he could not top that romantically

44:09.760 --> 44:14.000
is if during his first kiss he had beef jerky in his mouth.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.000
Is that what I think it is?

44:18.000 --> 44:18.320
It is.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.400
Uh, goddammit, this is so adorable.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.160
Can we just take a moment and just, like,

44:24.160 --> 44:27.360
soak in this beautiful moment of the human experience?

44:28.400 --> 44:31.120
Somewhere in Germany, Ben just said a lot,

44:31.120 --> 44:35.440
God, I feel a lot less innocent and less special like someone who's drinking it.

44:35.440 --> 44:42.320
Someone who's drinking my naivete and turning it into evil. So we hope that helps, Ben.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.120
I don't want to give you any more-

44:43.120 --> 44:44.800
Don't listen to us whatsoever.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.760
Just don't do anything we say and you'll be off the races.

44:48.480 --> 44:55.360
Do you guys know that in addition to it being fat beach con time-

44:55.360 --> 44:56.480
Goddammit.

44:56.480 --> 45:00.080
It is also the first show that we've done in the month of June.

45:01.120 --> 45:04.240
I want to jump back real quick and say that there was someone on Twitter

45:04.240 --> 45:08.880
that got really mad at us because last week's episode did not contain the monthly thing.

45:08.880 --> 45:09.920
It was still May, dawg.

45:09.920 --> 45:10.480
Hey, buddy.

45:11.120 --> 45:18.080
How about, um, uh, okay, I picked it out ahead of time so we didn't have to do the list thing.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.720
Celibacy Awareness Month.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.000
Oh, good.

45:23.600 --> 45:27.360
So we, in case people are unfamiliar, maybe you're just now joining us,

45:28.320 --> 45:33.600
can you explain the premise of this, this, this bit you keep, uh, uh, uh-

45:33.600 --> 45:34.560
Well, every-

45:34.560 --> 45:35.760
Subjecting us to-

45:35.760 --> 45:42.960
Every month there is important issues that everybody has to stay on top of.

45:43.840 --> 45:50.000
Um, important things like, um, uh, Fireworks Safety Month.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.600
June is also Fireworks Safety Month.

45:51.600 --> 45:56.480
I would say maybe save that one for July when everyone uses all the goddamn fireworks.

45:57.120 --> 46:00.400
You gotta get to them so early though in July is a thing.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.680
June you have a whole month to be a dick about it.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.440
So this month is, what is, what is this month, Griffin?

46:07.440 --> 46:09.520
It is Celibacy Awareness Month.

46:10.720 --> 46:11.280
Okay.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.000
Our previous question dovetails nicely into this.

46:14.000 --> 46:14.240
Yes.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.480
I'm aware that somewhere someone is celibate and it brings me great joy.

46:18.480 --> 46:22.800
Okay, uh, so how about Celibacy Awareness Month?

46:22.800 --> 46:27.040
Don't make us switch to Celibacy Enforcement Month, my brother, my brother, and me.

46:27.040 --> 46:32.800
Celibacy Awareness Month, that's one excuse.

46:32.800 --> 46:33.760
My brother, my brother, and me.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.880
Um, Celibacy Awareness Month.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.480
Don't get your dick wet, my brother, my brother, and me.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.200
That's pretty good.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.640
Keep that dick dry, my brother, my brother, and me.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.240
Just jerk it, you goof.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.360
My brother, my brother, and me.

46:49.360 --> 46:55.280
What ever happened to watching secretly from the bushes, my brother, my brother, and me?

46:57.840 --> 46:58.340
Uh.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.560
There's always dry humping, my brother, my brother, and me.

47:04.800 --> 47:05.040
Hey.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.480
Celibacy Awareness Month.

47:06.480 --> 47:10.080
Because Jesus is always watching, my brother, my brother, and me.

47:10.080 --> 47:14.160
Hey, were you aware that there are people who don't fuck?

47:14.880 --> 47:16.000
My brother, my brother, and me.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.880
Okay, a little on the nose maybe.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.240
A little, sort of like, yeah, like a little direct.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.080
But I definitely think that there's, um.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.920
I don't care if you're married, my brother, my brother, and me.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.400
Celibacy Awareness Month.

47:30.400 --> 47:34.400
It's like that movie, 40 days and 40 nights, only 10 days shorter.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.720
My brother, my brother, and me.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.360
Celibacy Awareness Month.

47:41.360 --> 47:47.760
It seems to be working out okay for babies.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.800
They're happy and shit.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.480
My brother, my brother, and me.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.080
Oh, man.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.040
Celibacy Awareness Month.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.440
It's the only way to get super good at kung fu.

47:57.440 --> 48:03.680
Celibacy Awareness Month.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.400
It's true.

48:04.400 --> 48:09.520
I thought it was true.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.880
Oh, I think that was a good ender.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.720
I think we cashed it on kung fu.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.760
Yeah, good.

48:17.760 --> 48:22.400
I was trying to come up with one about that involved the phrases

48:22.400 --> 48:25.280
celibacy awareness life and Verne Troyer.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.560
I decided to just let it go.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.680
It works both ways.

48:31.680 --> 48:34.320
One, he's going to die without knowing the touch of a woman,

48:34.320 --> 48:36.240
presumably in the next couple of years.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.240
And B, if his parents have been celibate,

48:38.240 --> 48:40.720
that's one less thing we got to worry about.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.520
How much time do you spend worrying about Verne Troyer?

48:44.640 --> 48:49.280
Well, how much time do you spend with your eyes at regular human level?

48:49.280 --> 48:51.840
You would be unaware of a Verne Troyer attack.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.000
So like Verne Troyer Awareness Month.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.400
Verne Troyer Awareness always, because where is he?

48:58.400 --> 48:58.880
Right now.

48:58.880 --> 49:03.040
Can we get a tag on him or something?

49:03.680 --> 49:04.160
Can we?

49:05.280 --> 49:08.160
God, this garbage can is heavier than I thought it would be stabbed.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.720
He was in there the whole time.

49:11.280 --> 49:12.320
You just got burned.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.000
You got burned.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
This phone booth seems surprisingly crowded.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.440
I didn't anticipate stab.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.560
Did that teddy bear just move?

49:20.560 --> 49:20.960
Stab.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.400
Stab.

49:22.400 --> 49:27.280
My mileage has been really moderately worse than normal.

49:27.280 --> 49:27.760
Stab.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.400
Backseat.

49:28.400 --> 49:28.960
The whole time.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.760
We're not jibing him because of his size.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.160
He is a despicable human being.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.440
That's not a good person.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.600
As anybody who's watched this in real life can attest.

49:41.280 --> 49:41.760
Yeah.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.120
I want to hear Gervin's last question.

49:43.120 --> 49:48.000
But first, I want to say that nbnbam.com is a website that you can go to

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and visit and experience for yourselves.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.840
At nbnbam is our Twitter thing.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.400
You can follow us.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.520
We're almost to 4K.

49:55.520 --> 50:01.440
And whoever is the 4000th will be the 4000th one.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.480
Mr. 4000.

50:03.200 --> 50:03.440
Yeah.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.360
Like that movie with Bernie Mac.

50:05.360 --> 50:06.480
God rest his soul.

50:06.480 --> 50:07.520
Oh, it really brought it down.

50:08.400 --> 50:08.800
Yeah.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.480
Hey, Bernie Mac's dead, everyone.

50:10.480 --> 50:10.800
Bye.

50:11.680 --> 50:12.160
Bye.

50:12.160 --> 50:13.040
Hope you liked our show.

50:14.160 --> 50:17.120
We have a voicemail that we haven't talked about in a while.

50:17.120 --> 50:18.400
Griffin, do you remember the number?

50:18.400 --> 50:19.360
Do you listen to that?

50:19.920 --> 50:20.480
I do not.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.160
But that's only because nobody calls it.

50:22.160 --> 50:25.440
So what's the number?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.960
203-mbnbam1.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.480
If you want to just talk like into my ear, like slow,

50:30.480 --> 50:35.680
because I'm celebrating National Celibacy Awareness Month

50:35.680 --> 50:38.240
and I can really use the ear company.

50:38.240 --> 50:38.480
Yeah.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.960
So get in touch with Griffin.

50:40.960 --> 50:45.760
Ladies, if you want to give him some of the dirty stuff, that's cool, too.

50:45.760 --> 50:48.800
It's just read recipes, but do it like softly.

50:48.800 --> 50:52.400
Yeah, it's like sexy.

50:52.400 --> 50:53.760
What else is going on right now?

50:53.760 --> 51:00.240
We've got a live show in Cincinnati on Sunday, June 12th.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.760
Our next episode is going to be live, so it may be a day or two late.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.680
I'll try to get it up as quick as I can.

51:06.560 --> 51:10.320
Hopefully that won't be an issue, but we'll get it up for you lickety split.

51:11.600 --> 51:16.000
If you're going to be at the show and you would like a question read there,

51:16.000 --> 51:20.320
you can send it in and make sure to put Cincinnati in the subject line.

51:22.480 --> 51:23.600
Start sending those in now.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.040
We'll be building the list pretty soon.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.120
So if you're going to be at the show, let us know.

51:28.240 --> 51:32.720
It's our first full-length live show, so we're going to need as much shit as we can.

51:32.720 --> 51:37.120
So if you are like a regular Yaku contributor, like I'm talking to you,

51:37.120 --> 51:40.880
Jacob Locker and Krista Whalen and Galea Ali, like my people.

51:41.760 --> 51:42.880
It's time to really step up.

51:42.880 --> 51:47.600
Little SARS gots to step up your game and just send it to me.

51:47.600 --> 51:50.640
Like, send it to the MBM account every time you see one,

51:51.760 --> 51:53.600
because I could I'm really going to need the help.

51:54.560 --> 52:03.120
We love seeing people talking about us on the Twitter using the MBM hashtag.

52:04.240 --> 52:09.440
Galea Ali, for instance, just said that she's disappointed that I'm on that like a dog mat.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.800
Never made it into our lexicon, so maybe we can bring that back for her.

52:12.800 --> 52:13.360
We just did.

52:14.480 --> 52:15.040
Yeah, there you go.

52:16.640 --> 52:17.680
Bethany is awake.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.880
Joanna 11 has been talking about the show a lot.

52:20.880 --> 52:25.120
We really appreciate Babylonian.

52:25.120 --> 52:29.440
He's sort of a new convert, but he's been spreading the word to people.

52:30.720 --> 52:31.600
We love that.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.600
By the way, if you could just tell a friend to listen,

52:34.160 --> 52:38.400
that's the only way we really expand the listener base is through you guys.

52:38.400 --> 52:41.280
So just grab a friend, send them a link to our sampler.

52:41.280 --> 52:45.200
It's bit.ly forward slash it's MBM.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.520
And before I forget, with the live show,

52:47.520 --> 52:50.640
we're going to have some special live show only posters for sale.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.400
Oh, fuck, yes.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.560
So they are absolutely beautiful.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.920
Make sure to bring some cash with you because we're not going to have like

52:57.920 --> 53:01.200
any of them fancy, smancy debit card machines or whatnot.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.480
And bring some extra cash because our buddy Felicia Gillespie

53:04.480 --> 53:06.160
is going to be there selling her CDs and stuff.

53:06.160 --> 53:10.560
And what if she's like supes funny and you need a physical reminder of that?

53:10.560 --> 53:13.280
It's when she is when she is supes funny,

53:13.280 --> 53:16.160
you will feel compelled to purchase her wares.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.520
One or more of her wares.

53:18.720 --> 53:21.040
After the show, we're going to Arnold's Bar and Grill,

53:21.040 --> 53:25.600
oldest bar in Cincinnati and absolute best bar in the world.

53:25.600 --> 53:26.240
So check it out.

53:26.240 --> 53:28.560
Gonna get drunk with my dad.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.840
It's going to be sick.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.000
Yeah, it's going to be really low.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.840
And hey, if you're if you're at E3 this week and you see me or Justin, say hi.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.440
If you see Travis, holy shit.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.240
How did you do that?

53:40.240 --> 53:40.880
Because he's not there.

53:41.840 --> 53:42.720
He's not there.

53:42.720 --> 53:43.120
He's not.

53:43.120 --> 53:43.840
It's not Travis.

53:43.840 --> 53:44.640
That's Hideo Kojima.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.240
It's someone doing Travis cosplay.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.600
More than you'd think actually there.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.440
Oh, we're going to have new T-shirts super soon.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.600
So big things.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.000
Storms, storms of Bruin.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.280
Storm of merch is a Bruin.

53:59.280 --> 54:02.240
And they still have some stuff on Level Up.

54:03.280 --> 54:03.920
Yes.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.400
Search for Level Up Studios and you'll see some of our,

54:07.040 --> 54:08.400
I think the red T-shirt is still there.

54:08.400 --> 54:09.920
So get up on it.

54:09.920 --> 54:13.440
Also, we want to wish a hearty get well soon to Carl.

54:14.560 --> 54:18.560
I'm a Bim Bam fan who is laid out in the hospital right now.

54:18.560 --> 54:21.920
But Carl, you get feeling better and we're all thinking about you, buddy.

54:23.040 --> 54:23.520
Griffin.

54:24.800 --> 54:25.360
I'm ready.
