00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.660 --> 00:50.660
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.940 --> 00:55.940
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.500 --> 01:02.500
It's better, it's better with you

01:02.500 --> 01:09.500
It's better, it's better with you

01:11.500 --> 01:17.060
Here's a yahoo that was sent in by Matt Estevez. Thank you, Matt. It's by yahoo answers user Yoville

01:18.220 --> 01:20.220
posted in arts and humanities

01:20.340 --> 01:22.340
history

01:22.620 --> 01:26.940
Yoville asks, what are the ranks in the Illuminati?

01:28.240 --> 01:30.240
Name all of the ranks or anything

01:30.240 --> 01:35.520
They name all of the ranks or anything they use to describe theirself as

01:37.920 --> 01:45.900
Well, there's the Bluebirds and the Cardinals and the Bluebirds are the more advanced Illuminati and the Cardinals are the ones that need

01:45.900 --> 01:47.560
some help

01:47.560 --> 01:53.640
Is that some red wall shit? No, it's like a that's like elementary school stuff. I

01:53.640 --> 01:59.720
I think that if anyone answers this question, then they're not Illuminati

02:00.160 --> 02:05.500
Because they would know better than yeah, because they would know better than to reveal the secrets

02:06.180 --> 02:09.320
Let me bounce something that yahoo answers user armor

02:10.760 --> 02:12.760
armor world

02:13.400 --> 02:15.400
Responded with very helpful stuff from wrong

02:15.400 --> 02:22.720
They said the leader of the Earth's Illuminati. So that's a pretty fucking crazy six words right there

02:24.040 --> 02:27.520
The leader of the Earth's Illuminati is called the Pindar

02:28.480 --> 02:35.400
Cool, the Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling Illuminati families and is always male. That's kind of fucked up

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
but

02:36.400 --> 02:38.080
It's 2014

02:38.080 --> 02:41.880
But really now there's probably a good reason for that in this next sentence

02:41.880 --> 02:47.080
The title Pindar is an abbreviated term for pinnacle of the Draco

02:47.360 --> 02:52.560
Also known as the penis of the dragon. Ah, I was so hoping that's what it would be

02:53.120 --> 02:57.080
The penis of the dragon is probably my favorite Stephen King book

02:57.180 --> 03:04.000
He doesn't get a lot of credit, but I'm deeply into it. Yeah. All hail me the penis of the dragon

03:04.000 --> 03:08.600
Why are you giggling? Why are you all giggling? You're the worst Illuminati Scott

03:08.600 --> 03:10.600
Scott

03:10.840 --> 03:12.800
Scott Illuminati

03:12.800 --> 03:16.520
Scott Illuminati, I hear you giggling underneath your innate mask

03:17.320 --> 03:23.640
It must be so frustrating to be a member of the Illuminati as everybody is like just spreading out this shit and you want to say

03:23.640 --> 03:27.280
Like hey, that's not true. That's not how it's work. It's gooch of the dragon

03:28.320 --> 03:32.400
I'm the goochess, but you I am the goochess of Earth's Illuminati

03:32.400 --> 03:40.280
Wouldn't it be hard to be the penis of the dragon and then somebody cuts in line in front of you at the Chinese buffet

03:40.280 --> 03:44.280
And you're like cuz they want the last the coconut shrimp and you're like

03:44.480 --> 03:44.980
Hey

03:44.980 --> 03:49.720
You better not do that and they look at you why and you got and you just have to stare at the floor

03:49.720 --> 03:54.580
It's like I can't I never mind, but you better not do it. I'm the penis

03:56.760 --> 03:59.240
I'm the enus pay of the agandre

03:59.240 --> 04:03.100
Just pay you just make a triangle with your fingers

04:03.360 --> 04:09.440
Get it get it and then you put that triangle close to your crotch to make it look like a penis tip

04:09.440 --> 04:11.440
And then you flap your wings like a dragon

04:13.120 --> 04:16.440
The shrimp is yours you win I'm leaving

04:17.880 --> 04:20.320
There do have to be like certain levels of

04:20.880 --> 04:26.320
Illuminati you can't just start as like full-fledged like on the the council Illuminati

04:26.320 --> 04:28.320
You've got to start as like junior Illuminati, right?

04:28.320 --> 04:33.280
I think there's a sure-fire like I don't know how anybody finds out about it

04:33.280 --> 04:39.080
But I've seen the yahoo's that drew Davenport since in if that cat has not found how to get into the Illuminati yet

04:39.080 --> 04:43.360
I don't think anybody ever well, yeah, it seems like he probably would have unearthed it by now

04:44.280 --> 04:50.580
Well, but how are you just are you suggesting Travis that maybe there's like an Illuminati Awana's program?

04:51.880 --> 04:53.400
Illuminati

04:53.400 --> 04:58.880
Brownies or something. Yeah, like you're a Cub Scout Illuminati, you know, you start you're making Pinewood Derby first

04:58.880 --> 05:04.080
And then ten years later, you're ruling the world. You're controlling all the bank cartels and shit

05:04.440 --> 05:05.640
Yeah

05:05.640 --> 05:10.320
They're not just gonna like first day Illuminati hand you the reins to the American government

05:10.680 --> 05:13.460
Yeah, I won't even admit that you're in it

05:14.080 --> 05:17.720
First you gotta be really careful. They want to admit the Illuminati existence

05:17.720 --> 05:21.360
So you're a couple ranks in sometimes it's just people trying to trick you out of your rent money

05:21.360 --> 05:24.360
So wait, am I in the Illuminati or not? Well, I guess

05:25.720 --> 05:29.880
Six months in it's like hey, you didn't show up to our bowling game on Tuesday

05:29.880 --> 05:33.720
Oh, so it is a bowling league fuck guess wrong again shit

05:34.080 --> 05:36.240
Do you think when you start off in the Illuminati?

05:36.240 --> 05:40.280
They let you like control a student government and I just see how you do it

05:41.880 --> 05:45.400
The first the first thing you control is is a fantasy football

05:45.400 --> 05:49.600
That's where you start in the Illuminati, but no one can know about it

05:49.760 --> 05:54.780
My name is Scott Jenkins and I'm running for Huntington High School's tip of the Dragon Penis

05:57.240 --> 05:59.240
Just a tip please vote Scott

06:01.680 --> 06:07.120
I'm gonna sort down the lunch signs on Taco Tuesday vote for me for Dragon Penis

06:07.120 --> 06:09.120
I

06:15.160 --> 06:18.420
Seen you run in the halls. I have cameras everywhere

06:20.320 --> 06:25.480
Scott the principal comes to him in a robe. Tell me what to do

06:28.760 --> 06:30.760
Milkshake machine

06:30.760 --> 06:35.840
It's really the final level of adulthood and

06:36.840 --> 06:41.920
You you may think that you are ready for it when when you actually buy a house

06:42.080 --> 06:49.240
You are not ready for it because it's still very bizarre to me that there are whole areas in my house

06:49.240 --> 06:52.160
If I open a door to them and I look at them

06:52.160 --> 06:58.760
I don't know what they do like I don't know what they are or like why they are I had a thing

06:58.760 --> 07:04.200
Do you live in the Winchester house? What are you talking about? No open a door to a closet. You're like, what is this?

07:04.200 --> 07:07.920
No, I'm talking. Okay. I'll give you an example a couple weeks ago

07:07.920 --> 07:10.040
I went down to turn the furnace on for the first time

07:10.040 --> 07:11.960
I guess it would have been a month or so ago now

07:11.960 --> 07:15.760
I go down and turn the furnace on for the first time and I see this thing called that

07:15.760 --> 07:19.160
There's like a humidifier that sort of like built into

07:19.600 --> 07:24.760
The system there that like as far as I know I've never used and I was like, whoa

07:24.760 --> 07:30.960
I could be having more humid air this whole time, but I didn't really know how it works. I kind of turned some things and

07:32.320 --> 07:37.640
Open a valve and did all that kind of business and I was like, hmm. Okay humidity

07:37.640 --> 07:39.920
Oh boy, I go down three days later

07:40.040 --> 07:46.960
My basement carpet is fucking soaked like literally standing water in my basement carpet water

07:46.960 --> 07:54.740
Everywhere because this thing just apparently it's like humidifying GM is just spitting water randomly. Yeah, so I've ruined my house

07:54.960 --> 07:59.200
So you just boarded up the basement and you call that one. I don't yeah, I don't have that

07:59.320 --> 08:01.320
It really is a weird island

08:02.520 --> 08:06.400
It really is weird like how many times have you been in your attic Justin?

08:08.240 --> 08:14.620
Twice a year once to get the Christmas lights out and once to put them back. Okay, I've been in our attic twice

08:14.620 --> 08:18.040
once when we like right when we moved in and then

08:18.440 --> 08:21.960
Again, when our HVAC unit up there stopped working and that was after that

08:21.960 --> 08:27.480
We had roofers come and replace every single shingle on our roof a month after we moved in home ownership fucking rules you guys

08:27.880 --> 08:33.840
And I realized that in nailing those new shingles in they had turned our attic

08:34.440 --> 08:37.920
into a fucking hellraiser pain box

08:38.680 --> 08:40.680
because there are

08:40.680 --> 08:45.560
Infinity nails coming through the ceiling. It's like it's like a goddamn Iron Maiden up there

08:45.560 --> 08:49.000
So no, I don't think I don't think I will ever be going into that room again. Thanks

08:49.000 --> 08:55.160
What on earth were you planning to do about your broken HVAC unit when you went up there?

08:55.160 --> 09:02.080
I thought I got what was your did you think there would be a switch that said broken and you would just flip it to?

09:02.240 --> 09:06.920
Fixed like is that is that what you were hoping for? He was gonna reason with it. I went up there

09:06.920 --> 09:13.180
I was using my phone's flashlight and I had a fucking hex wrench from an Ikea cabinet. I had bought and so

09:13.680 --> 09:20.000
Ready to do battle with it like seeing what I could do up just surveying the you know what?

09:20.340 --> 09:25.660
Yeah, honey. I tightened a couple of hex bolts and it started working again. Apparently just all the hex bolts were loose

09:25.660 --> 09:30.880
You're laughing. I used that fucking hex wrench to fix our garbage disposal. So you don't know anything about shit, dude

09:32.000 --> 09:34.560
It's it is the universal nano tool

09:34.560 --> 09:39.360
Um, what is it? What is this where does it need to know before they get a house?

09:40.240 --> 09:43.460
You don't know you real please realize like you don't know

09:44.000 --> 09:49.920
Be be prepared to be reverted to like baby state especially with like buying a house that process is in

09:50.840 --> 09:55.280
Scrutable I still don't know if I bought this house our realtor. No one's got rid of me yet

09:55.280 --> 09:57.920
Our realtor would just come to us. I can't eat $300 for the

09:57.920 --> 10:03.760
I bet yep. Here you go. Take it. It's yours now. I never had that money

10:03.760 --> 10:08.160
I guess were you buying the house from the ancient ones? Yeah, it was a deep tongue. I

10:09.880 --> 10:13.440
Hear that it's a really I got a really great deal on this house

10:13.440 --> 10:20.040
But except for that though walls are full of rats. Yeah, and the seeping floors there this floor sir. Well, that's Justin's

10:20.040 --> 10:20.740
Oh, yeah

10:20.740 --> 10:26.920
Justin has I would say from my money like I'm so happy being a renter like Teresa and I have have often considered

10:26.920 --> 10:29.840
Homeownership, but like I don't know

10:29.840 --> 10:34.440
I think what's always scared me most about is that like the permanence and I know you can always sell your house

10:34.440 --> 10:36.440
But in this market, it seems like such a

10:37.320 --> 10:41.440
Market the problem with renting is you just put your money into a shitter and you're shitting on it

10:41.440 --> 10:46.000
And then you're flushing it. It's it's insult to injury. How are you paying your rent? Huh?

10:46.200 --> 10:50.320
Is that how you were paying your rent? I pay it to my landlord. Mr. Toilet

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
I

10:55.600 --> 10:58.880
Yeah, it's it's an investment Travis in yourself and your family I

11:01.640 --> 11:07.440
Had a baby this summer so I spent the entirety of nature's bounty of sunlight watching

11:08.280 --> 11:14.880
Canadian Dragon's Den on YouTube watching need to tell me now what that I mean different had the baby not been present

11:14.880 --> 11:22.080
What what yeah, you would have watched American Dragon's Den now I went because we both would have been drunk

11:22.400 --> 11:27.240
That would have been different now. Only one of you can be drunk at a time. You got a tag-team it

11:28.240 --> 11:34.600
Is that how I actually watched all eight seasons? Holy Canadian Dragon's Den on youth. They're all on YouTube

11:34.600 --> 11:39.160
Here's the weirdest thing. There's one episode where it is inexplicably

11:39.160 --> 11:43.560
The only version of this one episode on YouTube is tilted 45 degrees

11:43.560 --> 11:44.920
so

11:44.920 --> 11:49.400
The whole episode is that it's 45 degree tilt and damned if we didn't sit there

11:49.600 --> 11:53.560
With our heads slightly askew and watch that you got it. Yeah, you don't want to miss an episode

11:53.560 --> 11:57.560
You'll be you'll be lost. You just got to make sure you don't get taco neck syndrome

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
James asks

12:05.880 --> 12:09.640
Interview at McDonald's should I eat there before?

12:09.640 --> 12:16.200
So I've got an interview at McDonald's and I've been craving a Big Mac for a while

12:16.560 --> 12:22.800
Will it look good or bad if I buy one right before I have my interview or right after I?

12:25.840 --> 12:28.240
Think you're missing the obvious and it's during

12:29.320 --> 12:33.520
Well, you don't yeah, you keep asking questions. I'm gonna get in on this Big Mac

12:33.520 --> 12:38.760
You purchase it and then you take it into the interview is what you're saying. This is what you're suggesting

12:38.760 --> 12:43.720
Yeah in your pocket, and then you do like a dear mind. I'm now I'm now I'm now I'm now I'm now

12:45.080 --> 12:50.880
Or right after I think right after sends a very good signal where you're like, well, I think this went well so well

12:50.880 --> 12:56.120
In fact, I gotta get those two all-beef patties special sauces cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun

12:56.120 --> 13:02.440
Thank you very much. Say I think it'll be the first of many. Mm-hmm that you will get me for free for working here

13:02.440 --> 13:07.240
It's actually a free food working at McDonald's. Do you think you have to you have to right?

13:07.240 --> 13:12.160
You get the leftover burgers and fries at the end of the night the leftover burgers and they may have the orbit

13:12.160 --> 13:17.520
They throw them in like a grocery bag, but they make them the order cheese. Oh sure. Sure. They do Griffin

13:18.160 --> 13:19.600
Thanks for buying into the hype

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
But that's the thing I think you eat it

13:21.600 --> 13:27.240
Beforehand and you just make the person who's about to interview you watch you eat it to show you what a good burger

13:27.240 --> 13:32.840
Bull you are and watch you enjoy it. Hmm. Oh, yeah dripped on my shirt. I don't care. I

13:32.840 --> 13:37.360
Can't help but notice you got a little bit of dribble on your shirt there. Yeah, there's a good reason for that

13:37.360 --> 13:39.360
Your burgers are fucking delicious

13:40.160 --> 13:42.080
Can you?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
Buy two Big Macs

13:44.680 --> 13:45.600
beforehand

13:45.600 --> 13:52.120
Set them at a table and then like once your manager arrived like the manager arrives you lead him to that table like oh look

13:52.120 --> 13:54.120
Look what we have here

13:54.160 --> 14:00.400
This can be like why that but what have we found and then see if he'll eat it because I've always been curious

14:00.400 --> 14:01.960
I

14:01.960 --> 14:08.320
Can you roll up with a Big Mac and then hold it in front of the person who's interviewing you and just tear it in half

14:10.560 --> 14:17.920
No, I killed one one down right guys, I'll fucking kill every Big Mac in this place

14:19.720 --> 14:25.020
What if okay, okay don't have a Big Mac during your interview

14:25.020 --> 14:31.900
You want to prove something eat like a record number of Big Macs

14:32.340 --> 14:39.220
half him join you at a table with like 20 big and try to set a Big Mac eating world record as

14:39.420 --> 14:46.100
You conduct the interview see now Justin I thought you were gonna say sit down with a bag open up pull out a Whopper

14:46.740 --> 14:52.340
That's what I meant to say, but I said Big Mac the whole time Burger King does the Whoppers, right? Yes

14:52.340 --> 14:55.540
I fucked that whole thing up. Oh, you thought it was

14:56.180 --> 14:57.460
I

14:57.460 --> 15:02.940
Fucked that whole sentence up when I saw my go to Burger King you get a Whopper and bring it back and you tear it in

15:02.940 --> 15:05.900
Half in front of everybody to say I've sacrificed one

15:06.460 --> 15:13.540
This is the sacrifice this McDonald's demanded. I don't eat a lot of fast food. You guys eat mostly ancient grains. Let me

15:14.860 --> 15:19.420
think something that would make a pretty good impression if you're interviewing to be like a

15:19.420 --> 15:24.060
Fry cook and McDonald's is tell them how you would do things differently

15:24.060 --> 15:28.460
Oh, I think you should tell them like how you would spice up the burgers differently or some

15:29.980 --> 15:36.100
Throw in some black bean burgers bring in a big like gallon bag of likes your special spices

15:39.900 --> 15:41.900
It's your current product

15:43.540 --> 15:47.780
Pull an avocado out of your pocket. I want you to taste this burger

15:47.780 --> 15:53.600
I just bought this from your from from the line now. I want you to try this burger. I made you like that

15:54.540 --> 15:58.380
It did take me two and a half hours to make so slow down production

16:06.260 --> 16:08.720
We just wrote good burger

16:08.720 --> 16:17.120
If you put three brothers in front of typewriters for all of eternity one of them will eventually write good burger

16:17.560 --> 16:19.680
That's the law of large numbers. Oh

16:23.200 --> 16:30.360
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling game recognized game. Thank you. Rachel. It's by Yahoo answers user Brian who asks

16:32.200 --> 16:34.200
Why is peepaw so rude

16:34.200 --> 16:39.040
So today I was at my peepaw's household and he sneezed in my face

16:40.920 --> 16:43.280
It's really good then laughed about it

16:43.280 --> 16:49.260
Yeah, he's always doing rude things like this and tripping me and my boyfriend when we walk by and spitting on my ferret

16:52.040 --> 16:56.360
The other day he even picked his nose and wiped his booger on my clothes

16:57.640 --> 16:59.640
Travis Patrick McElroy

16:59.640 --> 17:03.560
These are solid. How can we get him to stop being so rude?

17:04.280 --> 17:05.960
Why?

17:05.960 --> 17:10.780
Spitting on the ferret is out of control. That's some next-level rude grandpa technique

17:13.840 --> 17:20.400
You think your grandpa's rude talking about the war and and just incessantly and talking about his friends and their sacrifices

17:20.580 --> 17:25.200
So rude, my grandpa spits on my ferret. Fuck you. You don't know shit

17:25.200 --> 17:27.200
I

17:27.560 --> 17:31.560
These are all good goofs if I was like this happen, I would I would lose it

17:32.320 --> 17:39.460
Why is this ferret caked in grandpa's pit? I'll tell you why it's good. My jeeps. I I if if I

17:40.360 --> 17:47.840
God willing live to an elderly age. I'm doing this. I'm hitting that power in a heartbeat mores out the window

17:47.840 --> 17:50.520
What are you gonna say? But like this is your kin

17:51.080 --> 17:52.400
Yeah

17:52.400 --> 17:56.000
Shouldn't you be nice to your to your kin? Don't you want them to remember you?

17:56.000 --> 18:00.240
I know how angry I am at people who are younger than me now

18:00.240 --> 18:08.380
Oh, I can only imagine that's gonna be compounded in the intervening decades. Yeah, don't even be young around me. I

18:11.580 --> 18:13.580
Live in an apartment

18:13.940 --> 18:15.940
with a share

18:15.940 --> 18:22.660
Not enough with a shared quite operated laundry unit the washing machine takes 40 minutes the dryer takes one hour

18:22.660 --> 18:30.040
I know this because if you don't set timers and come and get your laundry nice and quick and unknown assailant steals

18:30.900 --> 18:37.420
You come back a couple hours later and the clothes are on the floor in the sink or even the garbage. They're just gone

18:37.980 --> 18:44.060
Other residents have complained about the same thing and having bleach thrown on their drying towels help brothers

18:44.060 --> 18:47.380
What can I do to bring this full of justice and protect my stuff?

18:47.900 --> 18:53.200
It's happened three times now and I'm very low on underwear. That's swing through me on these just real quick

18:53.580 --> 19:01.180
Yeah, that's from got got done down got got done down under I guess. Yeah, you got it

19:01.940 --> 19:03.940
Got it one. Um

19:04.380 --> 19:08.180
Sounds to me like you got yourself a laundry Krampus on your hands. Mm-hmm

19:08.180 --> 19:13.640
I've been watching a lot of leverage recently and I think you just need to set up an elaborate con

19:14.100 --> 19:20.500
Well, it's gonna have to be a fucking super elaborate con to catch a Krampus. That's great. Yeah, I

19:20.940 --> 19:22.940
Missed that show to catch a Krampus

19:24.420 --> 19:26.420
It was doing such good work

19:26.580 --> 19:33.780
You know getting a Krampus. I mean it was too many crap. It was Krampus entrapment and and it's hard to argue that in court

19:33.780 --> 19:34.780
but

19:34.780 --> 19:39.480
But they were doing the Lord's work. What kind of weird dude is like, okay

19:39.480 --> 19:43.380
I just saw someone take your laundry in I'm gonna go through bleach on their towels

19:44.020 --> 19:46.020
That's the only way I can feel

19:46.780 --> 19:48.140
I

19:48.140 --> 19:50.140
Did I used to live in an apartment?

19:50.420 --> 19:52.700
Where everybody kept their detergent?

19:53.300 --> 19:55.140
in the lunchroom

19:55.140 --> 19:58.340
And I so you never had to buy and I did not buy detergent

19:58.340 --> 20:06.100
I look around the room look around the room. If you don't see a Krampus you are the Krampus

20:08.580 --> 20:10.580
Don't don't pick and choose

20:11.220 --> 20:14.860
Adult the lifeblood that you drain out of us. We're giving you food

20:14.860 --> 20:21.260
Eat where you your three-headed giving tree. Mm-hmm. And now that we're just a stump you're gonna sit on us

20:21.340 --> 20:23.340
We also have three butts

20:23.340 --> 20:28.420
That's not important to this story. Why would you need to make that? Why would you need to specify?

20:28.420 --> 20:30.420
I'm just trying to clarify the mental picture

20:31.300 --> 20:36.820
Giving the tree didn't have one but Travis wait, wait, wait, how do you know that Griffin?

20:37.580 --> 20:43.620
Cuz I asked the office I'm gonna think about the fact that giving tree had a but I have read every piece of

20:43.860 --> 20:50.660
Giving tree slash fiction that exists that probably exists, doesn't it? Mm-hmm the giving and taking tree

20:50.660 --> 20:52.660
Hachi-machi

20:53.220 --> 20:55.220
Yep

20:56.980 --> 20:58.980
Okay, Trav you did some some weird

21:01.420 --> 21:03.620
So weird copy positive here my friend

21:09.380 --> 21:14.060
Stump knots and bumps and dents it is it is all

21:15.140 --> 21:17.060
sap and

21:17.060 --> 21:22.420
Ruination no, no, no, no turn it off

21:33.180 --> 21:39.820
A slice is just a sample. Isn't it better just to know how it's affecting me

21:39.820 --> 21:46.420
I'm glad Gervin take this hit no reason no need to ruin it for all no

21:47.380 --> 21:54.500
This is this is oh, this is a legal your friend is absorbing all of this like John coffee from the green

22:01.740 --> 22:03.740
Fuck me. Oh

22:05.000 --> 22:07.420
My god and it ends with okay

22:07.420 --> 22:14.100
There's it's extremely explicit and it is but it ends the way I think the book should end

22:14.100 --> 22:17.460
This is the last sentence and this is actually kind of beautiful the shit before it

22:17.940 --> 22:24.180
Decidedly not beautiful the boy laid down and wrapped himself around his childhood friend and love of his life

22:24.180 --> 22:31.940
Ah with one final sigh of contentment gross and a smile on his face. The boy closed his tired old eyes for the last time

22:31.940 --> 22:38.140
Oh, he dies on the tree that he just fucked with a huge boner and was fucked by

22:38.940 --> 22:40.940
Thank-you-giving tree slash fiction

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
tree to death

22:46.100 --> 22:48.100
Did he is this his last

22:49.620 --> 22:51.620
Last action

22:51.620 --> 22:58.060
Author's note author's note to enhance your reading experience of my tale of love and reconciliation

22:58.060 --> 23:01.740
I suggest that you listen to Jeff Buckley's hallelujah ball reading. Oh, I

23:02.820 --> 23:06.500
Heard there was a secret tree that you could fuck

23:08.020 --> 23:10.660
And all your childhood memories are dead

23:14.820 --> 23:22.320
Brothers my boyfriend's mother recently learned she would be receiving a sizable inheritance. I think it's around 30k. God damn

23:22.320 --> 23:29.960
Yeah, and has decided to spend it by taking my boyfriend myself her her other son her wife her a

23:30.480 --> 23:33.160
Bunch of people on a big family vacation awesome

23:33.840 --> 23:35.440
Except the last time I spoke to her

23:35.440 --> 23:42.200
She was trying to devise between two possibilities the Grand Canyon and Hawaii now brothers

23:42.200 --> 23:46.560
I'm not an outdoor person. I have absolutely no interest in a Grand Canyon vacation

23:46.560 --> 23:50.240
I would love to go to Hawaii, but I know that Hawaii would be

23:50.240 --> 23:56.800
Significantly more expensive especially in terms of paying for my boyfriend and myself as we live on the East Coast and the flights will be twice

23:56.800 --> 24:01.840
As much as for anyone else on the trip, would it be impolite to express my strong preference?

24:02.360 --> 24:10.000
Should I let her take whatever vacation she prefers with her money and that's from craving beaches over canyons in Washington

24:10.000 --> 24:13.840
This is a really good question. And I this is a great question

24:13.840 --> 24:18.640
My first counter question is what is your problem with the Grand Canyon?

24:18.640 --> 24:23.960
It rules. It's giant. It's made of rocks and I've never been there

24:24.560 --> 24:27.160
But I imagine it would blow your tiny mind

24:27.800 --> 24:32.760
Now Travis, I don't think you're the best person to weigh on on this question because if I remember correctly

24:33.280 --> 24:39.040
You are the man who wouldn't drive four hours out of his way to see the Grand Canyon now to be fair Justin

24:39.040 --> 24:43.840
I had a dog and a cat with me. It was the whole thing. It was gonna be a whole deal

24:43.840 --> 24:47.560
We would have had to take them with us and it was like day seven of our cross-country

24:47.560 --> 24:53.320
What is your problem with the Grand Canyon? It's a big hole. It's just a big hole. I

24:54.240 --> 24:58.920
Maybe maybe fill up with water and let me swim in you lake and then we'll talk

24:59.680 --> 25:03.680
Can I Greg can use a shitty lake? It's a shitty dry

25:03.680 --> 25:07.360
We've really turned around on the Grand Canyon since the beginning of this class

25:07.360 --> 25:13.480
This is the very definition of a win-win scenario because if she chooses Hawaii

25:14.240 --> 25:16.240
awesome, you are gonna have a

25:16.240 --> 25:17.680
fucking

25:17.680 --> 25:21.680
Sitcom special episode and it's gonna be amazing and you're gonna love it

25:21.680 --> 25:24.760
You're gonna be the best time ever go to the Grand Canyon gonna save a lot of money

25:24.760 --> 25:30.880
Probably only to spend maybe five G's on that right getting there that leaves 25 G's of this inheritance left over

25:30.880 --> 25:36.400
I have to be very delicate with my next few sentences because I don't want to implicate myself in anything

25:36.760 --> 25:41.360
But as I see it if you want this inheritance to kick your way

25:42.160 --> 25:43.720
you've got

25:43.720 --> 25:50.640
Maybe six or seven people standing in the way and the Grand Canyon while a shitty lake got to be so careful

25:50.640 --> 25:52.640
so carefully here

25:53.200 --> 25:55.200
Is

25:55.520 --> 25:56.760
If

25:56.760 --> 26:02.080
Things let me think Jesus Christ things that fall into it will pick up

26:02.280 --> 26:05.320
Let's call it a fatal amount of inertia

26:07.640 --> 26:10.560
Now I'm not saying anything about

26:10.560 --> 26:17.440
Merit or most foul, but I am saying how quickly can you push six or seven people?

26:17.440 --> 26:22.200
Oh, I'm saying win-win scenario. I'm not saying murder these people if you go to the Grand Canyon

26:22.280 --> 26:27.080
But how much how bad you want this money? Here is one thing now when you don't

26:27.640 --> 26:30.080
Decide to push them into the Grand Canyon. Don't do that

26:33.280 --> 26:39.640
I'm saying you don't do that. Okay, when you don't do that and get them on a line and push them in the Grand Canyon

26:39.640 --> 26:45.280
I have I cannot caution you enough against losing your nerve halfway through

26:50.040 --> 26:55.460
That's no good that that nothing good will come of that. Yeah. Yeah, we're not saying any of that

26:55.460 --> 26:59.280
I'm saying I saw a YouTube video of somebody throwing seven

26:59.840 --> 27:06.320
Watermelons into the Grand Canyon and they did not even come close to surviving the fall

27:06.320 --> 27:12.640
And I'm also saying that watermelons are the most human-like fruit and that's all I'm gonna say

27:13.080 --> 27:17.760
That's just where I stand on the matter. Do you know what this question asker did wrong?

27:18.840 --> 27:21.240
What's after their opportunity for this?

27:21.720 --> 27:28.700
Not not the other thing, but when you were talking with your with your boyfriend's mother, why didn't you say it then?

27:28.880 --> 27:32.920
Why weren't you like, oh Hawaii would be great. Well now because it's hurt I get it

27:32.920 --> 27:37.060
It's her fucking money. You don't want to be like you are not a member of the family

27:37.060 --> 27:41.240
You are dating a member of the family. So it is super not your place to be like no

27:41.240 --> 27:44.840
But the loophole is this it's not like she said Grand Canyon and you said oh

27:45.080 --> 27:48.480
How about Hawaii like she said either Grand Canyon or Hawaii?

27:48.480 --> 27:52.360
All you had to do is like oh Hawaii sounds fun or the Grand Canyon either way, but Hawaii

27:52.360 --> 28:00.080
I've always because it's her it's her 30 stacks. She gets the ball. Oh, Hawaii is I feel like once you

28:00.080 --> 28:06.520
um, uh, once you pay for the Grand Canyon trip, it's pretty much paid for once you go to Hawaii, though

28:06.520 --> 28:12.020
I feel like you're just begging for upsells. But what about the episode a lot? What what about burros?

28:12.840 --> 28:14.840
You got paid for the burros

28:15.720 --> 28:18.300
Burro rental. Yeah. Yeah, very cold donkeys

28:19.080 --> 28:22.920
You gotta get the audio. That was a shitty joke over. Thank you Griffin

28:22.920 --> 28:26.800
No, a lot of people give us give a shit for not recognizing your good jokes

28:26.800 --> 28:31.400
And I'm trying to get better about that, but that also means I'm gonna call you out when you do a fucking terrible

28:31.400 --> 28:35.280
No, cuz it's a burro shot. Just stop it. He's a chili donkey. I

28:38.880 --> 28:44.600
Don't know how much Shanana is is going to track with the humans who listen to your program

28:44.600 --> 28:47.640
but what I would encourage them not to do is

28:49.080 --> 28:52.540
Look too deeply into the Shanana bis

28:52.540 --> 29:02.120
Because there it's not these guys were you know, this is this this is this this fifties Nostalgia Group that

29:03.220 --> 29:04.900
formed in

29:04.900 --> 29:06.900
1968 eight years

29:09.060 --> 29:15.420
Eight years after the thing they formed a nostalgia group, but it only oh here we go

29:15.420 --> 29:17.420
The only the only reason

29:17.420 --> 29:25.580
The only reason it worked is nostalgia was that there had been this profound cultural change in

29:26.020 --> 29:30.960
music and culture and so it truly was as though the fifties had been

29:31.300 --> 29:39.000
You know time warped out of existence five thousand years and they represented a completely different culture these guys up at Columbia

29:39.220 --> 29:45.460
University started singing these doo-wop songs from 15 years before or 10 years before and suddenly

29:45.460 --> 29:50.580
They're this oldies act and then they go to Woodstock and then they get a TV show out of it

29:50.780 --> 29:57.180
They're all really talented dudes, but none of them have they have that that completely it like

29:57.660 --> 30:04.580
Weird rock and roll pedigree, which is that they're all white guys from Massachusetts. No R&B behind them at all

30:04.940 --> 30:10.100
They're dancing and singing in gold lamé and their show is somewhere between you know

30:10.100 --> 30:14.940
The malt shop and studio 54. There's so much beard chest hair

30:15.060 --> 30:20.280
One of the cool guys is like 37 years old and bald it is insane

30:20.580 --> 30:27.780
It's a warm. It's like a warm blanket this description that you're just draping over me on a camping trip question

30:27.780 --> 30:33.100
They're just so many. I know now did you you shaved right? Okay, then I'll tell you the story of Shanana

30:33.300 --> 30:37.940
The questions that these they're talented and terrible at the same time

30:37.940 --> 30:41.820
They're dancing that it is the laziest choreography that I've ever seen

30:42.380 --> 30:49.260
Big Lenny who plays the saxophone who's from my home Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is still still alive and still out there blowing sax

30:49.380 --> 30:55.740
This guy's got a beautiful tenor voice, but should not be on TV not because he doesn't have a good look

30:55.740 --> 31:02.480
But he has no presence whatsoever on TV. He's constantly flapping his arms around while he sings like some obese bird

31:02.540 --> 31:05.260
it's insane like everything about it and

31:05.260 --> 31:07.500
And then they all quit

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
they all quit and became

31:11.020 --> 31:17.060
doctors and attorneys and professors one of them is a linguistics professor at Hofstra University and

31:17.740 --> 31:22.140
And and they're all they're all professionals now those who who are still with us

31:22.700 --> 31:26.260
Except for Bowser who's still out there selling the grease, right?

31:26.260 --> 31:37.580
And then and then Jaco Donnie and screaming Scott the nice thing about his starting in 68 with the 50s a culture for Bowser is that now

31:38.180 --> 31:42.760
If you are not aware of their history, he just looks like somebody who's aged really really well

31:42.900 --> 31:48.060
How is this guy still hanging with this this lifestyle because it was close enough to the 50s

31:48.060 --> 31:51.980
It seems like a really really old guy who looks fantastic

31:51.980 --> 31:53.980
I

31:54.300 --> 32:00.780
Pending the words by the pending. Oh, I know. Yeah, this is what this is. Well, I've been thinking about all night long you guys

32:02.820 --> 32:04.940
Everyone you know what you can all go down this hole together

32:05.140 --> 32:09.420
Let's go into the catching up on this John and you are very right about this gentleman

32:09.420 --> 32:12.680
I got distracted from the conversation and I just wanted to say that

32:13.260 --> 32:17.340
Bowser from shot on ah is a co-founder of a group called senior votes count

32:17.340 --> 32:20.140
Which is a political action committee for old people you guys

32:20.140 --> 32:25.540
I think the rest of this podcast should just be this the sound of us all just quietly click in the internet

32:27.380 --> 32:32.160
And then just speaking up when you find an interesting show my third of the program usually is

32:45.580 --> 32:46.780
I

32:46.780 --> 32:52.340
Want to talk to you guys about imperfect foods because I'm genuinely wild about it. Okay it you okay?

32:52.340 --> 32:55.380
So here's how it works. You know, I mean you have the the experience

32:56.020 --> 32:58.460
Every week that you hold on. Let me close my eyes

33:00.460 --> 33:03.460

The answer we got a between 20 and 25 B between 36 and 40 C between 60 and 71

38:57.280 --> 38:59.280
Are we just talking about the front row of teeth?

Face teeth or full body teeth. Are we full body teeth? Okay, 35 three

39:15.480 --> 39:17.480
The answer was B

39:18.240 --> 39:22.200
Between 36 and 40. Oh you're off by one next question. I got one more question

39:22.200 --> 39:28.280
This is the best game the left side of a horse the side of the horse that we mount is called or the broadside

39:28.880 --> 39:32.380
It's called the left flank the mount or or the near side the meatus

39:37.360 --> 39:39.360
Horses meatus

39:40.080 --> 39:42.080
I'm gonna go with the meatus

39:42.280 --> 39:45.440
Everyone's convinced. He's telling me it's the near side

39:46.400 --> 39:51.200
You can really get a you can get a full boot in that fleshy meatus. We got

39:51.200 --> 39:52.840
this a

39:52.840 --> 39:56.440
horse has long legs so it can a

39:57.120 --> 40:02.560
Run away from predators be jump out of the way of a predator chase dreams faster

40:03.080 --> 40:08.240
See stop a predator space see defend itself against the predator. Mm-hmm

40:08.360 --> 40:12.720
See keep dry when it floods so we can't D catch a prayer now

40:12.800 --> 40:15.600
So it can be tall enough to eat birds right out of the sky

40:15.600 --> 40:23.280
Yeah, he so it's a little bit closer to God. Mm-hmm. God's that's why God made his giraffe

40:23.920 --> 40:28.280
Said get up here horses. He said get on your horse. I'm gonna give you multiple choice question

40:28.280 --> 40:30.280
I'm not gonna give you multiple answers

40:30.280 --> 40:33.640
When a horse's ears are laid flat. What does that mean horny?

40:35.960 --> 40:39.800
Super suit. All right. This is lightning round Griffin. You said horny wrong Travis. I

40:39.800 --> 40:44.200
Made a bad investment incorrect Griffin

40:45.720 --> 40:47.720
Not horny

40:51.320 --> 40:56.000
If their ears are down they are explicitly not an ounce of horny

40:57.720 --> 41:04.600
Read the room Steve right by omission correct? They're angry or scared. So thank you read we're going to have food

41:04.600 --> 41:09.080
I'm keeping these like on my desk. Oh, yeah, so at any moment I can reach out and grab

41:09.080 --> 41:16.120
We also have just so you know for the future. We have care questions and breed question. Oh tight. I can't wait for the breed questions

41:18.120 --> 41:19.000
I

41:19.000 --> 41:23.980
Have a friend who absolutely hates the concept of laughing at bad movies

41:24.280 --> 41:29.980
For instance, he considers watching a movie like the room to be a massive waste of time when he could be watching something better

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
quote like transformers

41:32.600 --> 41:35.960
That's the whole of this dude

41:36.800 --> 41:38.000
You know

41:38.000 --> 41:40.480
My kids brothers and mr. Corbett

41:40.480 --> 41:47.160
How can we get this farcical flick Debbie downer in the right frame of mind or is this a lost cause?

41:47.160 --> 41:52.320
That's from bad movie buff in Brooklyn. Oh my god with the alliteration in your listeners

41:52.320 --> 41:55.000
We have a we have pretty savvy pretty savvy audience

41:55.040 --> 42:01.480
This actually this reminds me the first time Griffin and I watched the room with my now wife Teresa the look on her face

42:01.480 --> 42:04.320
was like a combination of like

42:04.920 --> 42:11.520
Confusion and frustration. She didn't know why she doesn't know why we did that to her. Yeah, she just kept saying what is this?

42:11.520 --> 42:15.640
Why are we no, I'm testing you darling. Yeah, and it was like get it and she's like no

42:15.640 --> 42:20.200
No, it's bad. She's bad. And then we made her watch it like eight more times and now she loves it. Oh

42:20.200 --> 42:29.200
Oh, yeah, but sort of Stockholm soon. Yeah, honey. He's from Stockholm. Ah,

42:32.200 --> 42:33.920
There is a

42:33.920 --> 42:39.200
There's there's there's a real problem with the premise of this question and the transformers method

42:39.200 --> 42:39.840
I mean

42:39.840 --> 42:45.360
I don't know where to go with that because if you don't enjoy the room and you do enjoy transformers

42:45.360 --> 42:51.520
I don't understand you as a human being it seems like to me like maybe his like through line like he doesn't like really good

42:51.520 --> 42:56.720
Movies or really bad movies and he just wants it right down the center there like milquetoast nothing

42:56.760 --> 43:04.640
He likes the movie protagonist of 1950s version of movies. Sure. Yeah, and he wants to be beat up by Michael Bay

43:06.600 --> 43:10.560
Well, I mean I I guess there's why would you try to force someone to do that

43:10.560 --> 43:16.880
I guess to marry them if Travis is to be believed, but that's the only reason as a weird doubter

43:16.880 --> 43:19.440
I forget what the actual question was

43:22.360 --> 43:26.640
Really break it down to like really parse it is how do you get someone to like bad movies?

43:26.640 --> 43:32.880
And I don't I think it's a little questionable as a premise. I mean, yeah, you're not supposed to right?

43:32.880 --> 43:33.600
I mean well

43:33.600 --> 43:37.160
but here's the thing is because I was thinking about this on the way over when I got stuck in traffic is

43:37.560 --> 43:39.560
the idea of I

43:39.560 --> 43:43.800
Didn't start liking bad movies. I started as a kid watching MST 3k with dad

43:43.840 --> 43:50.840
Sure, and then through that like transitioning into liking bad movies, and I think that it's an acquired taste, you know

43:50.840 --> 43:55.520
It's a thing that's like you can't show someone who's only seen like current blockbuster

43:55.800 --> 44:01.920
Quote good or bad movies and then expect them to like the room and Manos hands of fate and get it

44:01.920 --> 44:06.720
Like you kind of got a like clue them in with we're going to watch something that frames it

44:06.720 --> 44:12.040
Like isn't this fun to make fun of I think I think you are really on to something and it it

44:12.480 --> 44:14.880
You know when I when I was working on the show

44:14.880 --> 44:18.960
My parents would watch and they could not they just couldn't get past the movies

44:18.960 --> 44:25.200
They were just go like man that movie was really bad. You know, there's just a terrible movie. I couldn't watch anymore

44:28.720 --> 44:34.720
Take you through it a little bit mom and dad but yeah, and I don't I would never force that on people unless I wanted

44:34.720 --> 44:37.380
To bury them. Uh-huh. Do you do you do you feel like you guys?

44:38.000 --> 44:43.860
Like provided a really valuable service to the movie industry the filmmaking industry where?

44:44.480 --> 44:48.160
If a movie studio, I feel like made a really terrible movie

44:48.800 --> 44:52.800
Before you guys came around. It was just a total loss. It was it was a disaster for them

44:52.800 --> 44:54.800
But now if somebody makes a really bad movie, it's like well

44:55.200 --> 44:58.920
At least somebody's gonna get some sort of like twisted pleasure

44:58.920 --> 45:04.880
I like like there is a there has been cultivated among people and appreciation for bad movies. That wasn't there before

45:05.480 --> 45:09.640
So at least we've got that at least we'll bring some modicum of joy to people

45:09.640 --> 45:14.260
Especially now with podcasts and like YouTube and it's like everybody talks about bad movies

45:14.260 --> 45:18.640
Yeah in a way that like people weren't doing you know in the 90s and a so for example

45:18.640 --> 45:22.340
I was a teenage strangler was filmed in our hometown Huntington West Virginia

45:22.340 --> 45:26.200
So when it was on MSD 3k, it was like this huge thing like it's back

45:26.200 --> 45:31.080
We've done it and and it also puts the lie to your old teachers thing about nobody ever making it

45:31.400 --> 45:35.080
Take that mrs. Williams. Well, no because we're all getting strangled

45:36.600 --> 45:43.120
By by by a fellow native though, right? There you go. Yeah, so I so it's our town in the best light

45:43.120 --> 45:45.440
Just we're calling the herd. We're building a

45:46.400 --> 45:50.600
Staircase of human bodies for here you go. Well, I you know, I don't know

45:50.600 --> 45:53.960
I we've wanted Hollywood to appreciate that service

45:53.960 --> 45:59.080
We provide them for years, but but so far so far nothing. No, no fungible

45:59.400 --> 46:04.580
You know, we're just not big enough problems you affect their sales and that's all they care about and when we have actually

46:05.680 --> 46:11.400
Negotiated them via riff tracks for bigger titles. It is all it's like diffusing a bomb

46:11.400 --> 46:13.400
They're very sensitive about it and we eventually

46:14.000 --> 46:20.560
Shook a few, you know 90s to early 2000 titles away from them with money just with Kickstarter money

46:20.560 --> 46:26.560
But they're just very concerned about the the relations the trail of relationships. They have in general

46:26.560 --> 46:30.160
I'm imagining that conversation like you want to make fun of

46:31.240 --> 46:33.240
Casablanca

46:34.280 --> 46:37.480
No, you can't you can't come on they're all dead come on

46:37.680 --> 46:38.720
Yeah, you're right

46:38.720 --> 46:46.120
My girlfriend and I live about 1500 miles apart and one of our favorite pastimes is watching MST 3k and riff tracks together over skype

46:46.120 --> 46:51.360
Which MST 3k episode of riff tracks VOD would you recommend for a young couple in love?

46:52.400 --> 47:00.200
Amorous in Austin, I don't you know, I guess it if he's asking me if you something that would enhance their love or sexual pleasure

47:01.360 --> 47:07.960
I'm a little scared of that question. Frankly. What's the most erotic MST 3k episode the Apple?

47:09.360 --> 47:12.920
The Roger Daltrey looking guy running around in a loincloth

47:12.920 --> 47:20.240
It doesn't get can you just repeat the chapter with the sex song in it the song that takes place in the sex

47:20.240 --> 47:25.160
I was I was drunk at that point of the movie the the time that I watched it

47:25.160 --> 47:30.440
But I do distinctly remember there being a sex song that somebody's saying while having sex

47:30.440 --> 47:35.220
Which I guess one of your brothers can sing it sex song from the Apple. Oh, man, it's gonna be bad

47:35.720 --> 47:39.920
I'm gonna it's a double entendre. I believe it is a

47:39.920 --> 47:45.240
single entendre. It's 1.2 entendres. I'm coming

47:48.680 --> 47:50.860
Is memory foam bad for sex

47:53.720 --> 48:00.160
Thinking of getting either a memory foam mattress or a topper update also, I mean good sex not boring sex

48:01.440 --> 48:02.960
insight oh

48:02.960 --> 48:06.360
Well, I'm quite clarified because memory foam is great for boring sex

48:06.360 --> 48:13.920
I mean, I don't want to show my hand but I make love like I'm slowly being absorbed by quicksand

48:14.160 --> 48:17.720
Mm-hmm. I don't want I don't want here's their problem

48:18.680 --> 48:24.920
You can use a memory foam mattress. It'll make sex sex better, but only if you get a memory foam

48:25.440 --> 48:27.880
Mattress after you've been having sex for a while

48:28.240 --> 48:34.440
Because if you have sex for the first few times on a memory foam mattress and then later you're still having sex on it

48:34.440 --> 48:37.120
You're gonna look at those in previous indentations

48:38.080 --> 48:39.840
What was I doing?

48:39.840 --> 48:44.760
Memory foam remembers don't remember that what's with all the elbow imprints?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.160
What was I doing?

48:47.160 --> 48:50.600
the weird thing is when you plug your memory foam into your computer and you

48:51.120 --> 48:55.360
Download all of the information and it gives you all the stats off of your previous lovemaking sessions

48:56.040 --> 48:59.800
Yeah, it's me clippy good number of pumps there trout

48:59.800 --> 49:08.680
I'm gonna keep track of your pumps. Hey clipping. I'll track your pumps for you travel. Hey, have you tried minecraft?

49:12.160 --> 49:14.360
See you added a swerve trap

49:18.200 --> 49:23.920
Trap we can virus alerts. Hey sure you need to compensate for the angle trap

49:23.920 --> 49:27.480
You know what I'm talking about need to run a McCaffrey virus check buddy

49:27.480 --> 49:31.120
I can't help but notice not cuddling afterwards you jackass

49:32.720 --> 49:37.760
What have you read it his erect penis had a red squiggly line underneath it

49:41.120 --> 49:43.120
Boy you spelled

49:47.840 --> 49:49.840
I

49:49.840 --> 49:51.080
Mean I

49:51.080 --> 49:55.280
None of us own a memory foam, right? I didn't I know what that we're making a lot

49:55.280 --> 49:59.600
I know we're making a lot of money on this show, but not that minecraft money. No

50:00.840 --> 50:08.280
It seems to me though, like it wouldn't be ideal unless for some reason while you fuck

50:08.800 --> 50:14.080
You like to have glasses of wine all around you that you don't want to spill over onto yourself

50:14.080 --> 50:16.960
it seems it's so funny to me because it seems like

50:17.720 --> 50:23.200
40 years ago. The thing was like it was like water, you know water mattresses

50:23.200 --> 50:30.240
yeah, what are those called water beds water beds, which is like the polar opposite of memory foam memory foam is like

50:30.240 --> 50:31.520
Oh, you can like bounce a bowling ball

50:31.520 --> 50:36.280
Nothing happens and like a water but it's like oh you moved your elbow and you flipped the other person out of the bed

50:36.440 --> 50:42.580
Yeah, oh, well, I think that the I think that making love when you make love in a memory foam

50:44.020 --> 50:51.160
You are nullifying a lot of the earth's natural physics and effects and a lot of the

50:51.160 --> 50:53.160
simple machines

50:54.080 --> 51:00.800
Featured in a traditional mattress and I think that I think I I mean, I love extreme restraints

51:01.720 --> 51:07.320
But I I get by with those simple machines, you know, I mean springs levers screws

51:08.000 --> 51:15.480
Thank you in crime in client planes things like that and in a memory foam you are floating in the negative zone

51:16.100 --> 51:20.240
You know what? I mean, you're in print you are imprisoned in the negative zone and I don't think Zod

51:20.240 --> 51:25.320
I love making love and that can be pleasurable kneel before Zod

51:28.160 --> 51:30.280
But I don't think it works for everyone

51:31.440 --> 51:37.940
But isn't that true of all lovemaking Griffin, maybe one man's memory foam is another man's sleep number bed

51:37.940 --> 51:49.540
And I sleep another man's inflatable camping mattress sleep number bed would be great because I have always wanted a fuck number

51:50.100 --> 51:56.580
That's something they do not feature in the advertisements, but you say what's your sleep number 28, what's your fuck number?

51:57.540 --> 51:58.740
35

51:58.740 --> 52:04.980
Yeah, and then someone's like is that the number of people you've slept with and it's like no that number is zero. I

52:04.980 --> 52:10.900
Just know my I know my fuck number in preparation for that special they find that for you in the store

52:10.900 --> 52:12.900
That number is zero and looking

52:14.260 --> 52:18.500
Ladies zero plus and then you say why is it zero and he says

52:18.900 --> 52:22.100
True love waits and it was a commercial for true love waits the whole time

52:22.820 --> 52:25.460
Okay, guys, marry fuck kill. Are you ready?

52:26.420 --> 52:30.260
Sleep number. Yeah, memory foam. Yeah, graphmatic adjustable

52:30.260 --> 52:33.700
Memory foam. Yeah graphmatic adjustable. Oh my god

52:35.060 --> 52:39.700
I didn't kill the graphmatic just because it would kill you I think to try and

52:40.740 --> 52:41.860
um

52:41.860 --> 52:45.240
Make that two back piece up on that you get fold up like a panini

52:46.660 --> 52:48.660
Um the sexiest panini

52:51.380 --> 52:53.780
Uh, is it weird to buy toilet paper in bulk?

52:53.780 --> 52:59.940
My husband refuses to buy or be seen with me when I buy toilet paper because I prefer to buy a 24 pack instead of

52:59.940 --> 53:06.420
A four or six pack because it's cheaper and something will always I assume need you assume

53:07.220 --> 53:08.740
I assume

53:08.740 --> 53:11.220
Okay, roger. My butthole is just gone

53:12.180 --> 53:14.180
Sweet, you know, we don't need

53:14.260 --> 53:17.140
Roger leaves got really soft all of a sudden

53:17.860 --> 53:21.380
My husband is very embarrassed by my large toilet paper purchases

53:21.380 --> 53:25.380
And believes other people will judge us and find us weird for the large purchase

53:25.940 --> 53:27.380
Is it a legitimate concern?

53:27.380 --> 53:29.780
Is it worth sacrificing the extra dollars and time?

53:29.860 --> 53:37.540
I'll spend shopping more regularly for tp to avoid having other people think I must poop a lot. That's from cabinets

53:38.180 --> 53:40.500
full of toilet paper in term

53:40.980 --> 53:47.220
I when I see that at the grocery store and don't get it twisted when you buy a 24 pack of charmon

53:47.220 --> 53:54.820
At the grocery store, that's all that's going in your cart. That's problem. Number one. Yeah, but when I see that when I'm exposed to that

53:55.620 --> 54:00.020
I just think like you've got a lot of shitting

54:00.900 --> 54:02.900
to do

54:03.540 --> 54:05.140
I assume

54:05.140 --> 54:06.260
Hold on

54:06.260 --> 54:12.340
But what's the what's the worried implication that someone sees you pick up a 24 pack of toilet paper like, oh lose butthole

54:12.500 --> 54:16.020
Like what's the you know when you buy i'm saying that there should be a stigma

54:16.020 --> 54:19.300
And i'm saying like when you go to the when you go to a fucking

54:19.520 --> 54:25.720
Walgreens and you pick up a pack of rubbers or jimmy hats or whatever the fuck we call them now jazz raincoats

54:26.100 --> 54:27.460
we

54:27.460 --> 54:31.780
Some jazz raincoats or you buy them. You don't put them on in the store

54:31.940 --> 54:37.140
Although they should let you do that because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing no matter how much they fucking tell you

54:37.700 --> 54:40.740
It's not a one-size-fits-all and the crazy thing is once you get them home and open them

54:40.820 --> 54:43.220
They don't let you return them. They don't let you return them

54:43.220 --> 54:48.900
Um, especially once after you've used them you have to google condom sizes like some sort of caveman

54:49.060 --> 54:55.720
But anyway, when you kind of google caveman you go to cvs you say let me get they're all in centimeters you go to cvs

54:57.700 --> 54:59.860
And you say let me get a pack of

55:00.660 --> 55:04.180
Smokes and they say we don't sell those anymore and you say fuck

55:04.580 --> 55:08.820
Let me get some jimmy hats instead then and you feel embarrassed about the jimmy hats

55:08.820 --> 55:13.300
because they know that your dick's going in that and they know that you're you're

55:13.540 --> 55:17.780
You're detritus is probably going in that too and that's gross and you're embarrassed

55:17.940 --> 55:23.060
But you buy toilet paper like oh you're doing some pooping. Yeah, cool. Cool. Cool, and it's not a thing

55:23.380 --> 55:26.040
I think that you should apply the same level of discretion

55:26.820 --> 55:28.820
to tp that you do

55:29.460 --> 55:32.900
to to to condoms and diaphragms and and and

55:32.900 --> 55:40.740
And new verax. I feel like i've mentioned this before but I I can't help but apply narrative

55:41.380 --> 55:45.940
When i'm buying toilet paper, I always feel like the implication is whatever i'm buying

55:46.500 --> 55:51.060
With that toilet paper is going to make me poop. I feel like if i'm buying like

55:52.260 --> 55:55.940
If i'm buying like a heath bar and some toilet paper, I think the short story

55:55.940 --> 56:02.980
A big day plant. I need this heath bar and it's gonna give me diarrhea. So I need the toilet paper for that

56:03.220 --> 56:07.140
That's right. You put the heath bar on the counter and then you put the toilet paper just in case

56:09.220 --> 56:15.000
What if we look at this as a business opportunity and i'm always looking at things like business opportunities

56:15.620 --> 56:16.660
um

56:16.660 --> 56:21.140
If we open up our own toilet paper manufacturer and distribution company

56:21.140 --> 56:25.860
And it comes in an unmarked box and no, no you sell it at grocery stores

56:26.100 --> 56:31.300
But it's just a single you just buy one roll of toilet paper at a time and the name of the company is

56:31.540 --> 56:33.540
Carpe Diem toilet paper company

56:35.620 --> 56:37.620
That person is living for today

56:37.700 --> 56:41.060
That's great because you grab that one roll and you go to the counter and kind of like wiggle a little bit and do a

56:41.060 --> 56:43.300
Little dance like okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on

56:43.300 --> 56:46.260
All right, come on come on come on

56:47.860 --> 56:53.860
I I as much as I I I mean there's another way of looking at this which is if you buy a huge

56:54.660 --> 56:56.420
bulk of toilet paper

56:56.420 --> 57:02.340
That's rarer that people are going to spot you buying toilet paper if you go at like two in the morning

57:02.900 --> 57:05.140
To the walmart to buy your toilet paper

57:05.620 --> 57:09.860
Then you know, you can never be spotted. It could be a stealth mission you do that once a month or something

57:09.860 --> 57:16.180
Mm-hmm. Oh or go every day and buy a 24 pack every day and look the guy square in the eye every time i'm back

57:16.500 --> 57:21.140
I'm back. There is can I i'm basically like a basically like a sandworm essentially i'm just

57:21.780 --> 57:25.220
I I consume and process and expunge

57:25.940 --> 57:30.020
I'm also not good at conserving toilet paper. No, how many pieces sorry, I gotta go

57:30.980 --> 57:37.060
uh, nobody likes buying a huge thing of toilet paper, but there is I think we can all admit a

57:37.060 --> 57:42.500
A special kind of feeling of security and luxury. Oh, yeah when you peel

57:43.060 --> 57:50.260
Of single roll off of a 24 pack at home and you think oh man. I have got a lot of toilet

57:51.060 --> 57:57.060
Whatever whenever I that happens I have the feeling like i'll never have to buy toilet paper. Oh, yeah. Yeah

57:57.300 --> 58:00.660
You buy a 24 pack. You're like, well, that's toilet paper sorted for life

58:01.300 --> 58:02.660
What next?

58:02.660 --> 58:08.100
Give me that giant container of oats. Okay, let's take my idea and flip it on the inverse and we start a company called

58:08.180 --> 58:13.540
For life toilet paper and you buy it it costs. How much would you how much would you pay?

58:14.020 --> 58:17.620
How high is this ceiling? I would I would pay thirteen thousand

58:18.560 --> 58:25.620
Thirteen thousand dollars for a four thousand eight hundred and twelve pack. Are you ready for this? You call it call of nature box. Okay

58:27.780 --> 58:31.140
Every two weeks someone comes to your door and just hands you

58:31.140 --> 58:36.980
I don't want I don't want a shit paper interaction every 14 goddamn days. I want to knock it out

58:36.980 --> 58:41.300
Once i'm going to save up my money and put in a down payment investment in myself

58:42.100 --> 58:46.980
Why are we this is our bedroom and this is our living room and this is our toilet paper room

58:47.620 --> 58:52.100
Why are we shipping things to people that I would like healthy snacks that I would be proud to buy

58:52.580 --> 58:58.580
I would be proud to stride into the store. Why are we not secretly shipping people toilet paper? It doesn't make sense to me

58:58.580 --> 59:04.420
It's sickening. It's because it doesn't have that stigma and we need to we need to make people ashamed of their bowel movements

59:05.540 --> 59:10.900
Everybody just should be more ashamed of their bodies in general. Yeah. Oh god, especially the evil that comes out of it

59:13.540 --> 59:14.820
Um

59:14.820 --> 59:18.740
Let's try this yahoo auto sin and by rachel sperling game recognized game. Thank you. Rachel

59:18.740 --> 59:24.020
It's by yahoo answers user vicky who asks could someone pretty please write a vampire story, please

Okay, okay

59:32.500 --> 59:39.940

59:39.940 --> 59:44.740
By a vampire named josea. I want eye contact hypnosis, please

59:45.460 --> 59:47.460
Okay, first of all, that's called thrall

59:47.700 --> 59:49.700
It's not called hypnosis

59:49.700 --> 59:52.180
You're in the thrall jeez amateurs

59:52.180 --> 59:54.180
Amateurs

59:54.660 --> 59:56.660
Glamour is what I prefer

59:56.740 --> 01:00:03.060
Glamour is something that masks you so it's more like uh, you would cast a glamour on someone to so they would ignore you

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.660
No, yeah, but in true blood they call it glamoring they verb it

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.820
I go he glamored me into doing this

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.700
I think that means you dress them up in sequence and and you made them more glamour that's dazzle them

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.660
What a fucking stupid show that sounds like

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.220

Vamp fiction. So is the question asker asking someone to write them a story

And it's just like hey i'm gonna tell you what I want in the story

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.620

Bought it for me for my birthday where I went to like planet travis and they can I machine that worked on wishes?

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.060

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.220
Right, I wish I wish

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:08.260

What do you think this person wants the story for

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.820
Do you think it's an assignment where they have to write it and they're going at least i've got all the bones of it

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.400
But I just can't put the meat on it. Yeah from from their their teacher miss clitoris

Okay, so let's go through it. She's in a dark forest at night

Okay, how much time do we have left in the show? Uh enough time to write some erotic vampire. Okay, let's let's let's

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.940
Let's write one. I'm the oldest

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.660
I'll start. Okay, and

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.860
Oh like an exquisite corpse

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.380
Yeah, uh, maybe not once okay. Yeah, we'll do one sentence at a time. That'd be good. Okay

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:11.700
Okay, the night was dark and also horny the the forest was as dark as it was horny, too

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.540
I'm my name is elena and this forest got me feeling real horny down there

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.580
I swired a shape

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.580
In the darkness that was white but had eyes and a cape

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.140
And maybe fangs. It was definitely glamorous, but also erotic

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.860
His name was josea. He didn't

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.300
Tell me that but he looked like one

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.660
He looked like my friend josea. It's there's more than once there was a semicolon in there

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.980
He looked like my friend josea from work at dress barn

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.180
I got closer to him. I saw that underneath the cape

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.980
He was wearing some sensible jeans and no shirt

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:59.540
But he just had like a cape and his muscles were like, yes, and I didn't know much but he was definitely bonered

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.060
Dude

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.340
I could see it through his jeans. I could see the boner through his jeans

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.680
Another semicolon was in there. They were as sensible as they were see-through

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.700
Uh, it's not your turn. Oh, sorry

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.180
I looked dude's eyes

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:17.620
They remind me

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:22.420
Of josea my friend at dress barn and that's that's that's when it occurred to me

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500
I'm gonna bone this dude. No

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:31.620
I feel good. I don't know where these thoughts are coming from. They definitely weren't my own

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.860
No, you said that's what occurred to me that I was gonna phone this dude

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.580
Well, and also I hate to take umbridge, but and then it occurred to me is not a complete sentence

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.740
I there was a high fit. There was ellipses at the end

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.940
um chapter two

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.500
I got fired from just barn today

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.780
I got fired by my manager josea. I thought he was my friend

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.900
Also, he has amazing muscles and he doesn't wear a shirt and he wears a cape

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.500
But a different cape this is we're talking about a different josea here. I can't express this enough. I wish

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:20.260
I wish I really try to get a hook into this story travis. You were just not letting me try

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.480
I wish everything in my house smelled like dress barn josea

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:30.120
Suddenly there was a clattering at my window. It was santa claus

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.700
He I fucked my brain and the sexy stuff

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.900
Turns out it was a was a drakul all along

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.460
santa climbed in my window and he opened up his sack and he

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:50.100
And he let it fall to the ground and inside there was just one gift

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:54.580
And it was josea the vampire from earlier and not the dress barn josea

01:04:55.220 --> 01:05:02.500
He looked deep into my eyeballs and I got totally totally bonered for him. And then santa claus was like well

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.660
I guess I should get going

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:10.740
Seems like things are about to get a little bit lusty in here

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.220
I've got other sex draculas to drop off a kid's houses like you

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:22.820
And then josea spun around and he drank santa's blood I don't know until he died

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.260
And let me be honest. It was a huge turn on

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.980
So I reached inside of his

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.300
sack and I got out

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.780
hundreds of sex draculas

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.940
all for me

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.940
Um

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.580
I'm not done. I'm not done

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.820
I crowd surfed

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:57.700
On the sex draculas like buckethead at a corn show when buckethead was stealing corn

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.580
Was he ever tamed?

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:07.860
Did he did he glamour him? Yeah. Yeah. I said the thing about the eye fucking. Okay. I think we just covered all our bases there

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.820
Also, wait, hold on

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.900
Oh, hold on. Somebody's at my door. Give me a second

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:29.300
