00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.760
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.760 --> 00:54.080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Justin

00:54.080 --> 00:59.120
McElroy. I'm Travis. Did you guys hear that? I actually didn't. Did you guys hear that?

00:59.120 --> 01:02.400
I didn't mean to sigh. Okay, it threw me off so bad I said your name.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.240
Are you okay? I'm fine. Okay, I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother. Do you have a show in

01:12.240 --> 01:21.440
you today, Justin? Are you cool? There is gonna be a show. You have an show inside of you that's

01:21.440 --> 01:30.880
waiting. Do you know what's strange? I didn't know how I felt. This show is my therapy. This is my

01:30.880 --> 01:37.360
time to unpack everything, and I went into this recording not knowing how I felt today, and then

01:37.360 --> 01:46.320
when I was trying to put on, as we say in French, le masque, the show. The masque of the host,

01:46.320 --> 01:54.880
the entertainer, the funny man, whisk us away, Pagliacci. I've discovered a sort of unease.

01:56.240 --> 02:01.440
You reached in to the depths to pull out the comedy that is at the base of the sorrow in

02:01.440 --> 02:05.120
your soul, but you found only sorrow. There's just sorrow in there, yeah.

02:05.120 --> 02:13.200
What I found is if I dig deep enough, the comedy's in there. Maybe that's what I was trying to get

02:13.200 --> 02:25.600
out was sort of in the parlance of Aristotle, the expurgation of pity and fear, the great art.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.000
So this is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show. So what this means is the people

02:32.000 --> 02:37.680
you have heard in the past couple of minutes are going to tell you what to do in a fun twist.

02:37.680 --> 02:44.160
Yeah. Now I want to start off, and this is not normally how we do it, and I'm going to admit

02:44.160 --> 02:51.760
this is a special occasion, but to start off the episode, we got an email from Rose, and it was

02:51.760 --> 02:57.200
about a topic that we discussed last episode or a couple episodes ago, and it goes like this.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.440
And Rose, I want to say thank you for the powerful start to this question. There was no lead-in. It

03:03.440 --> 03:10.320
just started like this. How I heard it is that Ray Bradbury actually asked his local fire department

03:10.320 --> 03:15.840
what temperature books burned at, and they went and lit a book on fire and measured the temperature

03:15.840 --> 03:20.400
while they were still on the phone with him and reported back that the temperature was Fahrenheit

03:20.400 --> 03:26.960
451. No idea if that's true or not. Rose. I wish I could have been there when they were like,

03:26.960 --> 03:35.440
Bradbury wants us to burn a book, and they're like, which book? We got to pick a book to burn.

03:36.160 --> 03:42.640
Well, let's see. It's a fire station, so what we have here is the phone book and a book about how

03:42.640 --> 03:50.720
to fight fires and the Bible. Hey, Jimmy, weren't you reading Nadine Kootz earlier?

03:50.720 --> 03:54.720
Yeah, but I haven't finished it. It's Ray Bradbury, dude. All right.

03:54.720 --> 04:01.680
On the phone. Scorch that, Koontz. You burned my Koontz.

04:01.680 --> 04:07.600
Is it among the services that the fire department offers that if you call them,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.880
you can ask any object and they will burn it for you?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.120
Yes. Also, hey, also,

04:13.840 --> 04:20.560
why does the fire department even possess the implements? The one place you don't want there

04:20.560 --> 04:27.360
to be a fire is in the fire station, because that's where you have all your shit for fighting

04:27.360 --> 04:30.800
it, right? Why do they even have the implements for starting a fire?

04:31.840 --> 04:36.000
Well, to train, Justin, obviously, because you don't want the first time you fight a fire to

04:36.000 --> 04:43.600
be live out in the real world. There's not a training fire, it's fire.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.360
But you put a fire, a control fire, you put a fire in the waste paper basket,

04:47.360 --> 04:51.040
so first aid John can put it out and feel like a powerful firefighter.

04:51.920 --> 04:59.920
Hey, I want all our rangers, all our park service people to get at me on this one.

04:59.920 --> 05:06.640
Reminder, my Twitter handle is at a plus K. A control burn is a fucking lie.

05:06.640 --> 05:11.200
If anybody says that there's a control burn, they're lying to you. It's fire, baby.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.480
Justin. It's going to do,

05:13.200 --> 05:15.680
it's a thing. I'm not saying that a fire

05:15.680 --> 05:21.280
lit in a waste paper basket is a control burn. No, I'm saying the idea of control burns,

05:21.280 --> 05:28.560
and please get at me, people who do manage forests for a living, A plus K.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.800
It's not a control burn, baby. It's a fire. It's going to do what it's going to do.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.440
That has got to be the worst moment of your day if you're like,

05:39.440 --> 05:42.560
it's a controlled burn, and then you notice that one tree.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.720
A little tinder. Oh no, that was one of the good trees.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.560
Then you got to start like, oh yeah, I did want to get that one too.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.080
I can just run over there with a can of spray paint, just put an X on that one real quick.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.720
It's all part of the plan. Yeah, it's all under control.

06:01.680 --> 06:08.320
Somebody needs to write a sci-fi novel called Control Burn, but it's C-T-R-L Burn.

06:08.320 --> 06:13.360
Ooh, Travis. Ooh, that's good. Yeah, think about that.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.480
Anyways, I like that we could call the fire department and just be like,

06:16.480 --> 06:19.520
hey, at what temperature does a classic Teddy Ruxpin burn?

06:20.240 --> 06:25.040
And they would have to do it, or else I guess I don't pay their salaries anymore.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.160
Do you know what's fucked up? It's 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.480
Oh no. Such a dangerous little toy.

06:31.760 --> 06:37.120
I mean, that tape deck in there, it's its own internal combustion engine. It's not great.

06:37.120 --> 06:43.760
So they have tools to measure how hot a fire is at the fire department, and I believe that.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.360
But then I also wonder, does that mean they're going to measure the heat of a fire when they

06:47.360 --> 06:49.520
get to a house fire? And they're like, that's too hot.

06:49.520 --> 06:54.960
Or that they roll up to a house fire, point their thermometer at it, and they're like,

06:54.960 --> 06:59.680
it's okay, guys. It's a cold fire. It's only 200 degrees in there.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.280
Fuck it, we don't need our suits. This is a baby fire.

07:03.280 --> 07:08.080
I've got a thick sweater on. This is a cold ass fire. In and out, no problem.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.520
Can we do a question that's not about Ray Bradbury?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.200
I want to talk more about Ray Bradbury.

07:13.840 --> 07:18.160
No, it's fine. I'll do one. We'll do one for them, one for us.

07:18.160 --> 07:18.400
Okay.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.640
I heard that he called a tattoo parlor and said,

07:20.640 --> 07:22.640
how many tattoos could you put on a man?

07:22.640 --> 07:23.680
Before he's illustrated.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.720
Before he's illustrated.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.520
I was on the way out the door to walk our dog, Cooper, nice.

07:30.160 --> 07:30.400
Wow.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.200
Wow. When I realized I was without a plastic bag-

07:33.200 --> 07:36.160
Hold on real quick. Did you say that because you're assuming that this person

07:36.160 --> 07:37.920
named their dog after your second daughter?

07:38.640 --> 07:41.120
Well, they didn't name them. I'm assuming they named them after,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.640
but maybe they named them before, in which case-

07:44.640 --> 07:45.200
You took a dog.

07:45.200 --> 07:45.760
Okay, fine.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.640
Yeah. And now you've named your daughter after their dog.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.120
Well, I named a dog Indiana.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.160
Classic. Love him.

07:54.160 --> 07:54.800
Classic.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.200
I love him.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.240
Love Iron Man.

07:56.240 --> 08:01.600
...the movies. When I realized I was without a plastic bag for his poop,

08:01.600 --> 08:04.400
my wife ran to our kitchen for me and pulled one from the recycling

08:04.400 --> 08:05.920
before sending me on my way.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.520
I'm now blocks from the house. He's pooping.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.160
I realized she handed me a dramatically oversized baggie,

08:10.160 --> 08:13.120
the ones from Goodwill that fit coats and bedding and stuff.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.520
It seems wasteful to use such an enormous amount of plastic for a single duty.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.560
What do I do?

08:18.560 --> 08:23.280
Do I pick up after him in this ludicrously big bag or do I search for a plan B?

08:23.280 --> 08:26.720
That's from superfluously sized shit bag in Greensboro.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.160
I mean, think about your poor dog who sees the size of the duty bag

08:30.160 --> 08:32.880
and is like, damn, Jeremy, are you sure?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.880
I'll do my best, but fuck, bud.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.920
I'm gonna disappoint you, buddy. I'm so sorry.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.880
I don't know what you have planned for the day, but is that for both of us?

08:45.120 --> 08:46.480
Yeah, I mean, oh God.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.080
I mean, it's important that you clean up the duty.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.040
That's just, that's one on one. Leaving the duty there is-

08:51.040 --> 08:53.840
I mean, it is.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.640
No, listen, I'm a dog owner. I pick up my dog's shit.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.280
You want a fucking trophy?

08:59.280 --> 09:03.360
I also think that it is interesting that we have a society of like,

09:03.360 --> 09:08.960
all other animals shit outside and there's dirt there and mud and stuff.

09:08.960 --> 09:14.640
But my dog shit, I have to, with a like microscopically thin bag,

09:14.640 --> 09:20.160
put it in my hand while you watch to make sure I do it, Mr. Jones next door.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.240
This is a weird character trap.

09:24.640 --> 09:29.280
I've never stepped in like squirrel shit and had it ruin my day.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.880
Let me actually check my history.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.360
Yep, it's always dogs that I step in.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.880
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.520
I'm saying I don't like doing it.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.960
Yeah, okay. Nobody likes it.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.440
Nobody's like, all right, little brown treasure.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.760
Neither of you are dog owners.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.360
So let me tell you the most awkward thing in being a dog owner

09:54.080 --> 09:56.320
is after you've picked up your dog's shit

09:56.320 --> 09:58.560
and you're carrying it around in an old Kroger bag

09:59.280 --> 10:01.360
and like you're walking back home

10:01.360 --> 10:05.040
and like another car from your neighborhood drives by

10:05.040 --> 10:08.800
and you kind of awkwardly wave with the hand holding the bag of shit.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.480
Yeah, now imagine this, but it's a mattress bag.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.520
It's a big fucking steamer trunk size.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.400
It's a big boy.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.360
I mean, you have to do it.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.920
Can you pick up a bunch of different stuff?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.720
Yeah, there's gotta be some other poop lying around.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.920
Not even, it doesn't even have to be poop.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.680
You find a cool pine cone or glitter.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.320
Yeah, I mean, you know, non-bioorganic litter.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.000
Oh, I thought you said glitter.

10:38.000 --> 10:38.800
No, litter.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.280
Because if you do just have the one poop in this huge, huge bag,

10:41.280 --> 10:46.880
you're gonna look like some sort of like off-brand Johnny Appleseed dude.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.240
This is my last one.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.520
Nearing the end of his journey.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.120
Could you keep reusing the bag until it's full?

10:54.720 --> 10:55.920
Where are you gonna store that, Trapp?

10:56.720 --> 10:57.600
Between uses.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.920
Right inside the door so it's there next time you need it.

11:00.560 --> 11:05.840
We're gonna need a mud room for this, specifically for the bag.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.480
Justin, it sounds like you're not having fun.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.240
I take trash bags really seriously.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.440
And I'm gonna think about how I'm out of my big trash bags that I treasure.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.800
Sometimes, you know what I do sometimes?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.280
What do you do?

11:15.280 --> 11:17.920
This is embarrassing, but like I'll get,

11:17.920 --> 11:20.880
you know, I like the big, big ass contractor trash.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.600
Yeah, baby.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.400
Yeah, yeah.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.120
You know, baby.

11:23.120 --> 11:26.320
The ones that make me feel like I could throw anything away.

11:26.320 --> 11:26.800
Don't even.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.120
Yeah, you could throw like hunks of concrete in there.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.320
It'll stretch around it.

11:31.120 --> 11:36.400
Sometimes I get a mind to do some cleaning and figure out like,

11:36.400 --> 11:39.680
oh man, I've only filled up half of this amazing trash bag.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.480
Yeah.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.120
And so I'll just leave the trash bag.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.720
You guys ever do this?

11:44.720 --> 11:47.200
Just leave the trash bag centrally located.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.040
And then if somebody tries to throw trash in the regular trash can,

11:51.040 --> 11:55.280
I'm like, hold on, I got this big one over here.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.680
Don't fill up the smaller cans with that trash.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.520
Come put it in this big boy I got.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.760
This is my big centrally located trash.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.040
I'm trying to fill her up.

12:05.040 --> 12:10.640
Justin, you have just maybe described like the clearest example

12:10.640 --> 12:15.360
of dad idiosyncrasy since we started making this show.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.480
Like that is such like a-

12:16.480 --> 12:19.520
Do you mean Clint and the evil McElroy or dad in general?

12:19.520 --> 12:24.160
Like you are a dad because you do this thing I've never heard of before.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.280
Don't you guys get me-

12:27.280 --> 12:28.800
Okay, okay, okay.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.360
When people in your household, and I know that, I mean-

12:33.360 --> 12:35.680
The kids today.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.280
When people in your household throw away trash

12:39.280 --> 12:41.440
that takes up half of the trash can,

12:42.080 --> 12:44.320
does that not drive you fucking batshit?

12:44.320 --> 12:45.760
Let me ask you a follow up question.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.640
Did they use my special big garbage bag?

12:55.040 --> 12:57.200
The one that I saved just for big boy Josh?

12:57.200 --> 13:00.240
Special centrally located dad bag?

13:00.240 --> 13:04.320
Is that when I fill up, I buy myself a little treat?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.000
Because I've earned it,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.480
and no one appreciates the hard work I do around here?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.120
Dad, you know-

13:11.120 --> 13:14.560
I just like to watch one episode of a car show

13:14.560 --> 13:18.320
without somebody interrupting me while I fill up my special big boy bag.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.160
It's just dad's central sack for fat trash.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.560
I'm spiraling here.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.800
I just need to know if there's-

13:26.800 --> 13:27.680
If you have a-

13:27.680 --> 13:29.600
I have a kitchen trash can.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.400
Uh-huh, yeah.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.800
If someone has a large piece of trash,

13:32.800 --> 13:35.680
and I keep saying somewhat when I mean my wife,

13:35.680 --> 13:36.960
my kids don't throw away shit.

13:37.520 --> 13:44.000
When my wife throws away the large bag of trash,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.400
a large piece of trash in the kitchen trash can

13:47.200 --> 13:49.040
that fills up a lot of the trash can,

13:49.600 --> 13:51.200
I get very frustrated,

13:51.200 --> 13:56.000
and I ask that we take larger pieces of trash directly out to the cans

13:56.000 --> 14:01.600
instead of sullying the trash bag with-

14:01.600 --> 14:04.080
It does sound like you've introduced a middleman though.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.680
A middle option, a middle-

14:05.680 --> 14:07.760
A third path that isn't-

14:07.760 --> 14:10.000
That's a perfectly good half-filled bag right there.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.520
And it's a fat sack.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.000
It's a fat sack.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.120
That's only when the sack is not in play.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.480
When the sack's in play, everything goes in the sack.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.640
If the kids leave toys out too long,

14:20.640 --> 14:22.480
and I don't think that they treasure it,

14:22.480 --> 14:23.840
it goes right in the sack.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.920
The sack's right there.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.400
Hey, can I do a Yahoo-

14:26.400 --> 14:30.000
Sometimes I just want to put all my worries and troubles in that sack.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.880
You know what I mean?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.440
I just want to take, oh, I got a lot weighing on me.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.680
What if I just put them all in my big boy sack

14:35.680 --> 14:37.120
and threw it right away, you know?

14:37.680 --> 14:38.180
Yeah.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.520
I got a Yahoo here that was sent in by several people.

14:41.520 --> 14:41.840
Thank you.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user James who asks,

14:46.240 --> 14:48.480
can I bring in some of my own ingredients

14:48.480 --> 14:50.400
for them to put on my Subway sub?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.600
Oh, such a good question, James.

14:53.600 --> 14:58.400
It's a, this is a fast food restaurant

14:58.400 --> 15:00.240
where they make sandwiches and they do have,

15:00.240 --> 15:02.720
they've got a little, it's weird, huh?

15:02.720 --> 15:05.440
They've got like a buffet, but just for them.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.520
Yeah, how greedy.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.800
You ever think about that?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.680
You should, if there was no sneeze guard there,

15:11.680 --> 15:15.280
which in the current sort of climate would be unthinkable,

15:15.280 --> 15:17.040
but if there was no sneeze guard there,

15:17.040 --> 15:18.640
you could just do it yourself

15:19.520 --> 15:23.120
and you wouldn't need them to necessarily be a part of that process.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.240
But if you could do it yourself, if there was no sneeze guard,

15:26.240 --> 15:28.720
if we could democratize the Subway process,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.280
then there would be nothing stopping you

15:31.280 --> 15:34.720
from like slopping in your own homemade horseradish on there or whatever.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.560
I'll tell you what I have always really enjoyed at Subway

15:38.560 --> 15:41.280
is their candor, their honesty.

15:41.280 --> 15:41.600
Sure.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.320
Because one, you get to watch them make the sandwich right there

15:44.320 --> 15:47.120
so you can watch them fuck up the way you want your cheese to go.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.720
It's great because like, no, I said, okay.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.640
But also that they're just straight up like vegetables are worth nothing to us.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.040
We will put as many of those on there as you want.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.400
The cheese and the meat, that's where the money is, baby.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.560
You want more of that, we're gonna charge you.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.400
But you want more spinach?

16:04.400 --> 16:04.960
Fuck it.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.760
Yeah, dude.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.080
Yeah, dude.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.680
I will load that thing down with spinach till we can't close it.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.160
Spinach comes from trees.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.840
There's infinite of those.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.600
I could find spinach outside right now if you want more.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.240
Where am I supposed to get cheese at this time of day?

16:20.240 --> 16:24.240
But this comes from cows and there's only so many of them.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.200
This is what I'm saying.

16:26.320 --> 16:31.440
I measure how much sort of gas I have in the tank

16:31.440 --> 16:34.640
by whether or not I'm willing to ask for green peppers

16:35.360 --> 16:43.680
because I don't want the specificity of green pepper amount

16:43.680 --> 16:46.960
that I need to produce a satisfying sandwich

16:46.960 --> 16:51.280
is such that I don't always want to take that journey

16:51.280 --> 16:53.360
because I don't want to always break down with them like,

16:53.360 --> 16:56.240
you don't understand how little green pepper I want.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.920
You're gonna think that I don't want it.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.480
You're gonna think that I don't actually want the green pepper,

17:02.480 --> 17:06.240
but I do, I just want such a specific amount of green pepper.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.800
You want them to take some slices of green pepper

17:08.800 --> 17:11.280
and just kind of wiggle them over the sandwich

17:11.280 --> 17:14.560
like they're burning sage, but not actually let them touch.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.760
If you could hide it in there so I definitely get all the benefits

17:17.760 --> 17:20.000
but I'm not, maybe wrap it in cheese.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.720
So like, it's later I think,

17:22.720 --> 17:25.120
was there a green pepper on that sandwich?

17:25.120 --> 17:26.480
That's the ideal amount.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.960
Sometimes when I'm feeling really froggy,

17:28.960 --> 17:33.120
I'll do that with mayo, but I'm even more particular about that.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.840
I actually kind of mispronounce mayo

17:35.840 --> 17:39.520
because I want them to put an amount of mayonnaise on the sandwich

17:39.520 --> 17:42.000
where they're not actually sure if I want mayonnaise.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.800
Yes.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.440
That is the exact amount of mayonnaise that I want on the sandwich

17:47.440 --> 17:51.360
where they have plausible mayonnaise deniability.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.880
That's just meat leave-ins.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.480
There's no mayo on this.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.160
No, sir, that was just wet bread.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.880
Nope, you just got a wet slice there, pal.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.800
But can you bring in your, okay, let's take it one step.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.240
Can you bring in your own bread?

18:04.240 --> 18:04.960
I don't think so.

18:04.960 --> 18:09.040
Okay, what if I brought in an ingredient,

18:09.040 --> 18:12.640
they finish the sandwich and then while still standing at the register,

18:12.640 --> 18:16.560
I unwrap it, open the sandwich, put my ingredient in,

18:16.560 --> 18:20.080
close the bread, re-wrap it, all while maintaining eye contact.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.840
That's great.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.280
They're gonna charge you for it.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.200
You could bring in your own slice of ham.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.320
Charge me a corking fee.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.160
Oh, well, a porking fee.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.240
That was good.

18:32.240 --> 18:32.800
Very good.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.280
Yeah, I think you should be able,

18:37.280 --> 18:39.760
is that, is ham what you guys would really bring?

18:39.760 --> 18:42.560
Okay, Subway opens, Subway, they're like,

18:42.560 --> 18:44.480
we got $5 footlong and people love that,

18:44.480 --> 18:46.240
but now we have a new jingle and it's,

18:46.240 --> 18:48.080
bring in your own meat now.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.080
And you can bring in your own, it says,

18:52.080 --> 18:55.680
bring in your own meat now, but you can bring in whatever,

18:55.680 --> 18:57.360
but you can only bring in one thing.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.400
So like, what's the, and this is great,

19:00.400 --> 19:03.200
because then there's a line of people standing six feet apart,

19:03.200 --> 19:05.600
all of them holding their sort of comfort item.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.440
Yes, that they're excited.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.520
I'll bring a toothbrush and a picture of my wife.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.480
Nope, you can do one.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.120
I'm winning that hands on a hard body truck.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.200
Wait, that's not, sorry, that's not what's happening.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.760
Oh man, everybody's gonna be holding bacon,

19:21.760 --> 19:26.240
like a kid who's just won a bunch of tickets at like an arcade

19:26.240 --> 19:28.560
and they're like waving these strings of tickets around,

19:28.560 --> 19:30.000
except it'll be bacon.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.840
No, too much work, too much work.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.080
I don't think you're gonna make it a bacon item.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.960
I think Travis is coming at this from an economic standpoint.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.800
I'm trying to think of like special things

19:38.800 --> 19:41.840
I have in this house that I've always

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
wanted to eat on a Subway sandwich.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.480
My own sort of Pinsky salami situation, if you will.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.760
Of course, the best looking meat I've never had.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.120
What, Griffin, what's something that you would not,

19:55.760 --> 19:57.680
I feel like the host of Family Feud,

19:57.680 --> 20:00.560
what's something that you would not normally have on a sandwich

20:00.560 --> 20:02.080
that you find yourself craving?

20:02.080 --> 20:07.360
Uh, it's, uh, um, my willy-weenus.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.240
My prince, my prince pee-pee.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.280
I'm trying to think of what they would say on Family Feud.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.560
They would say prince pee-pee?

20:14.560 --> 20:16.000
Doo-doo, doo-doo juice.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.280
They say like wild shit.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.520
Yeah, show me doo-doo juice.

20:20.080 --> 20:20.320
Yeah.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.920
Oh, it's up there, it's number one.

20:22.960 --> 20:23.760
Wow.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.360
Making whoopee.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.160
100% of people said doo-doo juice.

20:28.160 --> 20:28.660
Whoa.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.940
Oh, wow, we asked a million people

20:31.940 --> 20:34.500
and 100% of them said doo-doo juice.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.700
Probably CBD, right?

20:36.340 --> 20:37.460
Oh, that'd be great.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.260
They're not gonna sell that to you at Subway.

20:40.260 --> 20:41.860
No, they could.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.460
That's how you know things are done.

20:43.460 --> 20:44.260
They could.

20:44.260 --> 20:44.820
They could.

20:44.820 --> 20:45.300
They won't.

20:45.300 --> 20:45.780
They could.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.900
We have CB, we have CBD pepperoncini.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.260
A CBD LT.

20:55.460 --> 20:55.960
Yes.

20:56.820 --> 20:57.460
Well, that's it.

20:57.460 --> 20:59.220
That's the end of that bit.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.180
That's the end of that bit.

21:00.180 --> 21:00.740
Put it to bed.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.340
That's the end of that bit.

21:03.940 --> 21:06.420
I recently discovered that my boyfriend's dad drives.

21:06.420 --> 21:07.300
We should do that more.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.460
Didn't that feel really clean to me?

21:09.460 --> 21:12.340
I really like that sort of laugh-in style,

21:12.340 --> 21:14.260
like hee-haw transition.

21:14.260 --> 21:14.760
Okay.

21:15.780 --> 21:17.620
Well, I'll put that on a donkey.

21:17.620 --> 21:34.500
I recently discovered that my boyfriend's dad

21:34.500 --> 21:37.220
drives Lyft on the side to pick up Semester Cache.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.140
The problem with this is that I use Lyft.

21:39.140 --> 21:41.380
My boyfriend and I have been dating for four years.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.380
I consider myself to be close to the parts of his family,

21:43.380 --> 21:44.580
just not his dad.

21:44.580 --> 21:46.020
He's really nice-seeming.

21:46.020 --> 21:49.060
We just haven't had many chances to interact.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.220
If I were to call Lyft and his dad was the driver,

21:51.220 --> 21:52.260
would I have to sit in the front

21:52.260 --> 21:53.620
and try to make small talk with him?

21:53.620 --> 21:55.620
Or would it be okay for me to sit quietly in the back

21:55.620 --> 21:56.580
like I normally would?

21:58.340 --> 21:58.980
Oh, boy.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.060
Wow, this is fraught.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.860
Until I read this question,

22:04.500 --> 22:09.060
the idea of calling a Lyft and having it be someone I knew driving

22:09.060 --> 22:10.420
had never occurred to me.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.860
Yeah, because the question of where to sit.

22:13.860 --> 22:19.140
And I feel like you do have the built-in excuse right now

22:19.140 --> 22:21.540
of social distancing.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.220
So it's like, I got to sit catty corner.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.340
Oh, that's good.

22:24.340 --> 22:24.980
Yeah.

22:24.980 --> 22:25.940
I mean, it's not just good.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.060
It's the truth.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.300
If you're doing anything other than catty corner,

22:29.300 --> 22:31.060
then you're part of the problem.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.540
You could always sketch on the back.

22:34.340 --> 22:35.780
Sketching on the back is cool.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.780
You definitely can't treat it like a regular Lyft.

22:39.780 --> 22:41.620
I mean, unless-

22:41.620 --> 22:47.300
Unless you're going to do the mask thing.

22:47.300 --> 22:47.800
Yeah.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.060
You guys been doing the mask thing?

22:51.060 --> 22:53.780
You mean wearing a mask to keep other people alive?

22:53.780 --> 22:54.820
Yes, Justin, I have.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.420
Well, good, Travis.

22:56.420 --> 22:56.740
That's good.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.340
Everybody should be doing that, obviously.

22:58.340 --> 22:58.840
But-

22:59.140 --> 23:00.820
No, Justin just said like the mask thing,

23:00.820 --> 23:02.900
like it was a cool life hack, keep it out.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.660
Travis cleans up after his dog

23:04.660 --> 23:06.820
and doesn't spread a pandemic and he's like,

23:06.820 --> 23:07.460
you know what?

23:07.460 --> 23:08.740
I do want a parade.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.500
I want a parade and a trophy that says,

23:10.500 --> 23:12.180
Travis McRoy, bare minimum.

23:12.900 --> 23:13.540
Bare minimum.

23:14.740 --> 23:16.340
But it's B-E-A-R

23:16.340 --> 23:18.100
and there's a little bear on top of the trophy.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.980
You wear the mask and you're at the store

23:20.980 --> 23:23.060
and you see someone you definitely know

23:23.060 --> 23:25.140
and you just absolutely play it off

23:25.140 --> 23:28.020
because it's like, no, you're not going to get me this time.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.500
I have plausible deniability.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.700
I mean, especially if you wear one of the plastic shield masks

23:33.700 --> 23:37.220
and a hat, you are a ghost, my friends.

23:37.220 --> 23:39.700
When you asked if we were doing the mask thing, Justin,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.900
I thought you were talking about when the cops,

23:42.900 --> 23:44.340
when there's a bunch of cops

23:44.340 --> 23:45.620
and they're about to arrest you,

23:45.620 --> 23:47.300
but then you're like,

23:47.300 --> 23:48.740
they call me Cuban Pete,

23:49.700 --> 23:51.060
I'm the king of the Rumblebee

23:51.060 --> 23:52.980
and you do a dance and then-

23:52.980 --> 23:54.500
There are very few social problems.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.220
I mean, to be fair,

23:55.940 --> 23:59.140
the mask would fix this problem with the lift

23:59.140 --> 24:02.180
because it would turn into like a huge stretch limo

24:02.180 --> 24:10.820
and your boyfriend's dad would be like a cool wolf or something.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.420
Yeah, man, that'd be badass.

24:12.420 --> 24:13.300
That'd be pretty cool

24:13.300 --> 24:16.100
and you roll up to the coconut club or whatever

24:16.100 --> 24:17.460
and there's Cameron Diaz

24:17.460 --> 24:21.540
and I guess you seduce her with your cool dancing?

24:22.580 --> 24:24.980
Wouldn't it be cool to have a mask mask

24:24.980 --> 24:26.820
and you could just put it on and act a fool?

24:28.580 --> 24:30.660
Not with his zany powers, you're saying.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.220
You're just wearing a mask off the mask.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.260
You pretend that you have his zany powers.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.100
I think everybody would get a big kick out of that.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.100
Oh yeah, I think everyone in this day and age,

24:40.100 --> 24:41.860
everyone needs that kind of levity.

24:41.860 --> 24:42.420
You know what I mean?

24:42.420 --> 24:44.020
That's what the world is missing,

24:44.020 --> 24:46.260
more mask-based humor.

24:46.260 --> 24:48.260
Well then maybe everybody's uncles and aunts

24:48.260 --> 24:49.620
who are still really up in arms

24:49.620 --> 24:51.620
about the whole pandemic mask thing,

24:52.420 --> 24:54.100
maybe we can get them on board

24:54.660 --> 24:56.660
because everybody loves Jim Carries the Mask.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.940
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:57.940 --> 24:58.820
So like you have that

24:58.820 --> 25:01.540
and then you can also say like this will nullify

25:01.540 --> 25:04.260
certain social expectations when you wear this

25:04.260 --> 25:06.740
and you can do a funny like rumba dance

25:08.020 --> 25:08.820
and rob a bank.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.980
It would be funny to put on a surgical mask

25:12.980 --> 25:15.620
and then put on the mask mask over that mask

25:16.260 --> 25:18.740
and so people would think you're just acting a fool

25:18.740 --> 25:21.540
and being silly but actually you're being very conscientious

25:21.540 --> 25:23.460
and then when you get in and people are like,

25:23.460 --> 25:24.420
what are you doing?

25:24.420 --> 25:32.180
You're like, I guess I misunderstood, sorry.

25:32.180 --> 25:35.620
P-A-R-T-Y, there's a pandemic on

25:35.620 --> 25:38.180
and let me show you some literature about it.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.660
What if you did surgical mask?

25:40.660 --> 25:41.940
Somebody shop me.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.100
I can't do my shopping for myself

25:46.100 --> 25:47.380
because I wore a mask mask.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.700
Okay, you wear a surgical mask underneath,

25:49.700 --> 25:51.140
then you wear the mask over it

25:51.140 --> 25:53.380
and then you wear a surgical mask over that

25:53.380 --> 25:54.740
so people will see it and like,

25:54.740 --> 25:56.660
oh, he's a whimsical party man

25:56.660 --> 25:58.660
but he still understands the importance

25:58.660 --> 26:00.580
of controlling the pandemic.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.340
I respect him for that.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.460
Man, the mask is funny.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.780
Man, it's fucking funny as shit.

26:05.780 --> 26:09.060
It's both funny, it's weird, it's funny to watch

26:09.060 --> 26:10.420
but also funny to talk about.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.900
Yeah, you remember when the dog pees all over that guy

26:12.900 --> 26:14.020
because he's wearing the mask

26:14.020 --> 26:15.700
and it's like a fucking waterfall.

26:18.020 --> 26:18.980
That's a good one

26:19.540 --> 26:21.940
and when he eats the bomb and it explodes in his tummy,

26:21.940 --> 26:24.580
he goes, that's a spicy meatball.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.860
Travis, do eight more mask jokes

26:27.860 --> 26:29.140
to get us to around 10.

26:30.420 --> 26:36.660
Do you remember when he's there with Ben Stein

26:36.660 --> 26:38.900
and he tries to put the mask on but it doesn't work

26:38.900 --> 26:42.580
so Jim Carrey in his classic rubber face style

26:42.580 --> 26:44.820
just throws himself around for a while.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.620
That's one.

26:46.420 --> 26:47.300
There's another one

26:47.940 --> 26:49.940
where the clock is bouncing around the hallway

26:49.940 --> 26:51.300
and he's trying to smash it with a hammer.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.580
That's two, Jesse, he's gonna do it.

26:52.580 --> 26:53.620
That's a good one.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.300
He's gonna do it, that's two, Travis.

26:55.300 --> 26:58.180
Six more, six more, six more, bud.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.660
He says, love is but a red, red rose

27:00.660 --> 27:03.220
and I am a little thorny and that's pretty good.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.580
Oh yeah, Trav, oh yeah, bud.

27:04.580 --> 27:06.820
There's another part where the cops are frisking him

27:06.820 --> 27:08.260
and they're reaching in his pockets

27:08.260 --> 27:09.860
and he's like a little to the left

27:09.860 --> 27:12.020
and makes a joke like it's his penis.

27:12.020 --> 27:13.060
That's four more, baby.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.340
Travis, you're halfway home, come on.

27:14.340 --> 27:17.540
And then there's the part where the old lady comes out,

27:17.540 --> 27:20.260
like his landlady comes out of her apartment

27:20.260 --> 27:22.420
and she has like a green face mask on

27:22.420 --> 27:23.460
and he's wearing a green mask

27:23.460 --> 27:25.860
and they scream at each other and that's pretty good.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.540
She's gonna do it, Jesse's gonna do it.

27:28.420 --> 27:32.260
There's another part where he's kind of spinning around

27:32.260 --> 27:33.540
and he's turning into the mask

27:33.540 --> 27:35.460
and then he stops and he catches the feather

27:36.100 --> 27:38.340
and he says, somebody stop me.

27:38.340 --> 27:39.060
Okay.

27:39.060 --> 27:41.140
But he says it in like a really funny way.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.900
Yeah, okay, we'll give it to you.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.660
Two more, Trav, come on, you can do this.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.220
There's a part where the cops come

27:49.220 --> 27:51.460
and he tries to run away and they say freeze

27:51.460 --> 27:53.540
and he turns to ice in midair and they say,

27:53.540 --> 27:55.860
put your hands up and he says, but you told me to freeze.

27:55.860 --> 27:59.860
Now listen, back in episode 406, Travis got to nine

27:59.860 --> 28:01.300
and this is where he shipped the bag.

28:02.500 --> 28:06.180
So Travis, we really wanna see if you can land the plane.

28:06.180 --> 28:08.180
Is there anything?

28:08.180 --> 28:11.060
You gotta have at least a little bit more juice in the tank.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.340
Come on, bud, get us there.

28:13.620 --> 28:18.980
There's a part where the two guys who like-

28:18.980 --> 28:19.220
Uh-huh.

28:19.220 --> 28:21.940
Tried to charge Stanley extra for fixing the car.

28:21.940 --> 28:22.660
Yeah.

28:22.660 --> 28:25.380
And then the mask shoves the mufflers up their butts.

28:26.180 --> 28:27.380
Yes!

28:27.380 --> 28:28.100
Yes!

28:28.100 --> 28:31.060
He did it, ladies and gentlemen, he did it!

28:31.060 --> 28:33.460
Amazing, amazing.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.260
Travis, I just re-watched it last night.

28:38.260 --> 28:56.020
Let's take a break, we're gonna head on over to the money section.

28:56.020 --> 28:59.220
Do either one of you nerds wanna take this first one?

28:59.220 --> 29:02.740
Okay, yes, I wanna tell you about Warby Parker.

29:03.780 --> 29:05.300
They make glasses.

29:05.300 --> 29:06.500
I know what you're thinking.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.780
A lot of people make glasses.

29:07.780 --> 29:08.900
I make glasses.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.540
But do you make boutique quality eyewear

29:11.540 --> 29:13.460
at a revolutionary price point?

29:13.460 --> 29:16.580
You don't, so shut up and let me finish this ad.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.460
Warby Parker offers eyeglasses, sunglasses,

29:19.460 --> 29:21.620

29:24.020 --> 29:25.940

29:25.940 --> 29:27.620
I wear Warby Parker glasses.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.140
I love Warby Parker glasses.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.380
My favorite part is the home try-on program

29:31.380 --> 29:33.380
where they will send, like you pick out the frames

29:33.380 --> 29:35.380
you wanna try on, they send them to you,

29:35.380 --> 29:37.140
you try them on, and here's the thing, folks,

29:37.140 --> 29:40.020
this is news to no one, I have a gigantic head,

29:40.020 --> 29:42.260
and so I'm always wary of buying glasses online.

29:42.900 --> 29:44.900
But Warby Parker sends me, I try them on,

29:44.900 --> 29:47.380
I go, oh, these actually fit, this is incredible.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.460
Or, nope, my melon's still too big

29:49.460 --> 29:50.980
and I have to send some back,

29:50.980 --> 29:53.620
and I don't pay for the ones I don't keep.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.300
It's a great deal.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.140
And Warby Parker is committed to providing

29:57.140 --> 29:59.860

If you are wanting to take a break from the outside world,

30:32.820 --> 30:37.300
wanting to isolate even deeper into your own subconscious,

30:37.300 --> 30:38.340
and who can blame you,

30:39.540 --> 30:42.660
then reach for a pair of Raycon earbuds.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.300

31:34.340 --> 31:36.820
I should say our lawyer is sitting right next to me.

31:36.820 --> 31:38.820
They just handed me a piece of paper that says,

31:38.820 --> 31:41.380
I have to tell you, don't eat earbuds.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.380
Now my skateboard lawyers are sitting next to me

31:45.380 --> 31:46.820
and they're giving me a big thumbs up

31:46.820 --> 31:48.180
and they're shaking their head yes.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.740
So I don't know if that means you can eat earbuds.

31:51.700 --> 31:52.580
They're doing it again.

31:53.460 --> 31:55.540
God, these guys, man, they're such bad lawyers.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.820
Why did we get these terrible lawyers?

31:58.820 --> 32:00.180
My lawyer is good.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.380
My lawyer.

32:01.380 --> 32:01.700
Fuck.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.460
One, two, one, two, three, four.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.020
Hi, everybody.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

32:07.140 --> 32:07.940
I'm Sydney McElroy.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.380
We're both doctors and-

32:09.380 --> 32:10.180
Nope, just me.

32:10.180 --> 32:13.220
Okay, well Sydney's a doctor and I'm a medical enthusiast

32:13.220 --> 32:16.740
and we create Sawbones, a marital tour of misguided medicine.

32:16.740 --> 32:19.300
Every week I dig through the annals of medical history

32:19.300 --> 32:24.660
to bring you the wildest, grossest, sometimes dumbest tales

32:24.660 --> 32:26.980
of ways we've tried to treat people throughout history.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.700
Lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine

32:29.700 --> 32:31.620
because everything's a disaster,

32:31.620 --> 32:34.340
but it's slightly less of a disaster every Friday

32:34.340 --> 32:35.700
right here on MaximumFun.org

32:35.700 --> 32:36.660
as we bring you Sawbones,

32:36.660 --> 32:38.580
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

32:38.580 --> 32:39.300
And remember-

32:39.300 --> 32:41.380
Don't drill a hole in your head.

32:44.900 --> 32:45.700
You want a Yahoo?

32:46.420 --> 32:47.460
Yeah, I'd like that.

32:47.460 --> 32:47.860
Okay.

32:47.860 --> 32:50.740
This Yahoo was sent in by Molly

32:50.740 --> 32:52.180
and I guess you're not gonna interrupt me.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.220
That feels good.

32:53.220 --> 32:53.700
Thanks, Molly.

32:53.700 --> 32:56.900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Copperman asks-

32:57.540 --> 32:58.500
Oh, I get it.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.100
It's like Iron Man, but okay.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.380
That's funny, I didn't think about that.

33:01.380 --> 33:01.880
Very good.

33:02.820 --> 33:03.460
And this-

33:03.460 --> 33:03.940
I'm liking this.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.140
I'm liking it already.

33:05.140 --> 33:06.820
And this seems like something

33:06.820 --> 33:09.540
that the bad boy Tony Stark himself would say,

33:09.540 --> 33:12.820
which is why are plungers handle rods so short?

33:14.420 --> 33:14.920
Right?

33:15.220 --> 33:17.620
I feel like I'm already elbow deep in there.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.260
Regular plungers consist of an elastic suction cup

33:20.260 --> 33:22.580
and a wooden handle rod that is attached to it.

33:22.580 --> 33:26.180
The wooden hand, if you have never plunged,

33:26.180 --> 33:27.380
do you think that's possible?

33:28.660 --> 33:32.100
I mean, maybe some people only have narrow shits.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.020
Perfect, Duke.

33:34.020 --> 33:34.660
I guess so.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.180
It's our third time talking about poop in this episode.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.540
Stinky snakes every time.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.540
The wooden handle rod is intended to be held

33:41.540 --> 33:43.780
and used by the plunger operator to forcefully compress

33:43.780 --> 33:44.980
and decompress the suction cup

33:44.980 --> 33:46.580
and its contents by pushing and pulling.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.660
All right, Bill Nye, we fucking get it.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.380
Another commonality among many regular plungers

33:51.380 --> 33:52.980
is that the wooden rod is rather short,

33:52.980 --> 33:55.140
forcing your wrists and forearms to be rather close

33:55.140 --> 33:57.940
to the suction cup and what's below it.

33:58.740 --> 34:01.940
So I ask, why are the wooden rods as short as they usually are?

34:01.940 --> 34:03.940
Shouldn't they be longer to allow for some action

34:03.940 --> 34:06.020
at greater distance to the whirling toilet water

34:06.020 --> 34:08.580
and whatever happens to be part of said whirling waters?

34:09.140 --> 34:11.460
I've always wanted them to be broom handle length.

34:12.260 --> 34:15.060
So I can stand on top of the counter right next to it

34:15.060 --> 34:18.340
and jump off and really get some good action going.

34:18.340 --> 34:19.220
You know what I mean?

34:19.220 --> 34:22.180
Because sometimes just the like two feet that they give me

34:22.180 --> 34:25.060
isn't enough to get the torque I need

34:25.060 --> 34:26.820
to get the clog out of there.

34:26.820 --> 34:27.540
You know what I mean?

34:27.540 --> 34:30.420
I need to really get in there.

34:30.420 --> 34:35.220
Yeah, and you like it when it's a sort of Darth Maul

34:35.220 --> 34:37.620
double-bladed plunger saber situation

34:37.620 --> 34:40.420
where it's a long stick and on one side is the normal plunger

34:40.420 --> 34:44.020
and but then on the other side is like an almost comedically

34:44.020 --> 34:47.140
large, the mask-sized plunger cup.

34:47.140 --> 34:50.580
And that one goes that one goes over the whole toilet

34:50.580 --> 34:53.060
and Travis likes to do that and yell for people to come in.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.340
Like guys, get in here, get in here.

34:54.340 --> 34:55.620
You got to see this, you got to see this.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.060
You'll never believe what I'm doing.

34:57.060 --> 34:58.020
But people are always like-

34:58.020 --> 35:01.140
I plunge and I pull up and there's Jimmy Hoffa's body, right?

35:01.940 --> 35:03.220
It's great, everyone loves it.

35:03.220 --> 35:04.340
And people laugh and they're like,

35:04.340 --> 35:06.500
you're doing the big plunger trick again, aren't you?

35:06.500 --> 35:08.980
We don't have to come in, we have seen it.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.780
Yeah, I've lost a lot of friends.

35:11.780 --> 35:14.020
It's a very good tiny plunger card trick

35:14.020 --> 35:15.780
and you can order the tiny plunger

35:15.780 --> 35:17.220
and they'll send you a DVD with it

35:17.220 --> 35:19.460
that says how to do the tiny plunger card trick.

35:19.460 --> 35:20.980
Hey, it's 2020.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.300
How has plunger technology not evolved?

35:23.860 --> 35:27.300
Have we not moved beyond we put a big duke in there,

35:27.300 --> 35:28.740
clog the whole thing up.

35:28.740 --> 35:32.340
Here's like a suction cup and a wooden stick, go to work.

35:33.060 --> 35:35.540
I think it has evolved because there's some

35:36.100 --> 35:41.380
where there's kind of a flange at the bottom where it flanges in

35:42.100 --> 35:44.500
and then there's just the regular Mario ones.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.140
But.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.980
And I do, it does concern me

35:48.980 --> 35:52.900
because if we figured out the flange is better,

35:53.620 --> 35:56.980
we should have thrown all those other ones away, right?

35:56.980 --> 36:00.020
We wanna do this job once and we wanna do it right.

36:00.020 --> 36:00.980
No, you know what?

36:00.980 --> 36:02.900
I've talked about it before, I'm a disruptor.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.100
I'm gonna disrupt the whole thing.

36:04.980 --> 36:08.420
Fucking big plungers out here taking your money.

36:08.420 --> 36:10.180
Hey, everybody, here's a news flash,

36:10.180 --> 36:13.460
invest in my company, biggerpipes.com.

36:13.460 --> 36:13.700
Yeah.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.620
Wait, no, don't go to biggerpipes.com.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.580
No, let's do it.

36:16.580 --> 36:17.780
No, no, oh shit.

36:18.340 --> 36:21.460
Here's the thing, if we still need plungers,

36:21.460 --> 36:23.700
maybe the problem isn't our dukes,

36:24.340 --> 36:26.900
maybe it's that the toilet pipes is too dang small.

36:27.460 --> 36:30.980
Why haven't we made bigger toilet pipes at this point, right?

36:30.980 --> 36:34.020
Yeah, you are talking about Mario size pipes

36:34.020 --> 36:35.620
that you could go on an adventure down.

36:36.340 --> 36:38.660
I'm just saying that I think the only reason

36:38.660 --> 36:41.220
toilet pipes are so small, and I'm sorry, plumbers,

36:41.220 --> 36:44.420
I'm sorry you have to hear me say this and blow up your spot like this,

36:44.420 --> 36:47.620
but it's because big plumbers is keeping them small

36:47.620 --> 36:48.740
so that they're in a job.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.660
I'm saying, give me a big old powerful pipe

36:51.220 --> 36:55.140
that I can send whatever size duke I make down

36:55.140 --> 36:57.300
without having to worry about it, you know what I mean?

36:57.300 --> 37:00.180
Why are you holding me hostage in my latrine?

37:01.460 --> 37:03.460
Now, Travis, when he says big plumbers,

37:03.460 --> 37:06.100
he is not talking about the plumbing industry.

37:06.100 --> 37:09.540
He is talking about the eight and a half foot tall

37:09.540 --> 37:12.420
sort of monster man that does come to his house

37:12.420 --> 37:14.340
whenever they have a plumbing emergency.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.900
Well, he lives in my house technically at this point.

37:16.900 --> 37:20.820
Would terrorize Travis be a fair verb to use

37:20.820 --> 37:22.660
for what the big plumber does to you?

37:22.660 --> 37:24.180
Yeah, and you know what?

37:24.180 --> 37:26.580
Not just physically, but emotionally.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.660
Oh, but physically, wicked physically,

37:28.660 --> 37:30.420
like he hurts you a lot.

37:30.420 --> 37:33.220
But he also says mean things about how big my duke was

37:33.220 --> 37:35.940
and how I should be embarrassed and like, this is all my fault

37:35.940 --> 37:38.020
and I've let down everyone.

37:38.020 --> 37:41.700
Yeah, I remember one time he said you had thick pee

37:41.700 --> 37:44.020
and you were like, dang, that stinks.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.700
And then he hurt you, your body.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.380
Yeah, and then he hurt me real bad.

37:47.380 --> 37:48.500
Then also that.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.660
Then he also said that I use toilet paper

37:50.660 --> 37:52.260
like a baby in a cartoon.

37:52.260 --> 37:52.760
Yeah.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.500
And that is true, but it still hurts.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.940
I hate the big plumber.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.700
I think the big plumber sucks.

37:57.700 --> 37:58.580
But you know what?

37:58.580 --> 38:00.660
Also, he pays his rent on time.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.500
No, he does fine, yeah.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.420
I've never had any problems with him

38:04.420 --> 38:06.020
doing his chores on the chore wheel.

38:06.020 --> 38:08.180
So like, there's that, I mean,

38:08.180 --> 38:10.500
he's not the worst roommate I've ever had.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.700
Can I hit you guys with this?

38:12.340 --> 38:13.940
Please don't, I've been hurt so much.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.220
No, okay, but this is different.

38:15.220 --> 38:17.780
This is a, I'm gonna hit you with this idea.

38:17.780 --> 38:19.380
It'll be light, like a cloud.

38:20.260 --> 38:24.100
A stick that is the chore's stick.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.340
And every house has a chore's stick.

38:27.060 --> 38:29.620
And then you have a sort of tackle box

38:29.620 --> 38:33.140
or perhaps a sort of like wheel that goes in your pantry

38:33.140 --> 38:36.260
that has plunger end.

38:37.060 --> 38:39.220
Multiple size plunger ends for Travis

38:39.220 --> 38:43.300
when he needs a special one for his special waste.

38:43.300 --> 38:46.500
But then there can also be broom, mop, swiffer,

38:47.140 --> 38:52.020
fucking angled broom for cleaning off the top of your fan blades.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.820
Which folks, you don't, nobody's gonna look up there.

38:54.820 --> 38:55.300
You're okay.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.780
You could also just get compressed air

38:57.780 --> 38:59.540
for like half the jobs in your house, folks.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.140
Yeah, it's okay.

39:01.140 --> 39:03.220
Or you could just get chore's stick.

39:03.220 --> 39:05.540
Careful about blowing that into your face though, folks.

39:05.540 --> 39:06.260
Compressed air?

39:07.060 --> 39:08.180
Yeah, don't.

39:08.180 --> 39:08.820
Why not?

39:08.820 --> 39:09.380
Don't do it.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.380
It's not good for you, it's dangerous.

39:11.380 --> 39:12.180
It's too cold.

39:12.180 --> 39:14.340
Give yourself a fucking embolism, it's no good.

39:14.340 --> 39:18.340
But chore's stick is safe and it's efficient.

39:18.340 --> 39:20.980
Okay, so we got chore's stick, we got big pipes.

39:20.980 --> 39:22.580
Justin, what have you got to solve this?

39:24.420 --> 39:25.300
Moving.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.140
Oh, this is a new house.

39:27.140 --> 39:32.100
So you clog the toilet and you just pack up, move it on.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.780
Pack your bags and move away, exactly.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.060
It's been a long time.

39:35.540 --> 39:40.100
Wouldn't that hurt the resale value of the befouled house?

39:41.220 --> 39:42.340
Keep that door locked.

39:43.060 --> 39:44.260
Tell them somebody died.

39:44.260 --> 39:47.300
Yeah, that you break, cat, that it's the Duke of Amontillado.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.100
You just fucking cover it up.

39:50.100 --> 39:51.380
Don't, we don't go in there.

39:51.380 --> 39:52.900
There's no, there used to be a, there did not.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.020
I thought you said this was two and a half bath.

39:54.020 --> 39:54.900
It's two bath.

39:54.900 --> 39:55.940
Now let's move on.

39:55.940 --> 39:56.740
Now let's move on.

39:57.780 --> 40:00.980
It's two and a quarter bath, because I drew in the toilet.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.660
Did you brick up your toilet?

40:02.660 --> 40:03.380
I sure did.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.460
It's a pee-pee one.

40:08.100 --> 40:11.060
So it's two and a quarter, two and a quarter bath.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.260
Just pee-pee in there and leave.

40:12.820 --> 40:14.260
Don't ask a lot of questions.

40:15.460 --> 40:19.860
You could pay, you could maybe, this toilet is permanently clogged,

40:19.860 --> 40:22.500
but you could probably pee-pee it at 12 more times.

40:22.500 --> 40:30.420
So please choose wisely while you're living in that home.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.180
Hey man, is it cool if I use your bathroom?

40:32.180 --> 40:32.900
No, not that one.

40:32.900 --> 40:34.740
Well, I got four left that I'm saving up.

40:34.740 --> 40:36.580
I got four left.

40:36.580 --> 40:38.180
It's like that Eddie Murphy movie.

40:39.380 --> 40:40.100
Pluto Nash?

40:40.100 --> 40:40.660
The Clumps.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.300
Pluto Nash.

40:41.300 --> 40:41.860
The Clumps.

40:42.420 --> 40:43.140
Pluto Nash.

40:43.140 --> 40:53.220
I'd like to welcome everyone to a new segment Munch Squad Investigates.

40:53.220 --> 40:54.420
That was terrifying.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.980
That was really scary.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.820
There's been a burger murder.

41:00.820 --> 41:04.500
In this one, we're gonna find them and we're gonna put them on blast.

41:04.500 --> 41:08.820
This is a new public service that we're doing on the Munch Squad.

41:08.820 --> 41:13.620
We're gonna find secret restaurants and we're gonna unearth-

41:13.620 --> 41:14.120
Wait.

41:14.820 --> 41:15.540
How secret?

41:15.540 --> 41:16.020
I have-

41:16.020 --> 41:16.520
How?

41:17.540 --> 41:18.260
Secret.

41:18.260 --> 41:21.620
Secret because they are pretending to be a different restaurant than they are.

41:21.620 --> 41:24.260
And I am going to help you unearth this.

41:24.260 --> 41:27.460
I encountered this in my own life with It's Just Wings,

41:27.460 --> 41:28.900
which popped up on DoorDash.

41:28.900 --> 41:32.500
And I was like, ah damn, I would love some wings right now.

41:32.500 --> 41:35.220
And Sydney looked at the menu and I said, what's on the menu?

41:35.220 --> 41:39.860
And she she scrolled through and she said, um, It's Just Wings.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.300
I was like, that can't be right.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.980
Everybody's got to have some add-ons.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.820
Turns out they also had curly fries in this heaven menu.

41:46.820 --> 41:48.260
That did a little digging.

41:48.260 --> 41:48.760
Yeah.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.940
It's Chili's.

41:51.940 --> 41:52.440
Wait.

41:53.700 --> 41:54.200
What?

41:55.540 --> 41:56.740
Yeah, yeah.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.580
This restaurant that they pretended was another restaurant is actually-

42:00.580 --> 42:01.620
It's Just Wings?

42:01.620 --> 42:02.820
It's not Just Wings.

42:02.820 --> 42:03.860
It's Just Chili's.

42:03.860 --> 42:05.460
So it's Just Wings.

42:05.460 --> 42:06.180
Just Wings.

42:07.780 --> 42:11.540
So Chili said, we got a lot of extra wings here that we need to get rid of.

42:12.820 --> 42:17.780
We're going to create a second DoorDash, like, landing page

42:18.500 --> 42:21.460
where we just sell our wings and curly fries?

42:22.340 --> 42:25.620
It's just they pretend it's a new restaurant.

42:25.620 --> 42:29.380
A new delicious restaurant where it's just wings.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.340
But why?

42:30.340 --> 42:31.380
But it's not just wings.

42:31.380 --> 42:32.260
It's just Chili's.

42:32.260 --> 42:33.380
Don't try to fool me.

42:33.380 --> 42:34.180
I have another one.

42:34.180 --> 42:35.220
This is coming in hot.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.140
I need everybody to be aware of this.

42:37.140 --> 42:41.540
Fazzoli's is serving up deep fried wings at their first ghost kitchen in Atlanta,

42:41.540 --> 42:44.740
which is a wild sentence now that I say it out loud.

42:44.740 --> 42:45.700
Hachi machi.

42:46.500 --> 42:49.940
Fazzoli's set up a secret ghost restaurant in Atlanta

42:49.940 --> 42:53.460
to just try to figure out how to do wings good and they'll deliver them to you.

42:54.340 --> 42:55.060
It's no big deal.

42:55.060 --> 42:56.260
It's not the restaurants.

42:56.260 --> 43:00.580
It's just Fazzoli's opened up a wing restaurant run by ghosts.

43:00.580 --> 43:01.700
It's just a ghost kitchen.

43:01.700 --> 43:04.900
And I'm actually kind of proud of them for that, if I'm being honest.

43:04.900 --> 43:09.060
I don't like the treachery, but I do appreciate them being like,

43:09.060 --> 43:13.540
we want to do wings, but we're too nervous to fuck it up in our real stores.

43:13.540 --> 43:17.380
We're going to set up a whole fake front just so we can get good at wings

43:17.380 --> 43:19.380
and then bring them to you, Travis.

43:20.260 --> 43:24.100
The markup on wings must be wild because I got another one for you.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.780
Neighborhood wings.

43:25.780 --> 43:26.260
Okay.

43:26.260 --> 43:27.620
There's neighborhood wings.

43:27.620 --> 43:31.300
You can get them in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Columbus, Indiana,

43:31.300 --> 43:32.500
Yonkers, New York.

43:33.620 --> 43:35.140
Enjoy some neighborhood wings.

43:35.140 --> 43:36.420
No, where do you?

43:36.420 --> 43:38.820
I'm going to give you all this turned into a game.

43:38.820 --> 43:40.180
Who makes neighborhood wings?

43:40.180 --> 43:40.820
Applebee's.

43:43.860 --> 43:44.580
That's right.

43:44.580 --> 43:45.380
We got them.

43:45.380 --> 43:47.140
Applebee's is neighborhood wings.

43:47.780 --> 43:48.900
Stop lying.

43:48.900 --> 43:53.300
Also, Boston Market is secretly rotisserie roast.

43:53.300 --> 43:56.260
I'm not even going to play the sound effect because you could have guessed that one.

43:56.260 --> 43:56.760
Why?

43:57.380 --> 43:59.860
I'm still caught up in the psychology of this.

43:59.860 --> 44:02.580
Why is Applebee's like, we need to move our wings?

44:02.580 --> 44:03.220
I'll tell you why.

44:04.100 --> 44:04.500
Okay.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.620
This is legit.

44:05.620 --> 44:11.780
Like, Chili's and Applebee's, like, Millennials, Gin's, Zoomers,

44:11.780 --> 44:17.620
they're not going to Applebee's and Chili's because of the shame associated with them.

44:18.580 --> 44:20.500
But those wings don't lie.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.220
Like, the wings are their wings.

44:23.940 --> 44:26.980
And so if they can call them something cool,

44:26.980 --> 44:29.700
like Tony Hawk's extreme wings or something like that,

44:29.700 --> 44:34.500
like something that Zoomers love, then it's, then, you know, you can do a trick on them.

44:34.980 --> 44:41.140
So you're telling me they looked at what Chuck E. Cheese did and they said, that was great.

44:41.140 --> 44:42.100
That's a great idea.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.140
We're just going to do that.

44:43.140 --> 44:43.640
Yeah.

44:43.640 --> 44:46.660
We all know Chuck E. Cheese's Pasquale's Pizza and wings, right?

44:46.660 --> 44:49.460
If you see a Pasquale's Pizza, you know that's Chuck E. Cheese.

44:50.260 --> 44:52.740
I do also want to warn everyone.

44:52.740 --> 45:00.420
Bucca di Beppo did a pizza one that's called P.Za, which I do have to give it up for.

45:00.420 --> 45:00.980
I like that.

45:00.980 --> 45:02.420
That's very good.

45:02.420 --> 45:03.460
That's very good.

45:03.460 --> 45:04.340
And one more.

45:06.580 --> 45:12.740
Hooters open up one called Hootie's Burger Bar, which you could do better than that.

45:12.740 --> 45:13.540
That was not a very good-

45:13.540 --> 45:14.100
But that's a primo example.

45:14.100 --> 45:16.180
Lesson is to tie in with Darius Rucker.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.140
There's no Darius Rucker.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.860
That's a primo example, though, of,

45:21.860 --> 45:27.620
I've never been to a Hooters because of the sort of it's whole steez.

45:29.140 --> 45:33.380
But maybe the food is phenomenal and now I can go to Hootie's

45:33.380 --> 45:35.780
and it can be whatever I need it to be.

45:36.900 --> 45:39.940
A little more formal, a little more refined.

45:39.940 --> 45:42.180
I mean, you have to think the food is good at Hooters.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.620
Why else would people go there?

45:44.660 --> 45:45.220
Okay.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.140
I don't actually want to talk about Hooters.

45:48.820 --> 45:49.380
I'm sorry.

45:49.380 --> 45:57.300
I do want to say, though, I haven't much about Junior, too.

45:57.300 --> 46:01.860
If I could just tack this on real quick, because in these corona times,

46:01.860 --> 46:07.380
I think that we're all sort of reeling and figuring out how to deal with it.

46:08.020 --> 46:12.900
And the way that the Sour Patch Kids pop-up store in New York City is dealing with it

46:12.900 --> 46:16.420
is to be open for you to go to.

46:16.420 --> 46:20.340
Have you ever opened a bag of Sour Patch Kids candy only to think,

46:20.340 --> 46:24.340
what if I could live in this incredible Sour Then Sweet experience?

46:24.340 --> 46:25.700
Well, think no longer.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.940
The Sour Patch Kids store is here.

46:27.940 --> 46:32.100
That's right, wall-to-wall Sour Then Sweet awesomeness

46:32.100 --> 46:34.340
right in the heart of New York City.

46:34.340 --> 46:38.980
Express your inner Sour Patch Kids style with our new merchandise.

46:38.980 --> 46:42.340
Elevate your sour taste buds at our sweets bar.

46:42.340 --> 46:44.900
And of course, create your perfect candy mix

46:44.900 --> 46:48.340
with your favorite Sour Patch Kids varieties.

46:48.340 --> 46:49.540
And then kill your grandma.

46:49.540 --> 46:53.380
I'm sorry, I misread.

46:53.380 --> 46:55.780
But then it'll do something real sweet.

46:56.500 --> 46:59.860
You'll be like, we did give you coronavirus at our candy store

46:59.860 --> 47:02.740
that killed your grandma, but here's 10 bucks.

47:02.740 --> 47:06.420
The kids may like pranks, but they know visitor safety is no joke.

47:06.980 --> 47:11.460
Visitors to the Sour Patch Kids store will be required to wear face covering

47:11.460 --> 47:14.020
at all times and maintain social distancing.

47:14.020 --> 47:18.020
It does, there is, if you say you have,

47:18.020 --> 47:20.660
if you're gonna be in the Sour Patch Kids New York City store,

47:21.220 --> 47:23.300
you have to wear a face mask.

47:24.100 --> 47:30.100
What you are saying then is by coming into the Sour Patch Kids store,

47:30.100 --> 47:35.140
you're introducing some level of danger into your life, right?

47:35.140 --> 47:35.380
Right.

47:36.100 --> 47:38.260
What level of danger?

47:38.260 --> 47:42.260
How much do you have to fucking love Sour Patch Kids?

47:42.260 --> 47:44.660
Because for me, the amount of danger that is worth

47:44.660 --> 47:47.940
going to the Sour Patch Kids store in New York City is zero.

47:47.940 --> 47:52.580
It is absolute no risk to my safety or my nannies, right?

47:52.580 --> 47:54.420
That's the absolute bare minimum.

47:54.420 --> 47:57.940
Well, maybe it's that you've already done something else dangerous

47:57.940 --> 48:01.300
that was worth it to you, and then you see the Sour Patch Kids store

48:01.300 --> 48:02.660
and you're like, might as well.

48:03.540 --> 48:04.180
I'm already out.

48:06.980 --> 48:07.940
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

48:08.500 --> 48:08.900
Yes.

48:08.900 --> 48:10.180
This one was sent in by Graham Robuck.

48:10.180 --> 48:12.660
Thank you, Graham Robuck, who answers user Servants who asks,

48:13.620 --> 48:17.620
what would you do if you had a friend that went with you everywhere

48:17.620 --> 48:19.220
and kept saying, you're the man.

48:19.220 --> 48:20.100
Yeah, you're the man.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.100
You're the man over and over.

48:24.980 --> 48:25.780
You know?

48:25.780 --> 48:26.660
It'd be cool for...

48:26.660 --> 48:27.780
How long would it be cool for?

48:27.780 --> 48:28.580
I think a couple days.

48:29.700 --> 48:31.060
Oh, I think up to a week.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.140
Went everywhere with me.

48:34.100 --> 48:38.180
Yeah, I mean, I guess that is the fine print

48:38.180 --> 48:42.020
is that they would accompany you to the bathroom,

48:42.020 --> 48:45.460
to the bedroom, to the changing room.

48:45.460 --> 48:47.300
What about when I sleep?

48:47.300 --> 48:48.340
Yeah, you're the man.

48:48.340 --> 48:49.300
Can I still sleep?

48:49.300 --> 48:52.180
You're the man, you're the man, you're the man.

48:52.180 --> 48:53.380
You're sleeping so good.

48:54.260 --> 48:56.180
I'm gonna give you some ASMR.

48:56.180 --> 48:57.460
You're the man, Tingles.

48:57.460 --> 48:58.740
You're sleeping so good.

48:58.740 --> 48:59.780
I'm so proud of you.

49:02.420 --> 49:04.420
I think it would be cool for a while.

49:04.420 --> 49:05.700
I think it'd be cool for a while.

49:05.700 --> 49:09.060
It would actually be not cool instantly for the three of us

49:09.060 --> 49:11.220
because of how it would taint our audio.

49:11.860 --> 49:13.540
Yeah, that would be a problem.

49:13.540 --> 49:16.020
If we did have on this show the three of us,

49:16.900 --> 49:19.700
but then three strangers in the background

49:19.700 --> 49:21.380
all saying you're the man, yeah, you're the man,

49:21.380 --> 49:23.460
you're the man over and over,

49:23.460 --> 49:27.860
I think that would get grating after like half an episode.

49:27.860 --> 49:30.420
You know what, I feel like I worry that it would

49:30.420 --> 49:32.580
after a while become disingenuous

49:32.580 --> 49:34.500
where he's saying you're the man.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.180
How much are we paying this person?

49:36.180 --> 49:38.100
Yeah, and you're like, I'm not the man.

49:38.100 --> 49:41.300
So what I propose five days a week,

49:41.300 --> 49:42.820
you're the man, you're the man, you're the man.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.420
On the sixth day, you suck, you're terrible,

49:46.420 --> 49:47.620
you're a piece of shit.

49:47.620 --> 49:49.620
On the seventh day, nothing.

49:49.620 --> 49:50.500
Nothing.

49:50.500 --> 49:53.220
And then he's back from Monday through Friday.

49:53.220 --> 49:56.820
You have a day of stewing on, I'm a real,

49:56.820 --> 49:57.940
I'm a fucking stinker.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.660
Right, and then he comes back and he's like,

50:00.660 --> 50:02.820
no, don't listen to what that other guy said.

50:02.820 --> 50:04.420
You're great.

50:04.420 --> 50:05.140
But it's the same guy.

50:05.140 --> 50:06.180
Maybe it's a different person.

50:06.180 --> 50:08.500
Maybe it's a different person in the second episode.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.860
Oh, you throw him away.

50:10.580 --> 50:12.420
Yeah, and then the next week it's like,

50:12.420 --> 50:13.540
or maybe, and you know what,

50:13.540 --> 50:15.460
maybe it's just a different hat or like mustache

50:15.460 --> 50:16.740
or whatever, I don't know.

50:16.740 --> 50:18.980
And he's just like, that last guy was a liar.

50:18.980 --> 50:19.620
You're great.

50:20.580 --> 50:25.220
I feel like it would negate when other people

50:25.220 --> 50:27.380
in my life tell me I'm the man.

50:27.940 --> 50:28.980
Oh, I see.

50:28.980 --> 50:31.940
It would be kind of less impactful.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.100
It would take away your ability to appreciate

50:34.100 --> 50:36.660
being the man, you know?

50:37.300 --> 50:39.460
Then how about maybe, let's tweak it a bit.

50:40.580 --> 50:42.900
They're just asking you, are you the man?

50:43.620 --> 50:45.140
And it's up to you to answer.

50:45.140 --> 50:47.140
So it's building your own self-confidence.

50:47.140 --> 50:49.300
And eventually he's going to say,

50:49.300 --> 50:52.260
now you're the man and he'll leave, right?

50:52.260 --> 50:52.740
Forever?

50:53.700 --> 50:54.740
Yeah, you don't need him anymore.

50:54.740 --> 50:57.140
The power's in you because he's asked enough.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.140
He doesn't say you're the man now.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.660
He says, now you're the man.

51:00.660 --> 51:05.380
That keeps us out of finding Forester trademark territory,

51:05.380 --> 51:07.380
which I do appreciate from a legal perspective.

51:07.380 --> 51:09.220
But instead, it's just asking you

51:09.220 --> 51:10.980
until you find the confidence with him

51:10.980 --> 51:13.060
that you don't need him there anymore.

51:14.340 --> 51:16.420
And then he leaves and moves on.

51:16.420 --> 51:19.620
And maybe he just moves on to your next door neighbor.

51:19.620 --> 51:20.660
He doesn't have far to go.

51:20.660 --> 51:21.700
There's only one of him.

51:22.820 --> 51:24.820
And he has to kind of cover the whole world.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.900
So he can really only give you like a week.

51:26.900 --> 51:29.060
So you need to get your shit together.

51:29.060 --> 51:33.300
I do, I mean, we're talking about someone who-

51:33.300 --> 51:35.380
Wait, hey, can we jump back to earlier in the episode

51:35.380 --> 51:37.860
when you were talking about a dog bag full of dookie

51:37.860 --> 51:38.980
and it's Johnny Appleseed

51:38.980 --> 51:40.820
and pretend that I said Johnny Crappleseed?

51:42.180 --> 51:43.140
No, actually.

51:43.140 --> 51:43.780
Fuck, fuck.

51:43.780 --> 51:44.980
Too far away.

51:44.980 --> 51:46.020
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.260
I'm thinking about it.

51:48.260 --> 51:52.020
And like a friend that goes with you everywhere you go,

51:52.020 --> 51:53.860
who's like, you're not the man yet.

51:53.860 --> 51:54.820
You're not the man.

51:54.820 --> 51:55.940
No, you're not the man.

51:55.940 --> 51:58.980
And I do kind of already have that.

52:00.100 --> 52:03.700
But the friend is inside me.

52:04.820 --> 52:06.180
The friend's just my brain.

52:06.820 --> 52:07.320
Yes.

52:08.420 --> 52:10.260
Now see, I have the opposite.

52:10.260 --> 52:12.100
Yeah, you do have this friend.

52:12.100 --> 52:14.180
I don't like how gendered it is though.

52:14.180 --> 52:14.500
Okay.

52:14.500 --> 52:15.780
Yeah, I do.

52:15.780 --> 52:17.860
Maybe if we had a little bit more specific,

52:17.860 --> 52:21.140
like you're the man, which man?

52:22.180 --> 52:23.140
The man with the power.

52:23.140 --> 52:26.020
This is inevitable.

52:26.020 --> 52:28.580
What about just like, you're the best?

52:29.220 --> 52:30.340
No, that's too-

52:30.340 --> 52:32.500
Well, yeah, because man is the best, Travis.

52:32.500 --> 52:35.860
I'm glad we're finally fucking drawing a line in the sand.

52:37.700 --> 52:38.980
You're doctor shit.

52:40.980 --> 52:41.860
Or that something?

52:41.860 --> 52:42.100
Yeah.

52:42.100 --> 52:44.100
Because doctor is gender neutral.

52:44.100 --> 52:46.580
You're the best rapper in the world.

52:46.580 --> 52:47.700
You're doctor cool.

52:47.700 --> 52:54.020
You're the esteemed professor shit with tenure.

52:54.020 --> 52:56.100
You're professor shit emeritus.

52:57.780 --> 53:00.660
I think it would be more useful to me in my day-to-day life

53:00.660 --> 53:02.420
to have someone who follows me around

53:02.420 --> 53:04.340
and tells other people that I'm the man.

53:04.340 --> 53:04.900
Yeah.

53:04.900 --> 53:07.220
Get a load of this guy, he's the man.

53:07.220 --> 53:08.340
This guy's doctor shit.

53:09.220 --> 53:11.300
This guy's doctor shit, look at him.

53:11.300 --> 53:12.260
Fuck yeah, dude.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.460
Hey, are you getting pumped for this guy?

53:15.460 --> 53:17.140
This guy's doctor shit.

53:17.140 --> 53:20.260
He went to shit medical school for seven years for this.

53:20.900 --> 53:25.540
Get out of the way, here comes Judge Cool.

53:27.060 --> 53:29.060
Hey, everyone, it's me, Judge Cool.

53:29.060 --> 53:31.460
I would love to have that in my marriage, just like,

53:31.460 --> 53:33.860
hey, Sydney, are you getting a load of this fucking guy?

53:33.860 --> 53:35.780
Look how much broccoli he's eating.

53:35.780 --> 53:36.980
I'm going wild over here.

53:36.980 --> 53:39.220
I can't believe you're missing this

53:39.220 --> 53:40.580
to pay attention to your kids.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.340
Look at this guy, he's putting it away.

53:42.340 --> 53:43.540
This is the thing, right?

53:43.540 --> 53:47.780
That we're all jealous of 90s hip-hop artists for, right?

53:47.780 --> 53:48.980
The hype man.

53:48.980 --> 53:51.700
None of it, you can't have a hype man in day-to-day life.

53:51.700 --> 53:53.700
I can't be walking around and someone's like,

53:53.700 --> 53:55.540
Travis, rocking them jeans.

53:55.540 --> 53:56.820
Like, I can't do that.

53:56.820 --> 53:59.540
I want that, we all want that.

53:59.540 --> 54:00.420
We all want it.

54:00.420 --> 54:04.020
We all want a hype man whose entire existence

54:04.020 --> 54:08.020
is just about like that they are revolving around us

54:08.020 --> 54:13.300
and they are the more eel to our great white shirt.

54:13.300 --> 54:14.820
We all want that.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.060
A sort of emotional pilot fish, if you will.

54:17.060 --> 54:17.560
Yes.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.180
I'm not sure we all want that.

54:20.180 --> 54:21.940
No, I wicked don't want that.

54:21.940 --> 54:23.460
You don't want a hype person?

54:23.460 --> 54:25.460
I want silence sometimes.

54:26.500 --> 54:28.660
Right now, for instance, is a good time.

54:28.660 --> 54:30.260
Well, I can give that to you, Griffin,

54:30.260 --> 54:32.660
by way of saying that thank you for listening to our podcast,

54:32.660 --> 54:33.620
my brother, my mother and me.

54:33.620 --> 54:34.900
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.660
We are so happy that you made a little time to hang out with us.

54:39.220 --> 54:41.700
It's been a delight, as always.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.700
And thank you.

54:43.700 --> 54:45.540
I was just going to say, you know,

54:46.340 --> 54:48.580
but I'm just going to say get out there and register to vote.

54:48.580 --> 54:49.700
If you're not registered to vote,

54:50.260 --> 54:51.780
get out there and register to vote.

54:51.780 --> 54:56.020
And I'm going to say don't vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

54:56.020 --> 54:57.540
I'm just going to say that to you.

54:57.540 --> 54:59.780
Yeah, that would be actually a very bad thing to do.

54:59.780 --> 55:00.740
And don't do that.

55:00.740 --> 55:01.780
Don't do that.

55:01.780 --> 55:05.940
So register your vote and then maybe use that vote

55:05.940 --> 55:09.460
to oppose the candidate that might actually win again.

55:09.460 --> 55:11.300
Or no, use that vote.

55:11.300 --> 55:11.860
Here he goes.

55:11.860 --> 55:15.380
To vote for the candidate that might actually win against Donald Trump

55:15.380 --> 55:17.780
so that Donald Trump does not continue to be president.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.260
Wow, fit that on a sign, folks.

55:20.260 --> 55:21.220
I'm fucking motivated.

55:21.220 --> 55:24.980
Yeah, so register to vote and use that vote against Donald Trump.

55:26.020 --> 55:28.660
Also, make sure you're signed up for mail-in ballot

55:28.660 --> 55:32.420
because that's going to be the best, safest way to do it this time.

55:32.980 --> 55:35.060
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.060
Thank you also to John Roderick and the Long Winters

55:37.060 --> 55:38.500
for using our theme song, It's a Departure,

55:38.500 --> 55:40.100
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

55:40.100 --> 55:43.140
It shreds, rips, slaps.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.100
It's so fucking good.

55:44.660 --> 55:46.820
And I think that's it.

55:46.820 --> 55:48.260
Y'all want that final?

55:48.260 --> 55:49.060
Oh, oh, oh.

55:49.060 --> 55:49.540
Absolutely.

55:49.540 --> 55:53.220
We wrote a book about podcasting that you can pre-order up beyond January

55:53.220 --> 55:56.980
and go to the macroypodcastingbook.com.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.700
It's called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You.

56:00.820 --> 56:02.260
It's good and you'll enjoy it

56:02.260 --> 56:04.420
and it'll teach you how to make a podcast you're proud of.

56:04.420 --> 56:06.020
It's got jokes and lessons.

56:06.020 --> 56:10.580
This is finally Yahoo sent in by the prospector Merritt Palmer.

56:10.580 --> 56:11.220
Thank you, Merritt.

56:12.740 --> 56:13.940
Diana, who asks,

56:15.380 --> 56:22.180
what is the best vintage children's book about horses that's not well known?

56:27.300 --> 56:28.260
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.540
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:31.460 --> 56:32.820
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

56:32.820 --> 56:33.540
Kiss your dad.

56:33.540 --> 56:43.620
Square on the lips.
