00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better, it's better with you

01:00.220 --> 01:02.220
It's better, it's better with you

01:10.660 --> 01:16.100
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me in an advice show for the modern era

01:16.100 --> 01:18.580
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:18.780 --> 01:24.500
And I'm your middle-est brother big dog woof woof Travis woof woof McElroy woof woof

01:24.500 --> 01:27.260
And this is and this is Griffin

01:28.340 --> 01:33.760
I'm sorry guys. Whoa. Are we just gonna pretend like what happened?

01:34.660 --> 01:37.700
Didn't happen. What in what way Griff? What do you mean?

01:37.700 --> 01:46.340
I'd so we really are doing this then pretending like it didn't happen. What are you talking about though folks?

01:47.180 --> 01:51.120
Moments before we started recording Justin Justin said

01:52.020 --> 01:57.340
Justin said to shut up. He said shut up. I was trying to I was complimenting Griffin on a new wallpaper

01:58.140 --> 02:00.340
Wow, I have a new wallpaper and

02:00.340 --> 02:08.000
And Travis was paying me. What was maybe the first compliment. He's ever given anyone uh-huh and

02:08.880 --> 02:13.760
Well, I give compliments, but they're usually like you have a great brother named Travis shut up Travis shut up for a second

02:13.760 --> 02:17.040
Oh, just fuck shit. Travis. Justin was like shut up

02:18.160 --> 02:19.960
hmm, and it's like

02:19.960 --> 02:26.480
It sucked like it sucked it and put us such a steep. Hey Griffin. Can I talk to Justin for just a second?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.660
I don't remember this. Hey Griffin, could you step over there?

02:31.200 --> 02:34.240
I guess so. Thank you. Hey Justin

02:34.280 --> 02:34.800
Yeah

02:34.800 --> 02:38.420
I was ready to team up with Griffin against you because you said shut up to me

02:38.420 --> 02:41.760
But then Griffin just said shut up to me and it's a much fresher. Was that directed at you?

02:41.760 --> 02:46.480
I actually did not get that sense. Yeah, it was directed at me. So if you if I could just step in here

02:46.480 --> 02:51.840
No, hey, shut up. I'll talk you and me. I thought we were saying shut up. I didn't I know

02:51.840 --> 02:57.640
Um, but that one didn't count that one did not count you and me could team up against Griffin if you want

02:57.640 --> 03:01.980
Oh, that's cool. Yeah, I love that. Yeah. Okay. Well, okay. Hey Griffin, you can come back over

03:02.480 --> 03:05.780
Do do do do do do. Oh fuck. Why'd I walk so far away? Hold on guys

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
Almost there. Okay

03:09.120 --> 03:11.120
Almost there. Whoa, too close

03:11.480 --> 03:18.960
I'll back up and I'm back. What's up guys? Hey, fuck you. No Trav. I don't think so bud. No, that wasn't it

03:18.960 --> 03:24.000
It's not that's actually what you put a little bit too much sauce on it and just if can you actually

03:25.080 --> 03:30.680
Step out. Yeah, I'll step out of the room. No, I'm sorry. I want Travis to step out. I need you Justin. I need you

03:31.760 --> 03:33.200
Yeah, sorry

03:33.200 --> 03:37.240
Just go out on the credenza. You go on the credenza. We'll go on the veranda

03:37.400 --> 03:42.400
Okay, which I actually don't know if a credenza is something you can go. No, it's like a chest or drawers

03:42.400 --> 03:46.280
I'm gonna stand on top of it. All right, you stand on top of that chest of drawers. It's really tall though

03:46.280 --> 03:51.460
I can't hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, did you stand on there now do a fucking flip? Okay

03:52.240 --> 03:54.400
Yeah, baby. Oh cool

03:56.040 --> 04:02.480
Yeah, I've been better than our usual thing why don't we never do stunts that's a good Griffin you do is hey

04:02.480 --> 04:06.040
Could you um, oh, you know what? Can you jump from the couch?

04:06.600 --> 04:11.320
To that big box TV we have and on to the recliner. Um, yeah, hold on

04:12.320 --> 04:14.320
Yeah

04:14.320 --> 04:16.320
Yeah

04:16.680 --> 04:21.560
That was the sound of me doing it I like the part where you bounced off the ceiling like nightcrawler

04:22.360 --> 04:25.440
Thanks. And now Justin eat this whole bicycle. I

04:26.120 --> 04:33.240
Don't tire spokes and all baby pedals that whole kitten caboodle. I'd rather not do that. I'm sorry. Okay

04:33.360 --> 04:36.860
Well, you're out. Okay. Is that okay? No, yes, so

04:37.520 --> 04:39.520
paid for a stunt spectacular

04:39.520 --> 04:44.720
Yeah, I did the thing where I ramped my jet ski through the big ring of fire

04:45.480 --> 04:50.840
Griffin fought that shark and now you need to eat this bicycle. You can eat the bicycle. I'll give you a choice Justin

04:50.840 --> 04:55.440
Okay, eat you can eat the bicycle or catch or catch this bullet

04:56.800 --> 04:58.800
Hmm

04:59.480 --> 05:06.200
Catch the bullet how it went with what body part my stomach do you want me to throw it underhand or overhand?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.760
Oh, well if I'm catching it

05:10.880 --> 05:14.800
Overhand yeah, but not too hard Travis. It is still a bullet. Yeah

05:15.360 --> 05:21.920
I actually got so uncomfortable now that we brought bullets into it. Oh, no, it's just like a nerf. Yeah a nerf dart

05:22.720 --> 05:28.160
We're just having fun in the living room. And I don't even know where one gets a bullet. Yeah, right

05:28.160 --> 05:32.220
It's like a bullet store who's even heard of that? I mean clearly there's a bullet store

05:32.220 --> 05:34.880
But do you walk in and do you are you like let me get um?

05:34.880 --> 05:36.960
five

05:36.960 --> 05:41.800
Five bullets. Is that tell me what kind of bullets I don't know

05:41.960 --> 05:47.080
They they love it at the gun store when you walk in you're like, what's a good number of bullets for a beginner?

05:47.320 --> 05:53.200
Yeah, what's a starter bullet? Like I don't want like don't give me a complicated bullet with a bunch of moving parts

05:53.480 --> 05:57.600
Just give me like a bullet that I can plant in the ground and a gun will grow from you know

05:57.600 --> 06:01.520
And what kind of good are you working with son a nor like a normal size?

06:01.520 --> 06:06.000
Mm-hmm normal size gun. It's kind of like gray, but also kind of black

06:06.920 --> 06:11.400
Give me that. Give me the succulent of bullets, please just something real easy

06:11.400 --> 06:15.440
I want to say it's a club from gold night, but that's probably anything

06:16.080 --> 06:18.080
Right, it's gold

06:18.840 --> 06:24.120
It's a golden gun. I cannot think of a store where I would be more out of my element

06:24.120 --> 06:32.720
Oh asking for things then gun store. Oh, yeah, which is good because I don't need to do that, right? Like I have a demonstration plan

06:32.800 --> 06:38.120
What of your guns can best hold a daisy that I'll slip into the barrel. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that

06:39.120 --> 06:42.120
I um, I cannot imagine

06:42.960 --> 06:45.560
the the only thing you know when like you

06:45.880 --> 06:50.320
Order a fancy bottle of wine because you're trying to feel like a fancy person and then they pour a little bit in a glass

06:50.320 --> 06:52.860
And you're supposed to smell it and you're like, I don't know what the fuck this is

06:52.860 --> 06:59.820
yeah, I would worry about the moment when I was at a gun store and I said like I'll try that gun please and they

06:59.820 --> 07:05.980
Handed it to me and it would go in my hand and I would think what am I supposed to be checking for like?

07:05.980 --> 07:07.740
Yeah, that's a gun

07:07.740 --> 07:08.820
Yeah

07:08.820 --> 07:11.780
Yeah, yeah, I just throw that for sure

07:13.060 --> 07:20.620
Well, this is this one went this one has been a good intro I think yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man

07:20.620 --> 07:22.500
Oh

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
What's wrong juice just all this?

07:27.460 --> 07:31.420
What I'm fine, sorry, I couldn't find the email and I found the email

07:31.420 --> 07:36.860
Oh, I didn't want to derail everything cuz it's like there is a limited number of things you guys can do

07:36.860 --> 07:39.100
I just don't know is this you didn't want to derail it

07:39.100 --> 07:47.260
So you mained maybe one of the worst human noises I've ever heard. I was second-guessing the introduction. It's very visual

07:47.260 --> 07:51.700
Oh, you know, I didn't I didn't even think about that for a podcast

07:52.540 --> 07:56.580
recording for cuz you know, we did the live show it was a smashing success and

07:58.100 --> 08:00.100
But it had a lot of visual elements

08:00.780 --> 08:03.780
Maybe gotten the habit of including visual elements

08:04.060 --> 08:05.060
Yeah, you know

08:05.060 --> 08:11.860
We'll just put the video up for it because I you guys have been like recording your video every time we do a podcast, right?

08:13.020 --> 08:14.700
I've been

08:14.700 --> 08:18.260
Recording a screen share your guys's video. Oh

08:18.820 --> 08:24.240
My god, this is so awkward Griffin. I've been recording a screen share of your guys's video. Whoa

08:24.260 --> 08:27.400
Okay, so that explains the sort of Tesseract

08:27.620 --> 08:33.420
Yeah that we created inside of my Windows operating system and why clip and why Clippy died?

08:34.020 --> 08:39.340
Yeah, man. I miss Clippy funeral for a friend. I miss him so much. Remember when planners killed mr

08:39.340 --> 08:43.540
Peanut they could do that for Clippy and there'd be much rejoicing. I think everybody be excited about that

08:43.540 --> 08:49.420
You bring him in. Well, no, they would never bring him back. That's the thing. He died stay dead. I like mr

08:49.420 --> 08:50.460
They learned their lesson with mr

08:50.460 --> 08:54.540
Peanut when they were like and now he's a baby peanut and now he's back to being normal again. It's like oh

08:55.100 --> 09:00.300
Yeah, this is a trick. The whole thing was a trick get this guys. It was advertising

09:00.660 --> 09:05.180
Yeah, we're just pretending the nuts are still the nuts this time. They'll be like Clippy got very

09:05.820 --> 09:11.220
Clippy got sick and he passed away and he will not be a baby this time. Thank you for watching

09:11.220 --> 09:16.980
Because that's not at company how paperclips work if you want you can kind of bend them into a triangle

09:17.740 --> 09:21.860
And if you arrange it correctly, you know kind of pop up when you drop it on the table

09:22.300 --> 09:30.120
And you want to do that with Clippy's corpse and you can pretend like that's a that's his body still alive and moving around

09:30.260 --> 09:35.140
Crankin doing I mean, that's the good news. Even when Clippy dies. He could still effectively work as a paperclip

09:35.140 --> 09:37.140
Yeah, you can still hold paperclips. Yeah, he doesn't die

09:37.140 --> 09:43.580
He just becomes a less sentient paperclip a better paperclip if you want. He doesn't teach you about headers and footers

09:44.100 --> 09:46.100
but

09:46.340 --> 09:53.180
Documents, yeah. Yeah, yeah for sure. I mean not like a staple a staples way better. I think we all agree

09:53.420 --> 09:58.740
This is the worst introduction we've ever done in the 580. I think we can all agree

09:59.540 --> 10:04.640
Anyone who has not already bought into the franchise in a pretty major way at this point has yeah

10:04.640 --> 10:10.760
Well, every 580 episodes you got to reset back to zero and build up again. We're below that

10:11.320 --> 10:16.840
No, well, we've been we've been absolutely crushing the intros lately. I think is the feedback we always get

10:18.200 --> 10:25.280
So I I think that it's nice for us to just remind people that like what the low at low point looks like

10:25.760 --> 10:30.480
The nadir if you will, and I'm not sure if I've ever said that word correctly

10:30.480 --> 10:37.560
Nadir is the good one, right? Well Zenith is the good Zenith is the good one nadir is the worst one

10:38.040 --> 10:39.980
Yeah, agree to disagree

10:39.980 --> 10:42.440
We've done a lot this show several times this week

10:45.720 --> 10:51.920
We did the show several times in the past week because of scheduling conflicts that are let's be honest our own fault

10:52.240 --> 10:58.920
Yeah, and now we have we have arrived at this point where you were hearing this and we're recording it

10:58.920 --> 11:02.280
And that's all that's promised or intended

11:03.080 --> 11:05.000
This is an advice show

11:05.000 --> 11:11.560
Here's my first piece of advice. If you're doing a comedy podcast, especially during a pandemic where you're maybe

11:12.000 --> 11:18.920
Mental state has been not great as a result of the ongoing unpleasantness. Don't try to do three comedy podcasts in or in one week

11:18.920 --> 11:25.160
Yeah, never recover not to mention several other podcasts several other podcasts now

11:25.160 --> 11:27.640
We are sometimes we try to do funny skits

11:27.640 --> 11:29.040
like

11:29.040 --> 11:34.720
Adventure Zone Adventure Zone is like skit after skit after sketch after skit after sketch

11:34.720 --> 11:39.240
I have a friend who loves Godzilla then why don't they marry him?

11:40.120 --> 11:41.960
Yeah, why don't you marry Godzilla?

11:41.960 --> 11:48.240
I found this great video of the fight between Godzilla and King Kong from Godzilla vs. King Kong. Fuck

11:48.240 --> 11:55.640
Yes, sorry from Godzilla vs. Kong. Yeah, let's let's be specific with our words. I need a hero from Shrek 2. Hell, yeah

11:55.640 --> 11:57.640
Oh wait, is that a special version?

11:58.540 --> 12:00.540
Yeah, wait a minute

12:01.300 --> 12:08.700
Do you think that I need a hero as part of the score of the orchestration of Shrek 2? Okay, wait

12:08.700 --> 12:10.700
No, what? Okay

12:11.020 --> 12:12.380
What?

12:12.380 --> 12:14.380
Who wrote All Star?

12:15.060 --> 12:17.060
Smash that mouth. Oh

12:17.060 --> 12:24.280
Yeah, no, okay to be fair, okay in Shrek

12:24.920 --> 12:30.800
It is sung by the fairy godmother character. So it is a different person singing in for Saunders

12:30.800 --> 12:33.560
Yeah, so if you specifically use that version

12:34.480 --> 12:38.060
Then I understand what you're saying. Okay. Okay. I got I am with you now

12:38.060 --> 12:43.160
Oh PS if I could just take a quick shark related diversion. Yeah, I went over to pick up my daughter

12:43.160 --> 12:47.800
You do not have to ask permission. I don't need permission. I went over to pick up my daughter from

12:48.360 --> 12:50.440
Mimi's house and Mimi said

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
Cooper tell that Cooper's our three-year-old

12:53.880 --> 12:59.320
Mimi said Cooper tell daddy what movie you've been watching today on repeat and she looks me dead in the eyes and goes

12:59.960 --> 13:01.960
some poppy one

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Robo be

13:06.160 --> 13:09.160
Ain't that sharp is to be a bushy. Oh

13:09.160 --> 13:11.160
Oh

13:12.280 --> 13:14.280
It's on

13:14.640 --> 13:20.960
Okay, so I was reading the question. Oh, yeah, the problem is this friend has can't say one other thing real quick

13:23.160 --> 13:25.160
Can call whipped a

13:25.600 --> 13:31.440
Scene from Shrek to whips ass. Yeah, but I want to talk about my thing first. That's that movie whips ass

13:31.600 --> 13:34.480
It's so good. These two big boys are awesome

13:34.480 --> 13:40.040
Individually, oh you get them together you put them together and they cannot I thought

13:40.560 --> 13:44.960
Godzilla was a lady cuz Matthew Broderick said she was having babies. That's

13:46.080 --> 13:47.520
non-canonical

13:47.520 --> 13:48.920
non-canonical

13:48.920 --> 13:50.800
the problem is

13:50.800 --> 13:52.800
Can I talk about the Matthew Broderick?

13:54.280 --> 14:01.280
What's up with that Roland Emmerich produced 2000 Godzilla featuring a soundtrack full of absolute bangers smashers

14:01.280 --> 14:04.480
But I just don't understand Godzilla fit in Madison Square Garden

14:05.480 --> 14:06.920
without

14:06.920 --> 14:13.600
Okay, sorry. Okay. Okay, Travis, please. Let's try to focus. Okay, right, right. You got Ben folds five

14:13.600 --> 14:18.020
Yeah doing air. Yeah, if you ever heard that one. Yeah, there's a

14:18.720 --> 14:21.040
fucking there's that great version of

14:22.240 --> 14:24.240
Kashmir ride with me. Oh, yeah

14:24.240 --> 14:31.520
Oh my god, I believe that's Sean puffy combs. Oh, yeah, and obviously the wallflowers are in this one

14:31.520 --> 14:33.520
Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure, you know what I mean?

14:35.000 --> 14:40.760
Man puff daddy's track is good. Yeah, come with me. That was my first exposure to cashmere

14:40.760 --> 14:46.160
And when I heard cashmere, it's like dang you guys were above that in a major way a huge way

14:46.160 --> 14:52.320
All right, so we're okay now and Hank's areas in a what's the wallflowers? It's the hero

14:52.320 --> 14:54.200
It's just a cover of heroes, isn't it?

14:54.200 --> 14:57.240
All right, most of our audience was not alive when this foot came out

14:57.240 --> 15:00.860
so let's go you remember the huge Taco Bell tie-in with that to or the

15:02.040 --> 15:06.200
Chihuahua like talk to Godzilla and like a scene in a commercial

15:06.600 --> 15:10.920
The problem is that this friend has the same name as my no-nonsense landlord

15:10.920 --> 15:15.500
And when I went to send this amazing video to my friend, I accidentally

15:15.500 --> 15:23.980
Yo, hey, thanks for let me live here you ever sees big boys

15:25.020 --> 15:31.180
Frank Frank Frank Frank Frank check out this video. You know that right? You know my landlord Frank Maraschino

15:31.980 --> 15:35.740
Who is somehow I don't know how you know two people named Frank Maraschino

15:35.740 --> 15:39.020
That seems wild to me, but check out these two big boys

15:39.580 --> 15:43.820
And I know what you're thinking. Oh, this is great. Now when I mute the video, that's right

15:43.820 --> 15:48.620
It's I need a hero from Shrek to not the original version of I need a hero

15:49.220 --> 15:53.900
Why yes, it is. I thought you loved this. Can I get a discount on next month?

15:55.140 --> 15:58.580
Next month is free. You showed me this big lizard fight this huge

16:00.300 --> 16:04.680
You live here for free now, you're my you're my child now

16:06.580 --> 16:12.380
You need me I understand the message I want to finish the question. All right. Yeah, that'd be dope

16:12.380 --> 16:19.000
We've been reading it for like 10 minutes. I accidentally sent to my landlord who is on vacation in Greece even better

16:19.140 --> 16:21.140
That's where God is from

16:21.420 --> 16:23.420
310 in the morning

16:26.140 --> 16:32.020
It's been three days and I've only received the read receipt so I know he saw it my question brothers is

16:32.460 --> 16:36.340
What do I do when my landlord comes home and inevitably asked me about this video next time?

16:36.340 --> 16:42.720
I see him that's from needing a hero in Georgia. You just say pretty good, huh? I

16:46.180 --> 16:52.260
Mean okay, I think you just look at straight in the eyes and there's three reactions like so what do you think?

16:52.260 --> 16:58.660
Yeah, put it back in their court and they say pretty cool. Like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you'd like it pretty bad

16:58.660 --> 17:00.660
Oh, you must not have watched it

17:00.660 --> 17:05.100
Watch it together the time of their lives. Did you watch the whole thing?

17:05.100 --> 17:08.660
Cuz there's twists and turns or I think the most likely thing is very

17:10.460 --> 17:14.300
Grease on vacation for three weeks of one

17:14.460 --> 17:20.060
maybe they don't have maybe they didn't spend the dosh to get like fat pipes and they don't want to

17:20.660 --> 17:26.100
Maybe a series of glossy jpegs that formed together to make a great fight see with the track music

17:26.100 --> 17:31.660
Maybe they don't want to spend their their their gigs their giggle bites to download that

17:31.660 --> 17:33.060
So there's a chance they haven't watched it

17:33.060 --> 17:37.580
But even if they did start booting it up if I see that I'm like listen

17:37.580 --> 17:41.500
This is great, but I really need to be at home to enjoy it. Yeah. Yeah

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
Oh, I need to get in my comfy slippers

17:44.100 --> 17:48.740
Maybe just respond like respond to your own email and say like hey

17:48.740 --> 17:54.860
It's been three days and you still haven't addressed my concerns double down and and when it's like your concerns like yeah

17:54.860 --> 17:56.860
This is a real issue. I'm facing in my apartment

17:57.660 --> 18:03.660
Yeah, I just wanted to say that the reason I sent this to you and the text got cut off. So sorry, but

18:04.500 --> 18:09.860
You in this video. I said you are Kong and my complaints about

18:10.420 --> 18:13.180
Property or Godzilla and every time you're out there

18:13.740 --> 18:15.980
Crushing my complaints and doing battle against it

18:15.980 --> 18:21.540
You're really keeping me satisfied as a tenant and I'm sorry that that text got cut off because without that context is probably very

18:21.540 --> 18:28.380
It probably completely out of nowhere. Sorry about this hero that Shrek required and I thank you for that

18:28.380 --> 18:33.120
You're not the hero. I deserve but you're the hero I need and I can't remember how that quote goes

18:33.380 --> 18:35.820
But thank you so much. How's Greece?

18:37.720 --> 18:41.140
We don't we never talk about personal stuff have you noticed that hey

18:41.140 --> 19:03.500
I hope you have a good time in Greece. Did you have you found out who put the bop in the bop shabop shabop. Now Justin. That's different. Are you proud of yourself. Here's the thing I am. I am. I'm proud of you too. When I thought when I was saying it I thought this is gonna kill. Yeah.

19:03.500 --> 19:11.920
Oh yeah from downtown. Hoop slams another one. He sounds like another word.

19:14.620 --> 19:15.740
Swish

19:15.740 --> 19:22.820
Nothing, but net with rhymes with yet. Which is what we're not done yet. There's so much more comedy to come folks

19:22.820 --> 19:24.820
I know stick around after these vestiges

19:25.580 --> 19:27.580
fucking careening case

19:27.580 --> 19:33.940
For for an entire other 41 minutes. Well friends we're gonna do it and die trying

19:34.860 --> 19:36.340
so

19:36.340 --> 19:38.340
Can we approach the Wizards?

19:38.420 --> 19:45.060
Yeah, I always say throne the wizard would not sit in a throne wizard would sit at the side of the throne

19:46.140 --> 19:48.420
Well, I think maybe hover

19:49.740 --> 19:54.700
Maybe I see so the king sitting on the throne and everybody approaches the king is like my lord

19:54.700 --> 20:02.380
Oh crops, but the king the whole time is like not listening because he's got this wizard hovering like six feet off the ground

20:02.540 --> 20:05.240
Above him. Yeah, and he's like wizard

20:05.940 --> 20:11.060
You're really up staging me a little like I'm the king and I can see right up your robe

20:11.060 --> 20:14.140
Do you I see your dingus and everything?

20:14.140 --> 20:19.780
It's weird that kings would always have a wizard of the court around cuz yeah me

20:19.780 --> 20:25.380
That's the first person I would try to eliminate. Oh really to challenge my power

20:25.940 --> 20:30.300
What like no, no wizard. Look at Cedric right at in Sophia the first

20:30.580 --> 20:37.700
Yes, the the wizard and Sophia the first spins like half that show trying to steal the amulet available now. Hold on Justin

20:37.700 --> 20:41.620
That's only because he thinks that's what he's supposed to do because his mother is an evil wizard

20:41.780 --> 20:44.540
But his father is a good wizard. I'm saying he turns it around

20:44.540 --> 20:48.540
I know Cedric turns it around but like but he doesn't really want it Justin like that's

20:48.540 --> 20:50.540
Uh, he does want it

20:50.700 --> 20:52.880
That's you're talking about an absolute retcon

20:52.880 --> 20:59.580
They realize when they realize like it's wild to have like an insurgent wizard that lives in Sophia's house and is trying to destroy her

20:59.580 --> 21:03.220
They're like, this is a weird feel for a dizzy. He's a grown-ass adult, right?

21:03.220 --> 21:08.060
Yeah, this is a grown adult trying to steal a necklace from a kid. Maybe we should like rethink anyway

21:08.820 --> 21:14.700
You're about to purchase a wizard. Yeah, we need to hey whenever you guys are done. I'm still here

21:14.700 --> 21:20.300
Um, sure. Okay. So, um, this is Stevie sent this in. Thank you so much Stevie. It's

21:20.980 --> 21:24.780
It's written by wikiHow staff. It's under fun activities

21:26.100 --> 21:31.360
Boredom busters. Oh good. Which I have not clicked into that subcategory, but I imagine is a

21:32.180 --> 21:35.840
Vain of content for this show. So I'm gonna bookmark that real quick

21:36.300 --> 21:39.200
How to eat six saltine crackers in one minute

21:39.200 --> 21:45.580
For a fan of crackers eating six saltines might sound like a simple task. However, the saltine challenge is harder than you might think

21:45.800 --> 21:47.540
Yeah, we've all been there

21:47.540 --> 21:54.480
The rules are that a person must completely finish chewing and swallowing six salted saltine crackers in one minute to help without help from liquids

21:54.480 --> 21:56.160
or lubrication

21:56.160 --> 22:02.480
Hey, why did you have to say both of those? Well, could you put some petroleum jelly on the crackers? I

22:03.360 --> 22:06.180
Guess so help them slide down your gullet

22:06.180 --> 22:10.580
If you want to impress your friends or participate in a saltine challenge contest

22:10.580 --> 22:14.540
You may be able to accomplish the task with a little strategy. So we're gonna talk a

22:15.300 --> 22:22.100
Cracker eating strategy. I don't know how I feel about this game fax on the cracker channel. I like if you win this

22:22.700 --> 22:29.960
Based off of knowledge you learned on wikiHow that doesn't feel I don't know it's sporting. Yes. Yes

22:29.960 --> 22:37.560
That's dirty pool. Yeah, I've got cheat codes here. Here's the first cheat code for this to eat six saltines in one minute challenge and

22:37.800 --> 22:41.760
the first one could also be the first step in

22:42.280 --> 22:48.200
Virtually every wikiHow article and it is simply believe in yourself. Hell, yeah

22:48.680 --> 22:54.800
Watch videos of people successfully eating six saltines in under a minute watching videos. Is that does that sound?

22:55.640 --> 22:58.360
That doesn't sound like a lot of saltines does it?

22:58.360 --> 22:59.520
Uh

22:59.520 --> 23:02.880
We just don't use saltines on hands. Well, hold on. No, no, no

23:02.880 --> 23:09.240
We're standing actually at the mouth of a cave and that cave is there's a sign hanging over it

23:09.240 --> 23:12.800
That says the worst audio in the history of our podcast

23:13.360 --> 23:19.120
And we can we can turn it's a tick tock later Justin. It's a tick tock later

23:19.200 --> 23:23.560
That's a tick tock for Justin the supplementary. I want to do that as it takes hot

23:23.560 --> 23:27.480
I don't want to do that permanently just seems like it's not all I'm just I'm not

23:27.480 --> 23:30.120
I'm not in a mood to eat six saltines

23:30.120 --> 23:34.640
I'm just saying that doesn't sound like a lot like if I was enjoying a nice bowl of chili

23:34.920 --> 23:38.120
Yeah, I wouldn't think twice about housing twice that lubrication

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
What way the chili?

23:41.720 --> 23:47.820
That's a non-Newtonian like I'm saying and I wish I could just say it and like you guys don't always have to

23:48.360 --> 23:52.820
Fight everything I say you just be like accepting of the state of my feelings

23:52.820 --> 23:55.100
You know, I mean like I just feel like that's not a lot of saltines

23:55.100 --> 23:58.220
Yes, but not Justin. I understand your feelings in your feelings are valid

23:58.220 --> 24:01.660
But what you're saying is you see you don't have to do that

24:01.660 --> 24:05.500
But you are making a bold claim which I am allowed to refute without tonight

24:05.500 --> 24:10.300
You are you are saying there's no bolt. There's nothing bold about me feeling

24:10.940 --> 24:16.500
Folks, this is important. I'm stopping on this because it's a really important point for you to take away in your day-to-day life

24:17.660 --> 24:23.160
There's nothing bold about me feeling like it's not very many saltines. Okay

24:23.160 --> 24:26.120
Well, not in opposition to that, but just solely as an individual

24:26.860 --> 24:29.380
I feel like it is a lot of saltines

24:30.380 --> 24:32.380
Okay, say shit now

24:32.900 --> 24:39.740
Yeah, Justin, you can't how dare you step to travel? No, I'm accepting. I'm allowed to feel the way I feel Justin feel that way. I

24:40.680 --> 24:42.680
Think that I could definitely eat six

24:43.860 --> 24:47.900
Seconds, that's all I'm saying. Oh god. Let me tell you something as a friend and as a brother

24:47.900 --> 24:52.900
I've gone down not at this exact path Justin

24:53.060 --> 24:58.020
But this is the you are now on the second step to doing this challenge yourself

24:58.020 --> 24:59.460
And if you're not careful

24:59.460 --> 25:05.060
You're gonna you started with that doesn't seem like that much and then the second step is I could totally do that

25:05.580 --> 25:10.220
Right. Yeah, you can see how this is a slippery slope J-man. And do you know what?

25:10.220 --> 25:18.220
I love there's a large portion of our audience that has been listening to our show long enough now that they feel this creeping dread. Oh

25:18.900 --> 25:21.980
They will at some point encounter it it is sir

25:21.980 --> 25:29.060
They are so certain that we have crossed the event horizon of Justin eating six crackers on air that

25:29.900 --> 25:35.560
And they they it's it has filled them with a terror that they cannot like define

25:35.560 --> 25:43.200
I will stand I will stand as a as a bulwark against this act happening on this show as hard as I can

25:43.200 --> 25:47.120
Dear listener, please know I'm on your side. I'm less I listen

25:47.120 --> 25:51.720
I love our listeners, obviously, but I'm more worried about my human brother and his human mouth

25:52.520 --> 25:56.840
Consuming eating six crackers in in a minute

25:57.600 --> 26:04.060
Now really break that down every 10 seconds. That's how many oh my god

26:04.060 --> 26:08.960
You are I think I could definitely do it. Oh fuck. That's that's right. I'm not gonna do it on the podcast

26:08.960 --> 26:12.640
We're gonna hear about some of the tips. This is a good. Yes. Thank you

26:12.640 --> 26:17.960
So Justin just so you can start getting ready. I think maybe the best the best version of this is

26:18.680 --> 26:26.840
You get your crackers together and then we edit out the following 60 seconds of audio and just kind of circle back at the on

26:26.840 --> 26:28.000
the other side

26:28.000 --> 26:30.400
with the driest Justin

26:30.400 --> 26:34.120
That has a very arid Justin

26:35.040 --> 26:38.520
Okay, so first off believe in yourself. Go ahead and start doing that right now

26:39.800 --> 26:43.800
Are you doing that? Yeah, but I believe in myself. Correct. Yes, fantastic

26:44.240 --> 26:46.000
Now that you got your head in the right space

26:46.000 --> 26:47.560
It's time to get your crackers in the right space

26:47.560 --> 26:52.520
Which is to say or arrange them in a way that you everybody thinks about like well

26:52.520 --> 26:56.040
How am I gonna get the lubrication and blah blah blah blah blah. Nobody thinks about

26:57.000 --> 26:58.680
finger technique

26:58.680 --> 27:00.640
nobody thinks about

27:00.640 --> 27:01.680
optimal

27:01.680 --> 27:07.260
Like do you stack them? Do you put them in a row? There's no way you wouldn't do them all at once, right?

27:07.760 --> 27:13.860
Well, hold on have water nearby. I can tell from the Foley work that Justin's already got that covered for sure

27:13.860 --> 27:17.040
Yeah, we're moving on to part two and this is a multi-step

27:17.040 --> 27:21.760
this is a layer that you Justin are gonna have to sort of consult with your

27:22.400 --> 27:27.360
physician and Lord about picking picking a chunking strategy and

27:27.360 --> 27:29.200
I'm sorry

27:29.200 --> 27:37.040
Okay, you're saying do I stack three chunk? Um, do I do two chunk two chunk two or you can be one?

27:37.040 --> 27:38.080
I see you

27:38.080 --> 27:41.840
We skip we can now skip the following two steps

27:41.840 --> 27:47.680
Which is try the three two one strategy or try pairing the crackers for consumption eating two two and two

27:47.880 --> 27:52.480
So Justin's already sort of I'm sort of thinking ahead. Yeah, here's what you do

27:52.480 --> 27:57.600
You shove one towards the back of your mouth and then two on either side one on the top one on the bottom

27:57.600 --> 28:00.520
And then another on the front right the cube strategy, right?

28:00.520 --> 28:04.780
You're gonna do that once fun this nice pocket of air right in the middle that you need to breathe

28:05.280 --> 28:07.860
Yeah, you've got to have the air inside of the cracker cube

28:08.360 --> 28:15.280
And that is gonna be the saltiest most flavorful air the saltiest ever ever have the pleasure of breathing in your life

28:15.280 --> 28:16.880
Oh, baby, is it worth it?

28:16.880 --> 28:19.560
I watched a video of a guy breaking the world record

28:19.560 --> 28:25.400
Which what would you guys guess for one number of crackers in one minute? Yeah, never care carcass in one minute ten eight

28:26.480 --> 28:33.760
Fifteen is the world record and what when he finishes he grabs his shoulder in agony. That doesn't seem right

28:33.760 --> 28:36.180
Does he's having a heart attack from all the goddamn salt?

28:36.900 --> 28:38.900
Why would that hurt your shoulder?

28:39.360 --> 28:41.360
There's a first he does his head

28:41.360 --> 28:49.200
Oh, there's so much we don't know about human physiology that like somebody eats 15

28:49.200 --> 28:53.040
Very salty crackers and it makes her shoulder hurt and doctors are like, I don't know

28:53.560 --> 28:55.560
It seems like that

28:55.680 --> 29:01.280
My favorite part of inner space is Lynn Dennis Clade is going down the trachea and he's like, oh no

29:01.280 --> 29:03.280
I took a wrong turn and I'm in the shoulder

29:03.280 --> 29:10.600
Okay, so the creator is watching his creations from above like well certainly they're not gonna eat more than

29:11.640 --> 29:17.160
Right because there's some we have not tested in front of work. Hey God God before you put humans out

29:17.160 --> 29:23.800
We didn't notice a defect but the good news it will only trigger only this rare bug

29:23.800 --> 29:32.040
It's not even worth patching out which I guess that is a form of patching it out

29:32.040 --> 29:39.640
Yeah, this man dies from his shoulder shoulder his cracker base shoulder injury. I'll put something in the Bible about it. Don't worry. It'll be okay

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Exodus 15 one

29:47.440 --> 29:49.440
Don't do more than

29:49.440 --> 29:56.160
Don't do more than 14 crackers in one minute. Why does it say that? That's like right there in the middle of the whole Passover story

29:56.920 --> 30:01.760
Okay, so you can try eating all six crackers at once also that is and that is another seems like that

30:01.760 --> 30:05.040
Say that to me that one smells like that stinks of failure

30:05.040 --> 30:05.280
Yeah

30:05.280 --> 30:11.200
That I feel that feels like a knee-jerk like first-timer mistake like let's get them all out of the way. I'm like, no

30:11.200 --> 30:14.680
No, I mean, I don't know. Oh

30:14.680 --> 30:20.880
Ooh, here's a cheat code. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Hey, hey, hey everybody lean in

30:21.400 --> 30:25.040
Bet your friends that you can do this, right? We're gonna hustle. We're gonna make some money out of this

30:25.040 --> 30:31.960
It's a grift but before this ever starts 24 hours before you're gonna set up like seven humidifiers in this room

30:32.160 --> 30:34.920
You're gonna get that air so wicked moist

30:35.560 --> 30:36.880
Right. Oh

30:36.880 --> 30:45.880
So moist environment. Oh, yeah, you do this in the fucking rainforest cafe, which I assume is very moist. Why do you think that's a moist building?

30:45.880 --> 30:49.600
Cuz it's called the rainforest cafe Griffin think they keep it arid

30:49.600 --> 30:52.240
I mean you can do it in the rainforest

30:52.240 --> 30:58.440
But you're gonna lose a lot of money that you're gonna win just on travel alone and getting a guide and supplies and stuff

30:59.080 --> 31:03.320
It's expensive to go to this way too expensive to go to the rainforest these days. Yeah

31:03.320 --> 31:10.080
So the next thing that you need to know about is practice before the challenge which Justin you can skip that step

31:10.080 --> 31:15.840
You're gonna be fine. You've had crackers before right? You've eaten crackers. I've done plenty of cracker practice

31:15.840 --> 31:18.960
Okay, or crack this as we call it. No one

31:19.760 --> 31:27.500
Did call it that. Oh, so you're not in. Okay. I thought I just thought you were in, you know, the circle this next one's dope

31:28.640 --> 31:30.640
Keep your cool

31:30.640 --> 31:36.000
If you get over excited or nervous you may breathe in the crumbs and you're rushed to stuff the crackers in your mouth and you

31:36.000 --> 31:41.280
Won't be able to finish in time. Yeah, avoid shoving the crackers in your mouth as you could jab the back of your throat or poke

31:41.280 --> 31:45.760
Your gums. Hey pain is weakness leaving the body two rules. Don't huff don't stuff

31:46.520 --> 31:49.320
Don't huff or stuff. Thank you Travis again

31:50.240 --> 31:52.600
Great great advice from the cracker King himself

31:53.360 --> 31:58.280
This is where the truth comes out Justin. I'm sorry. I fought you earlier, but I was in the circuit back in the day

31:58.280 --> 32:01.400
And I thought you're gonna say the circus. I was in the circus

32:02.040 --> 32:07.840
That'd be and they fed us in crackers. Come see the incredible cracker eating boy. Not again, please

32:07.840 --> 32:12.400
I just want to go to college eat more crackers. This is all you'll ever be good for

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
Why did I ever get this magic feather?

32:18.440 --> 32:22.520
So he's like wandering by they're like so Darlene what was three times

32:22.520 --> 32:29.280
348 and tribes like 1200. It's like he's amazing. He knows the answer to math. He can do math

32:29.280 --> 32:31.440
I told you cracker boy can't be taught

32:32.120 --> 32:34.120
No, believe me

32:34.120 --> 32:41.720
I'm gonna find some way to distribute the image that accompany the keep your cool tip because it's just a boy giving like a

32:45.480 --> 32:47.480
What this is a tattoo

32:47.480 --> 32:52.280
Whereas the boy the boy is holding some five crackers which drives me up

32:57.560 --> 32:59.560
It's a good image, yeah

33:05.160 --> 33:10.940
Yeah, sure and the last the last tip is to just go for it so just go for everything you need

33:10.940 --> 33:16.280
Well, oh the reason he's holding five crackers is what is already in his mouth. Oh, I see I see

33:16.280 --> 33:21.600
I see so fucking chill. You can't even tell he's very relaxed some community Q&A real quick

33:21.600 --> 33:23.600
How dry will my mouth be when I finish?

33:23.960 --> 33:27.880
Extremely, you know, can I impress someone by eating six saltine crackers in a minute?

33:27.880 --> 33:32.480
Maybe depends on the person on the person more than anything really? Yeah

33:33.800 --> 33:39.040
Why are saltine crackers made to soak saliva and be dry? That's a fucked up way of thinking about

33:39.440 --> 33:42.520
yeah, I think saltine crackers are made to be crunchy and

33:43.600 --> 33:45.320
delicious little

33:45.320 --> 33:50.520
Couture malt for a chili. I don't think of them as mouth mouth towels

33:51.200 --> 33:55.040
Well, they are they're sorry. Yeah, I mean you're gonna use them in soup and chili. They're absorbent

33:55.520 --> 34:01.160
They're absorbent, but I don't think of them as that. I don't slight them for that. Like that's a feature not a bug

34:01.160 --> 34:03.160
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

34:03.400 --> 34:08.180
Like you wouldn't be like, oh man, this ShamWow picked up all my water. You'd be excited

34:09.060 --> 34:11.060
exactly

34:11.060 --> 34:15.400
So juice you ready? Yep. Okay. Oh

34:16.420 --> 34:21.260
You want me to actually do this or we can make pretend like a minute has passed and you did it

34:21.500 --> 34:25.740
Well, can you guys wait 30 seconds? See if I have saltines? Yep, I guess so

34:28.420 --> 34:31.140
How are you Griffin me? Yeah

34:31.940 --> 34:34.180
Pretty good. Okay. Awesome, man

34:34.820 --> 34:40.280
Well, I didn't have me saltines. Fuck. All right. I got two I got two Ritz got two Ritz

34:40.280 --> 34:46.360
Okay, here's what we'll do. Yeah, we'll subdivide juice you eat those two Ritz in of in eight seconds

34:46.980 --> 34:51.380
Ready set go. Well, I can hear you eating it right now. He didn't even get it. They weren't for the oh

34:52.060 --> 34:55.240
They weren't so wait, hold on. Wait juice. You only have one Ritz now

34:57.900 --> 35:01.060
Juice you gotta eat one Ritz in three seconds. I

35:02.260 --> 35:06.220
Just tell me when you're ready. Tell me when you're ready. This is gonna be fucking funny. Tell me when you're ready

35:06.220 --> 35:09.840
Okay, three two one go

35:12.620 --> 35:14.620
1003 did you finish? Ah

35:16.420 --> 35:22.140
So not so easy is it not so easy is it eating six saltines no, but I did it in less than ten seconds

35:25.220 --> 35:28.660
You know that they don't have corners go to Wendy's

35:29.260 --> 35:34.500
Why would you there's other places to get saltines Justin they sell go to Dollar General right now

35:34.500 --> 35:36.800
Why are you getting crackers in weird places?

35:37.260 --> 35:41.960
Why are you getting mad dollar general is close that that was just close and that's good

35:41.960 --> 35:46.180
If you don't want to pay full price for you know, I'm sorry Justin

35:46.180 --> 35:51.340
I think you need to get the name brand so that we can like make this a repeatable. It's name brand. It's just like

35:52.100 --> 35:56.140
The expiration dates are all smudged a little bit. Oh, so there's even drier

35:57.540 --> 36:01.660
Intellectual case for or not or they could be wetter. I don't know how yeah

36:01.660 --> 36:06.060
That's true. What they're so absorbent. This is Justin sequel to cool hand Luke

36:09.660 --> 36:13.060
Luke was like I can eat a thousand eggs in five seconds

36:16.660 --> 36:21.700
You can't do this cool hand Luke no no no time you guys no no stop. What are you doing?

36:21.700 --> 36:27.980
I'm right. I missed I skipped breakfast this morning. I'm wicked hungry. I can eat 1000 eggs in four seconds

36:27.980 --> 36:32.380
Oh, it's like it's like hyperbole. We're like, you know, get me

36:33.140 --> 36:35.860
Where are we supposed to get a thousand eggs? We're in prison

36:36.460 --> 36:42.940
Okay, this is gonna give us eggs you think that we go into the prison kitchen and say give us a thousand eggs

36:42.940 --> 36:46.380
They will be like, yep, seems fine. Nothing weird here. Come on

36:46.540 --> 36:52.340
This isn't for like an escape attempt thing. Is it no my man cool hand Luke is gonna eat a thousand in four seconds

36:52.340 --> 36:59.580
Three seconds, holy shit, that's less than you started. This is right. This is where I had care for the baby

36:59.580 --> 37:01.260
They're filming the movie cool cool

37:01.260 --> 37:08.340
Hey Luke, and then everyone's just kind of standing around on a break and Paul Newman goes the director. He's like, hmm

37:11.700 --> 37:15.660
You know how you said you were looking for that kind of like cornerstone scene, you know

37:15.660 --> 37:18.780
You want um, I thought one scene for the boot now Paul

37:18.780 --> 37:21.940
Are you gonna suggest eating much eggs again?

37:24.580 --> 37:27.740
Okay, all right, I'm listening I'm listening it's a lot of eggs

37:28.780 --> 37:30.780
Like wait, no, no, no

37:33.060 --> 37:35.060
It's like a bet

37:35.260 --> 37:40.580
It's like a bet they have to dare me to do it. Yeah Paul you eat 50 eggs every morning

37:40.580 --> 37:45.060
No one dares you do it. It's like I think it'd be cool to put in the movie people want to see this

37:45.060 --> 37:49.860
It'd be a cool scene to put in a movie is we eating 50 eggs. No one's ever done it

37:50.220 --> 37:56.060
We haven't introduced the idea that your character especially likes it and it doesn't come back in the script

37:56.060 --> 37:58.580
Well, it doesn't come back. It's not like later though

37:58.580 --> 38:02.380
There's a wall made of eggs and only one man can eat them out of the prison, right?

38:02.820 --> 38:08.560
Though hey, it's not too late for that director Paul. It's part of the traditional hero's journey

38:09.120 --> 38:14.140
You leave your home you grow you eat a thousand eggs in two seconds

38:14.140 --> 38:17.980
Mm-hmm, and then you come back home and everything's different and you're a man

38:17.980 --> 38:22.140
We did we go to the money zone because it feels like this is the money zone

38:22.140 --> 38:24.720

38:25.300 --> 38:27.300

50 hard-boiled eggs. No, no, is this food or art? Both. Okay, fantastic. Alright. Oh my god. I didn't think 50 hard-boiled eggs was gonna be that bad. I mean I knew it was gonna be bad. The density of them compared to just making a scrambled egg is a big difference. Daddy, look. Ah, cool.

44:57.180 --> 45:24.180
I'm sorry. Yeah, he did it in front of his two kids. Did he say there's a big difference between eating a scrambled egg and eating 50 hard-boiled eggs? The density, Travis. The density of the hard-boiled egg, yeah. This video has 757 views. It's about to have a bunch more, I bet. Yeah, shout out.

46:24.180 --> 46:45.180
Yeah. The McRib, a lot of people don't like to talk about it, so I will. Thank you, Justin. You're so brave. Yeah, it's really brave of me to say that. Do you all realize that they shape it to look like it's got bones? Yeah, definitely. And then you eat the bones? You think about that? Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

46:45.180 --> 47:04.180

You know what? Apoyo Loco, I haven't double checked that, but I will. I'm just the sort of person that has the amount of free time requisite to double check that. And you know that I will. And they're bringing it back.

48:02.180 --> 48:10.180
We're thrilled to be bringing back this much loved classic just in time for National Taco Day. And we're excited to continue our digital evolution.

48:10.180 --> 48:24.180
That's right. Apoyo Loco is becoming a sentient cyber restaurant with this rollout as the very first Apoyo Loco menu item that can only be purchased online or through the app.

48:24.180 --> 48:30.180
You cannot go to Apoyo Loco and order this.

48:30.180 --> 48:40.180
That is, listen, I know that I have a theater degree. I make podcasts. I'm not a business boy. I know this.

48:40.180 --> 48:47.180
But what is the business strategy here that says like we make it less available?

48:47.180 --> 48:49.180
I don't understand the strategy.

48:49.180 --> 48:58.180
But it's the exact same thing that they've been doing with like, it's the same thing as the McRib. It makes it seem scarce and exciting.

48:58.180 --> 49:03.180
But it's not scarce. Like the McRib is like, don't miss your chance to get this.

49:03.180 --> 49:10.180
This is like saying like, oh, I came in to get it. I didn't want to miss my chance. Well, it's not here. It's in your phone.

49:10.180 --> 49:12.180
You gotta cyber it.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.180
You gotta cyber order it.

49:14.180 --> 49:28.180
So I searched Twitter for mentions of Apoyo Loco and to see what people are saying about it. Like they're being like really demanding about it.

49:28.180 --> 49:35.180
Marianne says, Carlinch, Carlinch, do you hear that sound? Apoyo Loco is the glorious crunchy taco noise.

49:35.180 --> 49:39.180
Hashtag bring back crunchy tacos. That's from September 14th.

49:39.180 --> 49:41.180
Okay.

49:41.180 --> 49:43.180
June 21st.

49:43.180 --> 49:48.180
Apoyo Loco, bring back my damn crunchy taco, please.

49:48.180 --> 49:53.180
That was a wide, so there's just those two people then that want this?

49:53.180 --> 49:55.180
January 3rd.

49:55.180 --> 49:57.180
That's a pretty big span.

49:57.180 --> 49:59.180
We've heard you. We've heard you.

49:59.180 --> 50:01.180
Whoa, whoa, stop yelling.

50:01.180 --> 50:03.180
Shut up everyone. We get it.

50:03.180 --> 50:05.180
We get it.

50:05.180 --> 50:10.180
Bring back your crunchy chicken tacos already, please. I want to give you all my money again.

50:10.180 --> 50:13.180
Hi, police. I'd like to follow a harassment report.

50:13.180 --> 50:19.180
People will not stop about these tacos. And it's like, I'm just trying to live my life.

50:19.180 --> 50:25.180
Before that, it was one in December and November and September.

50:25.180 --> 50:27.180
And that's...

50:27.180 --> 50:29.180
Yep.

50:29.180 --> 50:31.180
July.

50:31.180 --> 50:35.180
July 22. There have been eight tweets about this in the past 18 months.

50:35.180 --> 50:37.180
No one cares.

50:37.180 --> 50:39.180
No one gives a shit.

50:39.180 --> 50:41.180
People care a lot.

50:41.180 --> 50:47.180
What we should do is tweet at Apoyo Loco and ask them, please don't bring back the crunchy chicken taco.

50:47.180 --> 50:49.180
Ask them to bring back the McPizza.

50:49.180 --> 50:51.180
Okay.

50:51.180 --> 50:54.180
That's what outrage looks like.

50:54.180 --> 50:58.180
Say, hey Apoyo Loco, McDonald's isn't doing anything with it.

50:58.180 --> 51:00.180
Can you bring back the McPizza?

51:00.180 --> 51:02.180
Can you bring back the McPizza?

51:02.180 --> 51:05.180
Will you please invent an incredibly soft taco?

51:05.180 --> 51:07.180
So soft.

51:07.180 --> 51:10.180
A non-Newtonian taco.

51:10.180 --> 51:13.180
That's my second time using that phrase this episode.

51:13.180 --> 51:15.180
Good job, Travis.

51:15.180 --> 51:17.180
Do we want to do one more question?

51:17.180 --> 51:19.180
I'd love that.

51:19.180 --> 51:22.180
I recently got promoted at work and I'm starting to work as a cheese monger.

51:22.180 --> 51:25.180
Which is very exciting because I love cheese.

51:25.180 --> 51:27.180
Better than the alternative.

51:27.180 --> 51:29.180
There's only two things you can really monger.

51:29.180 --> 51:31.180
Cheese and beer.

51:31.180 --> 51:32.180
Yeah.

51:32.180 --> 51:34.180
It's true.

51:34.180 --> 51:39.180
I had an old cowbell on a shelf in the cheese department known as Cheesetown.

51:39.180 --> 51:44.180
And old cheese mongers used to ring it when they managed to cut a perfect increment of cheese for a customer.

51:44.180 --> 51:45.180
I remember that.

51:45.180 --> 51:46.180
Half pound, fourth pound.

51:46.180 --> 51:47.180
I love this.

51:47.180 --> 51:48.180
That's so good.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.180
I love it.

51:49.180 --> 51:50.180
I used to do that shit at TCBY.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.180
Did you?

51:51.180 --> 51:52.180
Yeah.

51:52.180 --> 51:59.180
If we could get a perfect seven-ouncer on a small or I forget the exact sizes, but there wasn't a bell, but I would treat myself to just a fistful of-

51:59.180 --> 52:00.180
A small?

52:00.180 --> 52:03.180
A small was nearly a half pound of yogurt?

52:03.180 --> 52:04.180
Yeah, I guess so.

52:04.180 --> 52:06.180
Damn, Griff.

52:06.180 --> 52:08.180
The country's most generous yogurt were like-

52:08.180 --> 52:09.180
Yeah.

52:09.180 --> 52:12.180
Hey, you know I didn't set that.

52:12.180 --> 52:16.180
I wasn't making TCBY policy decisions, juicer.

52:16.180 --> 52:21.180
I'm just saying that TCBY is now a nail salon and maybe there's something to that.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.180
Maybe they were a little too generous.

52:22.180 --> 52:26.180
They're a bourbon through the profits.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.180
Wait, Griffin.

52:27.180 --> 52:32.180
Griffin, you haven't been doing seven ounces at a small, have you?

52:32.180 --> 52:37.180
Nobody really uses it anymore, but I want to bring it back so I can ring the cheese bell.

52:37.180 --> 52:39.180
Sorry, so I can ring the cheese bell.

52:39.180 --> 52:41.180
How do I smoothly bring it back?

52:41.180 --> 52:42.180
That's from Haley.

52:42.180 --> 52:47.180
You can't smoothly bring back a bell practice.

52:47.180 --> 52:48.180
You just do it.

52:48.180 --> 52:50.180
You do it, and it's loud.

52:50.180 --> 52:53.180
Everyone, if you're listening to this, stop it.

52:53.180 --> 52:56.180
I'm going to make this a year theme soon if we can shoehorn it in.

52:56.180 --> 52:59.180
Stop waiting for permission.

52:59.180 --> 53:02.180
No one ever got permission to do something interesting.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.180
Just do it.

53:03.180 --> 53:07.180
Well, that's not, I would say, a catch-all tagline.

53:07.180 --> 53:15.180
No, obviously not, but like, okay, let me rephrase that in a way that's more of a blanket statement.

53:15.180 --> 53:18.180
No one will ask you to innovate.

53:18.180 --> 53:19.180
How's that?

53:19.180 --> 53:21.180
No one will request you.

53:21.180 --> 53:23.180
No one's going to ask you to innovate.

53:23.180 --> 53:25.180
If they thought of it, they would have done it.

53:25.180 --> 53:27.180
You've got the bell.

53:27.180 --> 53:28.180
Look in your hand.

53:28.180 --> 53:30.180
There's a bell ringer.

53:30.180 --> 53:37.180
That is so in line with what I was going to say, which my advice is, ring it, right?

53:37.180 --> 53:39.180
And then someone says, what are you doing?

53:39.180 --> 53:45.180
Just don't, no couching, just say, that's what you do when you cut a perfect increment.

53:45.180 --> 53:49.180
Not, I thought we could start doing this, or that's what they used to do.

53:49.180 --> 53:50.180
Just statement of fact.

53:50.180 --> 53:51.180
This is what's done.

53:51.180 --> 53:53.180
This is what you do, right?

53:53.180 --> 53:54.180
This is how it's done.

53:54.180 --> 53:56.180
And maybe they've worked there longer than you, or they're new.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.180
It doesn't matter.

53:57.180 --> 54:02.180
If you make it a statement of fact, this is what you do when you do this.

54:02.180 --> 54:03.180
We've always done this.

54:03.180 --> 54:06.180
Then they will be like, oh, I didn't know that.

54:06.180 --> 54:10.180
That's the only response to that kind of confidence.

54:10.180 --> 54:15.180
Yeah, it was just, okay, listen, the alternative is you just got a bell.

54:15.180 --> 54:17.180
Why do we have a bell here, Todd?

54:17.180 --> 54:20.180
If we're not supposed to be ringing it when we cut a perfect increment.

54:20.180 --> 54:25.180
I will say, along these same lines, one time I was at a Trader Joseph's,

54:25.180 --> 54:28.180
and there's a bell there hanging next to the checkout.

54:28.180 --> 54:32.180
And I mistakenly believe that one rings that bell when it's like,

54:32.180 --> 54:34.180
hey, I got good service and I want everyone to know.

54:34.180 --> 54:35.180
And it is not.

54:35.180 --> 54:36.180
You what?

54:36.180 --> 54:39.180
You ring the bell when you need help with a checkout

54:39.180 --> 54:42.180
or when they need some people working there.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.180
I did not know that.

54:43.180 --> 54:44.180
I thought it was like that.

54:44.180 --> 54:46.180
You thought it was for customers to be like,

54:46.180 --> 54:49.180
great job, Trader Joe's, ring a ding, ding, ding.

54:49.180 --> 54:50.180
Yeah.

54:50.180 --> 54:53.180
Now, Griffin, you think that's wild because you know the truth, right?

54:53.180 --> 54:54.180
Right.

54:54.180 --> 54:58.180
But if you didn't know that it was for employees to use,

54:58.180 --> 55:03.180
and there's a bell hanging there within arm's reach of the general public.

55:03.180 --> 55:04.180
Yeah.

55:04.180 --> 55:08.180
Wouldn't you think like, this must be for me because this can't be the system

55:08.180 --> 55:13.180
they use to contact one another in the year 2021.

55:13.180 --> 55:16.180
Right. They're not sailors on an old ship.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.180
This is what I'm saying.

55:17.180 --> 55:19.180
This can't be the most effective means.

55:19.180 --> 55:23.180
When I've been in other grocery stores where they can get on a microphone

55:23.180 --> 55:27.180
and say, hey, Todd, come help me bag.

55:27.180 --> 55:28.180
Yeah.

55:28.180 --> 55:29.180
Right?

55:29.180 --> 55:32.180
So the bell must be there for fun.

55:32.180 --> 55:34.180
For my enjoyment.

55:34.180 --> 55:35.180
This is what I'm saying.

55:35.180 --> 55:37.180
The bell can't be there for, oh, I'm sorry.

55:37.180 --> 55:39.180
I didn't realize this is a work bell.

55:39.180 --> 55:40.180
Yeah.

55:40.180 --> 55:41.180
Business bell.

55:41.180 --> 55:42.180
Yeah.

55:42.180 --> 55:43.180
Good point, Trav.

55:43.180 --> 55:44.180
Thank you.

55:44.180 --> 55:46.180
I just don't want tweets.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.180
I bet that momentum's back.

55:47.180 --> 55:49.180
Oh, hell yeah, man.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.180
Fuck yeah.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.180
With carnage and shit.

55:51.180 --> 55:52.180
Yeah.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.180
With carnage.

55:53.180 --> 55:55.180
I hope Spider-Man's in this one.

55:55.180 --> 55:58.180
Why did we go there?

55:58.180 --> 56:02.180
I just wanted to mention, I don't think we'll get a chance to do a watch for it

56:02.180 --> 56:04.180
because I didn't get a chance to do a watch with the first one.

56:04.180 --> 56:06.180
I guess it is pretty cool that he's back.

56:06.180 --> 56:07.180
Yeah.

56:07.180 --> 56:08.180
I just think it's cool that Venom's back.

56:08.180 --> 56:12.180
And I saw in the trailer this time, speaking of eggs, there's Venom making breakfast.

56:12.180 --> 56:13.180
That's great.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.180
Venom makes breakfast in this one?

56:14.180 --> 56:15.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:15.180 --> 56:17.180
He's a mass murderer, but he makes a fun breakfast.

56:17.180 --> 56:18.180
Cool.

56:18.180 --> 56:19.180
So that's our show.

56:19.180 --> 56:21.180
Thank you all so much for listening to it.

56:21.180 --> 56:24.180
We talked a lot about Venom and eggs today.

56:24.180 --> 56:28.180
We always tell people when they ask, where should I start with My Brother, My Brother,

56:28.180 --> 56:29.180
and Me?

56:29.180 --> 56:33.180
And after this, I've always said, just start with the newest one.

56:33.180 --> 56:36.180
And after recording this episode, I have two new answers.

56:36.180 --> 56:38.180
The first one is, maybe don't.

56:38.180 --> 56:43.180
The second one is, just pick one other than this one.

56:43.180 --> 56:47.180
Have you checked out 579 or 581?

56:47.180 --> 56:49.180
Those are two really good ones.

56:49.180 --> 56:53.180
I'm going to need a great place to start.

56:53.180 --> 56:58.180
Hey, speaking of great things, big exciting news.

56:58.180 --> 57:04.180
November 5th, remember, remember, 9 PM Eastern time, we're doing a live and virtual Adventure

57:04.180 --> 57:05.180
Zone show.

57:05.180 --> 57:06.180
Whoa.

57:06.180 --> 57:13.180
It's going to be the third installment in Adventure Zone Hootenanny, which we have done

57:13.180 --> 57:16.180
before with Lasers and Feelings, created by John Harper.

57:16.180 --> 57:19.180
So that is an absolute blast.

57:19.180 --> 57:21.180
If you haven't checked those shows out before, don't you worry.

57:21.180 --> 57:26.180
We're going to do a little like previously on, so you can come to it brand new.

57:26.180 --> 57:29.180
It's not the richest narrative tapestry.

57:29.180 --> 57:30.180
It'll probably be okay.

57:30.180 --> 57:32.180
You're not going to be too far behind.

57:32.180 --> 57:35.180
It's a futuristic country band in space.

57:35.180 --> 57:36.180
Don't you worry about it.

57:36.180 --> 57:38.180
Tickets are just $10.

57:38.180 --> 57:41.180
You can get those at bit.ly slash Taz virtual.

57:41.180 --> 57:45.180
And video on demand will be available for two weeks after the show, if you can't make

57:45.180 --> 57:48.180
it to November 5th at 9 PM Eastern time, but go get those tickets now.

57:48.180 --> 57:49.180
I know what you're wondering.

57:49.180 --> 57:54.180
Will it be important for you to be very familiar with the first two in order to enjoy the third

57:54.180 --> 57:55.180
one?

57:55.180 --> 57:58.180
And let me say as somebody who's going to be recording the third one, I certainly hope

57:58.180 --> 57:59.180
not.

57:59.180 --> 58:00.180
Thanks.

58:00.180 --> 58:01.180
Did you thank Montaigne?

58:01.180 --> 58:02.180
No.

58:02.180 --> 58:03.180
You want to do it this time?

58:03.180 --> 58:04.180
No, I'd rather you did.

58:04.180 --> 58:06.180
Hey, thanks to Montaigne for the use of our theme song, My Life.

58:06.180 --> 58:07.180
Because that's the way it's done.

58:07.180 --> 58:08.180
Better with you.

58:08.180 --> 58:12.180
It's a great track with a fun video and a great catchy beat and a rhythm that you can

58:12.180 --> 58:15.180
really bop your booty to.

58:15.180 --> 58:19.180
So that felt just awful saying that.

58:19.180 --> 58:21.180
Oh, also, wait, hold on.

58:21.180 --> 58:22.180
We got new merch.

58:22.180 --> 58:24.180
We got a new month started.

58:24.180 --> 58:27.180
We got Adventure Zone notebooks, Candlelight's wrapping paper.

58:27.180 --> 58:29.180
We got a new pin of the month.

58:29.180 --> 58:36.180
It is Hellraven, a.k.a. secret identity, Del Craven from, I believe, Just Us?

58:36.180 --> 58:37.180
The Adventure Zone live shows?

58:37.180 --> 58:38.180
Yes, just us.

58:38.180 --> 58:39.180
Yes.

58:39.180 --> 58:40.180
And that benefits-

58:40.180 --> 58:45.180
It's looking incredibly intense in feathered garb.

58:45.180 --> 58:49.180
The proceeds from that benefit the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice,

58:49.180 --> 58:54.180
which builds Latina and Latinx power to fight for the fundamental human right to reproductive

58:54.180 --> 58:56.180
health, dignity, and justice.

58:56.180 --> 58:59.180
So make sure you check those out.

58:59.180 --> 59:04.180
Also, in case you missed the news, Adventure Zone is now weekly, which is very exciting.

59:04.180 --> 59:10.180
If you are a fan of the Great British Bake Off, mine and Teresa's Bake Off watch-along

59:10.180 --> 59:17.180
show, Bake On, is back and available in Podcatchers.

59:17.180 --> 59:19.180
And yeah, that's it.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.180
That's it.

59:20.180 --> 59:22.180
Hey, here's the final Yahoo.

59:22.180 --> 59:29.180
This one was sent in by the Tumblin Mold Man.

59:29.180 --> 59:30.180
Oh, boy.

59:30.180 --> 59:32.180
Yeah, this one was sent in by the Tumblin Mold Man.

59:32.180 --> 59:34.180
Haven't heard from him in a while.

59:34.180 --> 59:41.180
Yeah, he's like a cool dude who is like really yucky, but in like a cool, transgressive way.

59:41.180 --> 59:42.180
Yeah.

59:42.180 --> 59:43.180
Got it.

59:43.180 --> 59:48.180
Like he comes to town and you might be uncomfortable at first, but then when the zombies attack

59:48.180 --> 59:50.180
or whatever, you're glad he's there.

59:50.180 --> 59:53.180
You're glad that you can find the yucky mold man.

59:53.180 --> 59:57.180
Because at first you think maybe he's causing the sickness because he's the yucky mold man,

59:57.180 --> 59:58.180
right?

59:58.180 --> 59:59.180
But no, no, no.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.180
He just knows how to stop it.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.180
And that's how he got that name.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.180
Yeah.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:09.180
And it's asked by the prince, the current prince, one of the princes.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.180
Uh-huh.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.180
One of the two princes.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.180
Yeah.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.180
Who asks...

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.180
Come on.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.180
What's it say, Griffin?

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.180
Just say it.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.180
Just read it.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.180
The prince asks...

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.180
Are you nervous?

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:29.180
I don't think I'm going to actually be able to get one out this time.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:35.180
Is that what the prince said?

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.180
Yeah.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180
The prince says...

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.180
The prince said I don't actually think I'll be able to get one out this time?

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.180
The prince says...

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.180
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.180
What category is that in, Griffin?

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.180
Okay.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:48.180
To be clear, Griffin McElroy, a brother, is not saying that he can't get one out this

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.180
time.

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:52.180
Griffin found this funny Yahoo answers request where someone...

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.180
Where the prince...

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.180
You know what I mean?

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.180
The prince said...

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.980
The prince asks, would you be mad if I couldn't get one out this time?

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.820
And I do need to know the category that was listed under Griffin.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:15.380
That was listed under fun and games, subcategory religion.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.740
This was recorded on International Podcast Day.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.740
No.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.740
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.740
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.740
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.100
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.740
Happy International Podcast Day.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:55.340
Kiss your dad's grown lips.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:02:05.140
Kiss your dad's grown lips.
