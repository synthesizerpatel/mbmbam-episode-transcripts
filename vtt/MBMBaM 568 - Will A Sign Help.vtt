00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:10.820 --> 01:15.740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me and advice show for the modern era

01:15.740 --> 01:20.120
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother big dog

01:21.140 --> 01:28.740
Travis McElroy and I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy, you know here at my brother

01:28.740 --> 01:33.860
My brother and me industries. Yeah, the word of the day the word of the year the word of the business is of course

01:34.660 --> 01:38.880
Innovation we're always looking for new ways to help you the listener

01:38.880 --> 01:46.200
Slash consumer and for a while there it was get you said at the beginning of the year. It was skin ovation and me

01:46.560 --> 01:50.820
innovation and just like what's that and you were like poly weave fibers

01:51.680 --> 01:57.920
Nano fiber weave on your skin that makes you bulletproof and swordproof and we were like, that's that's not real bud

01:58.360 --> 02:02.120
Yeah, but then you guys just brought me a lot about nudity like a lot

02:03.040 --> 02:07.200
New kinds of nudity internal nudity. Yeah, you spelled it in

02:07.200 --> 02:11.880
EWD which I liked don't get me wrong. I like that, right?

02:12.880 --> 02:17.840
This time I figured out a new question and I think will help us

02:18.520 --> 02:23.900
Answer questions for advice and maybe help the people at home and it's simple and that question is this

02:24.560 --> 02:29.340
What a sign help and I was going through the question list today, right?

02:29.340 --> 02:33.060
I was making it and I thought how often that could be, you know

02:33.060 --> 02:38.120
There's like flow charts of answers. They have we're just like, you know, is it this if yes

02:38.120 --> 02:45.040
Then this if no then this right and I think that we could ask would a sign help and that will be a good starting

02:45.040 --> 02:52.040
Okay, a lot of questions like a sign like a billing vault situation or I mean listen

02:52.040 --> 02:58.320
I don't want to limit what kind of sign it could be a billboard. It could be a traffic sign

02:58.320 --> 03:04.600
Oh, just like a written poster board thing. Okay, but if we can start from would a sign help?

03:04.800 --> 03:11.720
We can build off of that and give ourselves a bit more of a foundation a foundation of rock if you will instead of sand

03:12.160 --> 03:19.400
Okay, I feel we've been in the past. It sounds like maybe you just watched them that three billboards outside Bing bong, Wisconsin and

03:20.080 --> 03:22.080
You know

03:22.080 --> 03:27.920
I certainly that's not the title of it. I haven't watched two billboards yet. So I don't want to get there. Yeah. Yeah, you don't like it

03:29.920 --> 03:33.000
Damn that would have been a good joke with that film was relevant a few years

03:33.000 --> 03:36.600
I know right? Oh boy. Oh boy

03:37.120 --> 03:43.680
As a short movie too because it's just Frances McDormand and she's already sweaty for putting up the first billboard and she puts it up

03:43.680 --> 03:45.000
She's like damn this

03:45.000 --> 03:49.320
I'm still not satisfied roll credits. Yeah, I gotta get some more billboards

03:49.320 --> 03:54.400
I'm gonna need at least one more this first one says fuck Woody Harrelson and the next one says for real though

03:54.400 --> 03:57.800
But I feel like I need a third one. That's like for real though

03:57.800 --> 04:04.240
And then well, I'm waiting for four billboards where the fourth one just says you just missed those last three billboards

04:04.400 --> 04:06.920
Yeah, that was time to turn around and go back

04:07.160 --> 04:13.760
Does Francis McDormand's awesome billboard slamming Woody Harrelson work just did say something like that?

04:13.760 --> 04:21.240
I I wish I have more I wish people did that to Woody Harrelson all the time for different reasons all over the cut

04:21.240 --> 04:26.440
Oh, that's good. I wish it wasn't just his character. I wish it was like about another zombie land Woody. Yeah, Woody

04:26.720 --> 04:31.960
Hey, hey Woody make a third zombie land. I didn't watch the second one cuz I want to watch the trilogy

04:31.960 --> 04:33.960
Yeah one setting. Yeah

04:34.000 --> 04:39.240
I'm gonna show him back to back in the movie theaters, you know, yeah, I was just intended house map

04:39.240 --> 04:45.960
And Matt McConaughey do a bud and you put it right outside his house not Matt McConaughey's house, but yeah

04:47.200 --> 04:53.580
Is Matt McConaughey gonna be your governor? Matt McConaughey would be I would say a step up

04:53.580 --> 04:55.880
Maybe not the ideal candidate for the job

04:56.120 --> 05:01.080
But right now the candidate for the job who has the job is a real stinker

05:01.160 --> 05:07.280
So a bucket of what hamburgers push down a flight of stairs would be a better governor than you got right now

05:07.280 --> 05:09.280
That's not an unfair

05:09.520 --> 05:11.520
Comparison, it's not an unfair thing to say

05:12.320 --> 05:14.320
but yeah, I mean I

05:14.320 --> 05:18.600
Shit, man, if that's what if that's the way we go if that's the way we go with it

05:18.600 --> 05:20.600
I can but can we talk about?

05:20.920 --> 05:27.120
How it directly affects this program. Yeah, if Matt McConaughey becomes your

05:28.400 --> 05:32.800
Official governor he's basically it should be noted already the governor of Huntington

05:32.800 --> 05:38.560
Yeah, cuz he made a movie about Marshall here and he's 12 years ago. I think yeah, like a hundred years ago

05:38.560 --> 05:45.440
He's now all of her dad. Yeah, but like if he becomes your the governator over there, you know, well, we wouldn't call him that

05:46.080 --> 05:54.100
Yeah, but like what happens to this program my brother my brother be if if frequently there's something going on where Matt

05:55.720 --> 05:57.720
McConaughey is your

05:58.520 --> 06:02.600
Governor, I mean, I'm just worried that it's gonna eat up his time to make car commercials and stuff

06:02.600 --> 06:04.880
Like when he'll get down

06:05.360 --> 06:10.260
That Lincoln money that Lincoln my spins Austin's got beautiful rolling hills for

06:10.880 --> 06:12.880
Lincoln lawyer that Lincoln was like

06:14.920 --> 06:21.800
Okay, it's at least how it started okay, they he thinks he's still filming the movie. Yeah, he's like wins out of Lincoln lawyer sequel

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
Good arrive. All right

06:24.560 --> 06:29.160
Lincoln lawyer 2 comes out if you haven't watched all the Lincoln car commercials ARG

06:29.160 --> 06:32.640
You're gonna have missed out on a lot

06:35.640 --> 06:39.120
To follow the hunt of the car of the man behind the wheel

06:39.720 --> 06:43.080
Org yeah for it slash Matt McConaughey for gov

06:43.680 --> 06:46.460
with four V's the adventure begins

06:47.760 --> 06:54.520
He gets there and at the end you win a coupon for a free scoop of Baskin Robbins. Yeah, which is nice. I

06:54.520 --> 06:58.560
Hope he has your vote. I don't know. He's but can I be honest? I don't know

06:59.400 --> 07:05.280
Politics don't know this platform doesn't matter. He's Matthew McConaughey. I can fill in the blanks a lot. Yeah, I

07:05.960 --> 07:07.960
bet he's part of the

07:08.320 --> 07:10.320
green party

07:10.680 --> 07:14.120
You know what? I hope he's not a member of all right. All right. All right. All right

07:14.120 --> 07:22.120
Fuck it took a while to get there

07:23.000 --> 07:30.360
Yeah, see you sign out. Yep. You're right. I'm an artist lately. I've been studying architecture as a hobby

07:30.360 --> 07:33.720
Oh, I live within biking distance. That's cool. Yeah, it's cool. Badass

07:33.720 --> 07:38.840
didn't it seem like that would be that's one that I wish I could sit down for like an hour and

07:39.120 --> 07:43.280
Be able to point at buildings to be like, hmm neoclassical. Oh, right, right, right

07:43.280 --> 07:46.360
Oh, that'd be cool. Now. Here's the thing Justin. Can I tell you something?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.080
99% of time you can do that

07:49.080 --> 07:53.800
Because the person you're talking to chances that they know if you're right or wrong very slam

07:53.800 --> 07:57.320
But I'd know and that's gonna that's not gonna boost my confidence

07:57.800 --> 08:00.600
On the street and be like, oh, that's a big one. Oh, yeah

08:02.280 --> 08:08.760
It would be like if imagine the time I've spent learning about Disney World was applied to the real world. Oh, yeah

08:08.760 --> 08:12.600
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine if the way I am when we walk around Disney World

08:12.600 --> 08:13.360
I'm like, you know

08:13.360 --> 08:19.440
That's actually the is the the the letters on that window advertising that fake business are actually reference to one of the original

08:19.640 --> 08:25.000
Lawyers of the Disney World team imagine if I was like that but like for like smart shit like

08:25.680 --> 08:30.680
That's how an architect feels when they're walking around Disney with you and they're like, why did I waste time?

08:30.680 --> 08:34.320
I'm learning about architecture. I could have learned about Disney like Justin does he so cool

08:34.320 --> 08:37.080
It'd be so good. It's got architecture in it too is the problem

08:37.080 --> 08:40.220
Yeah, I mean and very rarely does architecture have Disney in it

08:40.220 --> 08:46.500
Just imagine walking around Chicago and pointing out the big buildings and be like, hmm. Yeah, that's a mid-century David Hyde Pierce

08:47.060 --> 08:51.080
Man remind me to tell you guys about the email we got about Frazier's theme song. No. No, I know

08:51.080 --> 08:54.900
I live within biking distance of a couple of old

08:55.900 --> 09:02.500
Architecturally interesting weird houses and I would love to sit and draw them and take some notes on the architectural features

09:02.980 --> 09:06.580
However, I don't think this would endear me to the occupants very much

09:06.580 --> 09:13.660
How can I complete my self-directed studies without coming off as a huge creep? That's some suspicious student in Stony Brook

09:13.800 --> 09:18.960
Okay, can I ask a stupid question? Yeah, and it's very obvious. So it must be like a stupid. Yeah, like why?

09:19.920 --> 09:24.480
What is the I don't know. I don't do like this kind of art. I'm more of an audio artist

09:24.480 --> 09:29.340
Yeah, how how does why can't you just take a picture then draw based on the picture good question

09:29.340 --> 09:33.060
So I actually in college as part of a scene design class

09:33.060 --> 09:40.960
we had to go and like draw buildings on campus and it's about like angles and getting the right like

09:41.720 --> 09:44.600
Getting the right perspective so that you can pair lines

09:44.640 --> 09:48.680
Yes compared to other things and changing your point of view and shit like that. Yeah

09:48.920 --> 09:53.720
And with so you got to kind of do it. Well with the photo you don't always get the depth

09:53.720 --> 10:02.040
Oh, yeah, there should be a way to like have photos that like fucking move. Yeah, so you can like get the

10:02.040 --> 10:04.040
Well, that's also not as fun

10:04.040 --> 10:07.520
That's you know, it's not as fun. It's also not gonna get you put into artist jail

10:07.520 --> 10:12.040
Yeah, just where we put people who do art. Well, so here's the question. Yeah, what a sign help

10:14.040 --> 10:18.700
That sign you just had a sign set up next to you. Hey, wait a minute now wait

10:18.700 --> 10:25.540
This is a good question to start asking if you put up a sign that said basically like

10:27.260 --> 10:29.260
Doing our building artist over here

10:29.340 --> 10:30.360
Yeah

10:30.360 --> 10:38.220
Building our building artist ask me anything and then a little hat because I think people are more comfortable if commerce is involved

10:40.780 --> 10:46.060
Wait, you're just doing this to make yourself happy. No this I will drop

10:46.060 --> 10:48.840
Okay, I got I got I got I got it

10:49.500 --> 10:56.340
You sit down. Uh-huh. You get your pad your pen a cup of joe and then you start drawing the houses, right?

10:56.340 --> 11:00.000
Yes, and then you have a sign that says I will draw

11:01.300 --> 11:08.940
This building for $5. Yeah, and if someone comes over and they're like, here's $5. You just be like choice

11:08.980 --> 11:11.880
Thanks. Here's the building on it working on it. I'm on it

11:11.880 --> 11:16.980
I'm working on it and they'll be like should I come back later for my drawings like, you know, get the drawing

11:16.980 --> 11:24.020
I'm just I'm drawing. Yeah, baby. $5. I'm drawing. You're not offering anything. I'm asked. Yeah, and you don't get

11:24.460 --> 11:29.420
It doesn't matter if anyone ever does it because you never see a kid like a caricature

11:29.820 --> 11:36.140
Artist is always you see him as sometimes a dizzy world and caricature artists is always sketching something

11:36.140 --> 11:38.140
Yeah, you never show you of course

11:38.140 --> 11:43.940
But they don't just sit there and stare at you and so like you hey, you've got a great chin for caricature

11:43.940 --> 11:47.540
Come on over like they're working on stuff. You're always interrupting a caricature

11:47.540 --> 11:53.320
I think that it's weird how many times a caricature wait, wait, wait, wait, both of you are talking at once Griffin

11:53.320 --> 11:56.300
You had a question. Do you think what's your question?

11:56.300 --> 12:01.680
Do you think that there are caricature artists and that's the ones that do house drawings, but they do them all

12:02.180 --> 12:07.200
Exaggerated and silly like the windows wicked big regret. I regret coming to you Griffin

12:07.200 --> 12:09.380
Now we're going to hear what Travis had excellent

12:09.380 --> 12:15.780
Do you think it's really frustrating when you're like Beyonce and you sit down at a caricature artist and the caricature artist finishes and Beyonce's?

12:15.780 --> 12:18.900
Like I'll take that please and the character artist is like no, this is really good

12:18.900 --> 12:23.540
I'm gonna put it up to display my talent and Beyonce just has to walk away without her drawing

12:23.580 --> 12:27.700
But I don't think that Beyonce usually does sit for those kinds of yeah

12:27.700 --> 12:31.900
But they always have one of Beyonce don't they some point she wants to come by got terminator

12:31.900 --> 12:36.580
They got Beyonce because this Travis has just explained is an excruciating detail

12:36.580 --> 12:39.500
You can't draw based on a picture of Beyonce. Correct. You got to have

12:40.620 --> 12:42.620
That's why they look like they do

12:43.540 --> 12:48.380
They're like, oh no, the perspectives all wrong. Her head is trying it wouldn't it be so funny

12:48.380 --> 12:51.940
If Charlie Chaplin walked up and he was like, I'll take that one of me. That's really good

12:52.500 --> 12:54.220
That's me, sir

12:54.220 --> 12:56.480
I'll purchase and then go also

12:56.480 --> 13:01.020
Why did you draw me knowing this and then fucking Gilbert Godfrey walks by and drops off a picture of himself?

13:01.100 --> 13:06.340
That is just with those same one picture that every caricature artist has he's just walking around the country dropping those off

13:06.340 --> 13:08.180
Like Johnny Appleseed

13:08.180 --> 13:13.020
He drew them himself and he's like you can display this as your work. I'm like, I guess

13:13.900 --> 13:20.580
Okay, if you're outside somebody's house drawing it would assign help and this but the sign says like hey

13:20.580 --> 13:23.060
I'm not jerking off out here. You

13:23.620 --> 13:29.080
Guaranteed nothing everything is aboveboard. I'm just sketching for a non

13:30.020 --> 13:31.380
jerk off

13:31.380 --> 13:36.580
Publication promise promise promise to the max, but damn it. Somebody could wear that sign that

13:37.180 --> 13:43.520
And be jerking that is gonna plan on doing that. Well, this is that this is one of the intricacies of the question

13:43.520 --> 13:49.100
What a sign help because yeah, like if you just wrote I'm drawing the house, right?

13:49.100 --> 13:54.620
That's not as bad as I'm drawing the house Steven Johnson who lives in it. Yeah now

13:55.300 --> 13:59.940
Now it's weird. Now. It's a problem. We need to get these signs notarized

13:59.940 --> 14:03.740
Yeah, you need a sign that says hey, I'm not jerking off down here

14:03.740 --> 14:10.660
And then there's like two signatories on the bottom and like a seal from the mayor. That's like, yep

14:10.660 --> 14:15.060
He's not he's not jerking off out here. He's just drawing. I promise trust me. I'm the mayor

14:15.660 --> 14:19.860
How about another question? Yes, I know this is unorthodox. Okay

14:20.780 --> 14:26.200
But why not? Okay. Well, I would actually can I do this wiki how article cuz let me tell you something about this fucking website guys

14:26.200 --> 14:30.780
Let me tell you something. Let me get well, no, but let me that was so much wasted

14:30.780 --> 14:34.500
Oh, no, but listen, I gotta tell you something about this website. It uses

14:35.220 --> 14:36.540
more

14:36.540 --> 14:38.620
fucking RAM on my

14:39.700 --> 14:41.940
considerably beefy rig then

14:43.460 --> 14:52.060
Ableton then the 90 audacity windows. I have open then I could be running fucking Halo 9 on this PC or

14:52.060 --> 14:56.940
I'm on my computer and it would fucking not use as much RAM as wiki

14:56.940 --> 15:00.540
How my fan is screaming cuz it's like look at all these poor images

15:01.500 --> 15:06.580
So I want to finish this and close this so that the audio will be better. Is that okay? Okay. Okay good

15:06.580 --> 15:10.060
I I found this one on wiki how and it's about

15:10.780 --> 15:15.500
Cat behavior communicating with cats, which is okay a rich rich vein on wiki

15:15.500 --> 15:22.660
How I think it's maybe just cuz people like to draw kitties and the title of the article is how to apologize to a cat. Thank

15:22.780 --> 15:24.180
apologize to a cat

15:24.180 --> 15:28.700
Step one is my cat's birthday and I've been wondering. Oh, well, this is gonna be great for you

15:28.700 --> 15:31.420
This is more about like I accidentally, you know

15:31.920 --> 15:35.140
You know bumped into him in the middle of the night and pissed him off or whatever

15:35.140 --> 15:37.820
I rubbed there for the wrong way because I've never touched a cat before

15:38.300 --> 15:43.020
So more physical sliding and not so much emotional exactly determine the offense

15:43.020 --> 15:45.780
What did you do to make your cat matters you make fun of her?

15:46.420 --> 15:48.420
Fucking oh, okay. Wait

15:48.500 --> 15:53.940
You're back in. Yeah, if you offend your cat by making fun of her, you'll probably have to offer some treats and praise

15:54.120 --> 15:56.120
yeah, your cats definitely

15:57.060 --> 16:01.120
Understands English enough to say like your butthole stinks. Mr. Chis Chisker's

16:05.460 --> 16:07.460
Chisker's and then

16:07.460 --> 16:13.180
You gotta choose a good time to apologize if the cat's angry not now approaching to see me busy

16:13.340 --> 16:16.860
If the cat's busy not right now, it's Steven. I'm on the phone

16:18.180 --> 16:22.060
This is an important call. Yeah, I told now it's even worse

16:22.860 --> 16:26.220
Listen, don't approach too soon cuz you might get scratched but don't wait too long

16:27.220 --> 16:31.420
To apologize because cats definitely will think about that stuff

16:31.900 --> 16:36.900
You can approach a frightened cat but do so with caution. I'm I'm not busy right now

16:36.900 --> 16:38.820
But I'm fucking terrified

16:38.820 --> 16:43.020
It's okay. I'm sorry. I was just listening to creepypasta. I don't have time

16:43.020 --> 16:46.740
I'm listening to creepypasta on the internet Steven, please

16:47.500 --> 16:51.980
Walk slowly to the cat. Don't rush up on it. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't do that

16:51.980 --> 16:57.660
Don't do that soft gentle talk to your cat. Tell her I'm sorry. You may even use your cat's name

16:57.660 --> 17:04.340
It will not understand either of those things I bet but try blinking slowly cuz cats love that shit

17:04.340 --> 17:09.340
Jackson galaxy Jackson slowly be be clear slow as you can

17:09.700 --> 17:16.740
Slow as you can Jackson galaxy taught that to the world back in like 2007 and every it's the only thing people remember about cats

17:17.580 --> 17:20.180
Stroke your cat gently in her favorite spots

17:20.580 --> 17:25.660
My cat's fucking terrified and I ran up on it real fast, but I know exactly where I touched this little guy

17:25.660 --> 17:29.260
So it's okay scratch behind the ear behind the cheek. It's all good

17:29.260 --> 17:35.140
Play with the cat. These are all good things. Give the cat some attention praise and compliment your cat

17:35.420 --> 17:38.700
Give your cat what he or she wants within reason

17:39.940 --> 17:43.020
Okay into something. Yeah, my car

17:43.700 --> 17:51.540
My cat fucking hates the way I talked about it's stinky, but but I am gonna give it a hundred thousand dollars

17:51.540 --> 17:55.580
I am gonna give it one night where it rules the house

17:55.580 --> 17:59.300
It eats food in the kitchen and I have to shit in its bad box

18:01.660 --> 18:07.240
Here's one thing I know about cats is that levels are very important so I cat trees are a thing

18:07.340 --> 18:10.700
Yeah, so it's a way of cast to show like they're more important than other cash

18:10.700 --> 18:16.980
So when you're apologizing your cat lay down flat on your belly with your arms of your side and kind of inch forward a little

18:16.980 --> 18:19.880
Bit yeah cat knows that you're putting it above you

18:19.880 --> 18:26.360
So then we have four entire sort of paragraphs here where the wiki how article artists was like J

18:26.360 --> 18:32.200
Jonah Jameson was like I need fucking I need 18 column inches and they're like, oh shit

18:32.200 --> 18:36.880
Well, here's four tips that are all variations on give your cat a treat

18:37.080 --> 18:41.960
Give a treat to your cat leave a cat treat surprise for your cat add treats to your cat's food

18:41.960 --> 18:46.540
Treat your cat with some special food. Good. Good. Good. Now, hold on. I want to go back to number two

18:46.540 --> 18:53.180
Yeah, the problem is if you leave a surprise treat somewhere, it might not associate that treat with you. No, awesome

18:53.180 --> 18:55.380
I'm having a shit day. Steven's been a real jack-off

18:55.780 --> 19:02.580
Tried to run up on me blinked too fast. What's this talked about my butthole talked about my asshole didn't even apologize. What's this?

19:02.580 --> 19:09.160
What's this? What's this a special surprise unrelated to Steven offer some dried catnip. Okay

19:09.540 --> 19:13.620
Hey, yes, I'm not man enough to apologize to my sweet. Mr

19:13.620 --> 19:20.860
Chiskers, but I won't get him fucking fucked up and then maybe when he's in that state he will be more amenable to apologize

19:20.860 --> 19:25.140
Yeah, what'd you do Steven? You talked about my asshole. I don't even remember man

19:26.300 --> 19:29.340
You joke at that, but this is the thing humans do to other humans

19:29.340 --> 19:31.620
Like I'm gonna take you out to a drink to apologize

19:31.620 --> 19:36.380
I think humans do to other humans and then y'all watch the tail

19:36.420 --> 19:42.660
Oh my god, if the tail is pointed up with the tip curled to the side that cat's okay to come

19:42.660 --> 19:49.540
I'm poofed up cat the cat's frightened which as we learned earlier in the article not entirely a deal breaker if he's thumping it though

19:49.700 --> 19:52.900
No, no, no walk right away walk. What if his tail?

19:53.420 --> 19:56.380
Makes the perfect shape of a question mark. Yeah

19:57.300 --> 20:00.280
Mmm, that means he's got a puzzle for you. Follow

20:01.180 --> 20:06.540
Follow the cat and don't stop following it until you've reached the puzzle cuz it's somewhere look at the face

20:06.820 --> 20:12.580
That's helpful. Are the whiskers pointed teeth Baird and nose wrinkled. That's the 101 angry cat stuff

20:12.580 --> 20:16.420
So don't do that things angry if anything did that I'm like, that's a problem

20:16.660 --> 20:17.500
Yeah

20:17.500 --> 20:22.340
Now I want to hop down to the community Q&A because someone asked is there a quick and easy way to apologize for little things?

20:22.380 --> 20:28.700
Which is fucking awesome. You've read this whole article and you're like, that's too much time. I can't approach a cat slowly

20:28.700 --> 20:31.980
I'm a businessman on the go. I got stocks to trade and houses to close on

20:31.980 --> 20:37.660
I can't I can't walk up on my cat slow and then blink slow. I'm not made of time or money

20:37.660 --> 20:42.980
You can just say sorry cat name in sweet apologetic voice and pet them gently on the spot

20:42.980 --> 20:47.100
They like so sort of a condo. That's the only two points on this list that really matter

20:47.260 --> 20:51.180
Do you think it's just generating like if you're still clicking through?

20:52.300 --> 20:59.260
It'll just keep making question. Hey, there's like an AI that's like generating answers like do another one about treats

20:59.260 --> 21:01.260
Yeah, they're still clicking

21:01.420 --> 21:03.960
I just took my cat to the vet and they had to give him a shot now

21:03.960 --> 21:04.900
He's mad at me and scared me

21:04.900 --> 21:11.700
What do I do now you fucking say to the cat like, I'm sorry. I don't want you to fucking get a heart disease. Mr

21:11.700 --> 21:12.700
Chisker's yeah

21:12.700 --> 21:16.180
You can be pissed off at me if you want because I gave you an expensive shot

21:16.180 --> 21:21.860
So you don't die from cats diseases of which mr. Chisker's I will say there are thousands and

21:22.540 --> 21:28.620
Sometimes they sound fucking made up by the vet who's just trying to sell you men. Oh you shots. Yeah. Sorry, mr

21:28.620 --> 21:34.300
Chisker's that I love you so much. I don't want you to fucking die at age five and grateful shit

21:34.300 --> 21:36.540
How does here's a wiki article?

21:36.540 --> 21:41.300
How does my cat apologize to me for being a real shit after I gave it medicine?

21:41.300 --> 21:47.420
So it doesn't die from a lung disease of which there are thousands for cats how to make my cat understand responsibility

21:47.440 --> 21:52.980
Yeah, you raise it actually pretty good point about vets. I'm kind of worried about that now cuz like think about it

21:52.980 --> 21:57.940
It's the worst. It's kind of like with the other mechanic and he's like you need a new Farberator

21:57.940 --> 22:03.300
Yeah, it's like I don't think I did. I don't trust you. I'm going to drive away now

22:03.300 --> 22:07.300
I'd see what happens and roll the dice and the check-in July comes on in like a week

22:07.300 --> 22:13.380
Yeah, that's right. If that happens with your pet then that's that's no good. You don't like that

22:13.380 --> 22:16.620
That's a good cast don't have a check-in July, you know what I mean?

22:16.620 --> 22:22.020
They just have shoebox and and and so it's like you I don't how do you trust your vet?

22:22.020 --> 22:26.260
Cuz they do don't they understand it way better than you do. This is awesome. You just gotta do whatever they say

22:26.260 --> 22:33.420
We're being honest chances are for a change. My dogs are in cahoots with that vet the dog a little bit

22:33.420 --> 22:35.460
I go in and the vets like oh, yeah

22:35.460 --> 22:42.060
No, he's got a bad case of kibble cough or whatever. That'll be $500 and then he slips my dogs and treats

22:42.060 --> 22:46.500
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, your your parakeet is getting its beak wet on this

22:48.140 --> 22:53.900
Involved it's so cool that we can be on the ground floor of this like anti-vax but for animals move

22:53.900 --> 22:57.120
But like it seems like not really. No, it doesn't seem like

22:59.540 --> 23:02.540
Then you have to make it all Griffin gotta get political

23:03.060 --> 23:06.180
God Griffin, it's always getting political. What's next Griffin?

23:06.180 --> 23:08.580
You and the vets are gonna team up to write us

23:08.700 --> 23:13.780
Emails and talk about how kibble coffee is real and it's very bad and it cost $500

23:15.420 --> 23:17.420
Wait, are you involved? No, no

23:17.900 --> 23:21.300
All I goes all the way to the top of big podcast listen

23:21.300 --> 23:26.780
Listen, I know what I just said, but I do and I I love our nation's vets

23:26.980 --> 23:33.860
But but only our nation's vets and let me just say though. It is weird how it's always $500

23:37.220 --> 23:43.900
Special food. Uh-huh. They're like, oh no, he's got double butt worms. That's 500 big ones. That's like shit

23:43.900 --> 23:45.900
I just paid you 500 big ones

23:45.900 --> 23:53.180
Sometimes we get emails and tweets that we don't deserve and I make it very clear to people

23:53.540 --> 23:58.220
It was it's my dad and my therapist and my wife. I said I did not deserve this tweet

23:59.820 --> 24:04.760
No, Justin you did not deserve it. You did not deserve the tweet. You did not deserve the mean email people

24:04.760 --> 24:09.680
You don't you boys don't deserve it. You're trying your best. I feel like this past five minutes

24:09.680 --> 24:14.560
One of those yeah, I get it. It's one of those times when we're gonna get the tweets

24:14.560 --> 24:17.960
So we're gonna get the emails and we're gonna say yeah. Yeah this one

24:19.200 --> 24:22.280
This one. Yeah, we were just kind of we knew

24:24.720 --> 24:29.760
We knew it we deserve the tweets now and I guess I would say Lord I apologize

24:33.000 --> 24:36.720
Maybe we can flip it in the end cuz I don't know that we said anything like

24:36.720 --> 24:43.880
Fully like that identifies it when we said that we weren't talking about veterans. So maybe we oh, yeah

24:43.880 --> 24:48.760
Yeah pin it on veterans and say like, yeah, I don't know why veterans always are charging

24:49.640 --> 24:51.640
to fix our pets

24:52.000 --> 24:53.060
Okay

24:53.060 --> 24:58.720
Currently I am do you think there's any veterans who went on to be veterinarian? That's gotta be good. That's funny, right?

24:59.540 --> 25:03.580
They probably didn't firm people and then people want to check them out to see if they're any good

25:03.580 --> 25:05.580
So you're vetting the vet vet?

25:05.580 --> 25:07.580
one more

25:07.900 --> 25:13.860
Then and then okay, we're gonna wait and then he's selling his Corvette and you want to check out and see if it's any good

25:13.860 --> 25:15.860
So you're vetting the vet vets vet?

25:15.860 --> 25:19.820
You got there. Thank you. Thank you

25:21.140 --> 25:25.160
And he named a bet middler. So you're vetting the vet vets vet bet

25:26.620 --> 25:31.620
All right, you're vetting the vet vet vets bet you should have stopped at four

25:31.620 --> 25:37.060
There's not a comedy rule. It's when I started cheating. That's when I started cheating to change the letter

25:37.940 --> 25:39.940
Yeah, change the letter

25:41.020 --> 25:45.300
Currently I'm sitting in the stretching area of my gym sounds disorienting

25:45.300 --> 26:05.300
There's no earthly way. Welcome to the stretching area. Why don't you touch the ceiling? Oh you can't, there it goes.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.300
Welcome to taffy town

26:07.300 --> 26:14.820
We've belabored this enough so that even our dullest listeners can get on it now

26:15.180 --> 26:18.140
Get it. I had a cor- this non-joke

26:18.140 --> 26:22.620
I had a quarter in my pocket and I just looked over to see my quarter rolling across the floor

26:22.900 --> 26:27.540
Landing against the stretching mat of the girl closest to me who is like five feet away

26:28.140 --> 26:31.020
My quarter is leaning up against her mat. She hasn't noticed

26:31.020 --> 26:38.260
Brothers, do I cut my losses and leave my quarter or do I ask her for it back and try to explain that my quarter

26:38.260 --> 26:44.300
Rolled out of my pocket to her mat, even though that sounds like an absolute lie. That's from runaway quarter in

26:44.660 --> 26:46.660
Run- run- kunkama

26:46.900 --> 26:50.180
Run- kunkama. I mean, it's not a lie. The quarter's there

26:51.540 --> 26:53.540
Who but?

26:54.140 --> 26:56.140
Did you just I want

26:56.140 --> 27:00.620
Before we get into the specifics of this, I would like to talk about quarters, okay?

27:01.340 --> 27:08.620
Pennies, dimes, nickels, throw them all in the garbage truck. Now a dime, I disagree. Yeah. A dime is so little

27:08.620 --> 27:15.540
It takes up so little effort to pick it up. A quarter. Oh man. Where I'm at in my life right now

27:16.180 --> 27:18.180
You still will come across

27:18.660 --> 27:20.580
like a

27:20.580 --> 27:23.060
Vending machine you want to get yourself some Trident

27:23.060 --> 27:26.540
Yeah, or maybe you want to park a car and you gotta put a quarter in there

27:26.540 --> 27:30.700
Or you have a quarter. You're all still need from time to time and to me

27:30.700 --> 27:35.980
I so rarely use cash that I never even really encounter quarters

27:36.180 --> 27:40.060
So the value of the quarter has actually exceeded

27:41.020 --> 27:47.700
The value of the quarter due to rarity. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes due to rarity. How did I get a quarter?

27:47.700 --> 27:51.700
I can- there have been times in the past like literal month of my adult life

27:51.700 --> 27:56.780
I've been like, ooh two quarters. Yeah, like a little excited in my pocket. What's that jingle-jangle?

27:56.780 --> 28:01.380
I don't ever get these bad boys. Guess daddy's getting some Trident. I'll tell you the mistake I made

28:01.900 --> 28:05.820
About two years ago. Just went to the bank hand him a $10 bill

28:05.820 --> 28:10.140
It said give me a roll of quarters and then I just emptied it into the center console of my car

28:10.300 --> 28:16.740
So I would always have a quarter if I needed it, but then I should put and that's why that high-speed collision was in fact

28:16.740 --> 28:22.020
very bad. Incredibly bad. It was basically a dirty bomb at that point, but

28:22.020 --> 28:26.260
Then I started to take for granted that the quarter would always be there

28:27.900 --> 28:33.500
And then one day I pull up to Aussie and I need to get my Aldi card out by putting a quarter into the cart

28:34.220 --> 28:39.460
No quarter, and I'm the asshole running around with two dimes and a nickel like hey, can I- will anybody trade?

28:39.460 --> 28:42.220
Will you trade? Who will buy trades? Who's doing coin trades?

28:42.220 --> 28:46.020
Who will buy my nickel and dimes?

28:47.100 --> 28:51.460
That's a mistake I made. I emptied out my 401k for- and I got it all in quarters

28:51.460 --> 28:56.900
I went to Dave on Busters, and I was like I'm gonna have the best weekend ever and then they were like we do digital

28:57.260 --> 28:59.260
cards, we don't do points anymore.

29:00.860 --> 29:06.460
Fuck. I'll tell you who fucking loves quarters. Four-year-olds. I hand BB three quarters

29:06.460 --> 29:14.700
She's a kid. No, she's four guys. Like tic-tac. She doesn't eat quarters. That's my 18-year-old.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.260
Great Wolf Lodge Arcade does the digital cards

29:18.260 --> 29:24.980
And I tell you guys when you start hitting the slots really hard trying to get the- you don't really feel that money leaving so much

29:25.220 --> 29:30.180
When it's on a card you're trying to get that like Squidward. Oh, yeah. You need to complete your Spongebob card.

29:30.180 --> 29:34.140
I mean the Gary is the hard to get one. That's the Chase. The Gary's the Chase one for sure.

29:34.140 --> 29:40.140
Just like the Toto in the Wizard of Oz one. That's the Chase. Oh, man. This sucks because she's stretching.

29:40.140 --> 29:46.140
Oh, yeah. So you can't- you can't- let me say this- you can't go over. You can't approach.

29:46.140 --> 29:48.700
So here's the question. Would a sign help?

29:50.060 --> 29:57.860
I mean, damn it. You could still maybe even use the I'm not jerking off out here sign to like walk over and grab the coin and

29:57.860 --> 30:04.900
And that even the presence of that feels like harassment. Yeah, so I think in this circumstance the answer is no.

30:05.220 --> 30:10.940
Yeah, because the amount of effort one would need to put into making a sign to explain that your quarter rolled over there.

30:10.940 --> 30:15.940
That's too much effort. We haven't established the value of quarters though.

30:15.940 --> 30:20.140
This is what I'm struggling with is like, what do you have

30:20.140 --> 30:28.140
later in the day that you needed that quarter for? It's got to be important because you got dressed for the gym and you thought,

30:28.140 --> 30:32.140
well, I'm taking this quarter with me. Gotta put this quarter in my waistband.

30:32.140 --> 30:38.140
The only thing that makes sense is that they found the quarter earlier, in which case, easy come easy go.

30:38.140 --> 30:42.140
You gotta let it go. You gotta let it go. Yeah, now it's on its journey, right? It's continuing on.

30:42.140 --> 30:46.140
You were but a waypoint on this quarter's journey. Yeah.

30:46.140 --> 30:53.140
But if it's your quarter and you have big plans and this is the one gym in the world that sells big bottles of Powerade for a quarter

30:53.140 --> 30:58.140
and you were going to slam that sweet blue stuff after your workout. Yeah, you got to get that quarter back.

30:58.140 --> 31:02.140
And here's the thing. I think that this is, listen, this is not a perfect solution,

31:02.140 --> 31:07.140
but you could quickly walk over, murmur, I dropped my quarter and pick it up and get back.

31:07.140 --> 31:14.140
They will judge you. The person will judge you. But you're in and you're out fast enough that your hope is you're not memorable.

31:14.140 --> 31:23.140
It's not a remarkable incident. Right. But you can't, again, you can't go over there. You can't.

31:23.140 --> 31:27.140
Ah, damn it. I was going to say big magnet, but that doesn't work on quarters, does it? No, no, no.

31:27.140 --> 31:29.140
It doesn't work on quarters. They're probably zinc or something.

31:29.140 --> 31:34.140
You could train an animal to get it for you, but that's kind of a long thing.

31:34.140 --> 31:38.140
You have to just hope that they don't pick up the quarter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gotta wait it out.

31:38.140 --> 31:46.140
I see a big, beautiful quarter with no one nearby. Especially just leaning there on my mat calling to me. It's my quarter.

31:46.140 --> 31:50.140
Now here's, you do need to be careful. You need, okay, while they're still stretching on the mat,

31:50.140 --> 31:54.140
you need to forget that quarter exists and keep doing whatever you're doing.

31:54.140 --> 32:01.140
Because if there's even a whiff of you staring over there and checking, they're not going to assume you're looking at a quarter. Right?

32:01.140 --> 32:09.140
It's, I don't, I've never really been a gym guy. Really? What? No.

32:09.140 --> 32:12.140
I don't know. But, Griffin, you're so beefy and strong.

32:12.140 --> 32:17.140
Well, I do it at home with all the big flower bags of flour that I carry around.

32:17.140 --> 32:24.140
Oh, yeah, you do more of the rocky found stuff. No, it's mostly just big bags of flour I got at Costco.

32:24.140 --> 32:36.140
And I don't know what the sort of status quo is vis-a-vis talking to or looking at other people who are exercising.

32:36.140 --> 32:43.140
Because I'll say this, when I exercise in my office, I draw the blinds. I shut the doors.

32:43.140 --> 32:50.140
No one should have to see that, and I don't want anyone to see that, and I don't want to see other people doing it.

32:50.140 --> 33:01.140
And so, I don't, this is unacceptable. I think if you go get the quarter, there's a good chance you may be removed from the premises.

33:01.140 --> 33:08.140
Is there a way that you could play it like, oh, wait, hold on, sorry, real quick, oh, oh, that was close, when you pick up the quarter?

33:08.140 --> 33:12.140
If it's still rolling, if it's, ooh, that's it, you fucked up already.

33:12.140 --> 33:21.140
If you do this instinctively, if the quarter goes, bye, you stretch too hard, bye, and starts to roll away, if you jump at it then,

33:21.140 --> 33:29.140
and like, Grabbitball, it's doing its little like spinny thing, and you like slap your hand down on it, and the other person's so scared,

33:29.140 --> 33:34.140
and you're like, look, and you show them it's a quarter, and they'll be like, oh, glad you got it, that's it.

33:34.140 --> 33:42.140
Also, because your body will naturally make a noise that's like, whoa, when you get it, that'll make it clear like, yeah,

33:42.140 --> 33:49.140
I'm not trying to connect with you or impress you in any way, this is 100% about the quarter, because if it were not,

33:49.140 --> 33:53.140
my body would not have made that noise in front of you, another human being.

33:53.140 --> 33:57.140
What about, hey, you dropped your quarter.

33:57.140 --> 34:04.140
And if they say, that's not my quarter, you say, congratulations, you've passed.

34:04.140 --> 34:06.140
But what if they say, that is my quarter?

34:06.140 --> 34:14.140
Then you know something terrible about that, and you can fucking, there is no link that person will not go to to cover up the fact that they just lied to you.

34:14.140 --> 34:16.140
Yeah, it's time to ruin their life, you know what I mean?

34:16.140 --> 34:18.140
Yeah, it's time to ruin them.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.140
Do an announcement on the gym announcer.

34:20.140 --> 34:24.140
Hey, everyone, we have a real singer.

34:24.140 --> 34:26.140
Everybody join me.

34:26.140 --> 34:29.140
Don't drop a quarter near Laura.

34:29.140 --> 34:33.140
Announcement, don't drop a quarter near Laura, she'll just gobble it right up like Batman.

34:33.140 --> 34:36.140
Also, could someone spot me for a Powerade after my workout?

34:36.140 --> 34:37.140
I'm so fucking thirsty.

34:37.140 --> 34:39.140
Yes, also, I need a quarter.

34:39.140 --> 34:41.140
Shit.

34:41.140 --> 34:48.140
You also look over and say, penny for your thoughts, and they'll say, that is a quarter, and then you run away.

34:48.140 --> 34:50.140
You run away laughing.

34:50.140 --> 34:53.140
Let's take a break and go to the Mayzone.

34:53.140 --> 35:03.140
I'll tell you guys, there's two things I love.

35:03.140 --> 35:05.140
Wait, I want to do it.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.140
I want to do it.

35:07.140 --> 35:11.140
Welcome to my perfect sight.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.140
Hey, everybody, it's Justin McElroy.

35:13.140 --> 35:19.140
Welcome to my talk show, My Perfect Sight, where we talk about my incredible 2020 vision.

35:19.140 --> 35:24.140
We talk to a guest who wants to get my abilities through artificial augmentation.

35:24.140 --> 35:33.140
Today, we have a pair of podcasting brothers, Travis and Griffin McElroy, and they want to get a little bit of my perfect sight.

35:33.140 --> 35:38.140
Boys, what are you trying to get this incredible 2020 vision that you crave?

35:38.140 --> 35:40.140
It's pronounced McLeoroy, please.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.140
McLeoroy, my mistake.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.140
We go to Warby Parker.

35:44.140 --> 35:50.140
They have affordable glasses, including prescription lenses, sunglasses, progressives.

35:50.140 --> 35:53.140
They're a very progressive company.

35:53.140 --> 35:58.140
They have blue light lenses, and this show feels weird.

35:58.140 --> 36:00.140
I don't know that I love this show.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.140
Yeah, it feels very judgmental.

36:01.140 --> 36:03.140
What's the aesthetic?

36:03.140 --> 36:04.140
I mean, it's cool.

36:04.140 --> 36:06.140
It's vintage inspired with a contemporary twist.

36:06.140 --> 36:11.140
I mean, every pair is custom fit with really cool lenses and shit.

36:11.140 --> 36:13.140
I own a lot of Warby Parker already.

36:13.140 --> 36:20.140
When I wear glasses, it makes me feel kind of like a cyborg because I'm enhancing my vision through artificial means.

36:20.140 --> 36:22.140
Now, boys, I have a question.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.140
The glasses sound beautiful.

36:24.140 --> 36:30.140
I'm looking at you two, and you look great, and the deals sound great.

36:30.140 --> 36:37.140
My big question for you, and I think a lot of our home audience is wondering this as well, why not just look at things with your perfect eyes?

36:37.140 --> 36:45.140
Yeah, we took a quiz. You take a quiz, but a fun one, not like a school one, and then they send you a home try-on kit with a bunch of-

36:45.140 --> 36:46.140
How do you see it?

36:46.140 --> 36:47.140
Oh, boy.

36:47.140 --> 36:51.140
With my glasses that I'm wearing, and you get it-

36:51.140 --> 36:56.140
Your bad, shameful glasses that you're trying to replace.

36:56.140 --> 37:06.140
You try them on. They send five different frames, and you try them on, and you see what looks good, and you pick them, and later they send you the glasses, and it looks good on your face.

37:06.140 --> 37:20.140
And it's very important for people like Griffin and I who have very large heads, and things that fit normal human beings don't always fit us, so we use the home try-on kits just to make sure it doesn't look like a novelty thing.

37:20.140 --> 37:23.140
This is one thing I can actually sympathize with you.

37:23.140 --> 37:30.140
If we are us, and you ever lose or break your sunglasses, and people are like, just go get another pair over there. They've got a whole rack of them.

37:30.140 --> 37:31.140
Nope.

37:31.140 --> 37:34.140
No. We need a special store for us.

37:34.140 --> 37:42.140
If they look like the anime character where they draw them with really tiny circle glasses on their giant head, that's us in real life.

37:42.140 --> 37:45.140
Regular glasses look like Mr. Potato Head glasses on us.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.140
Yes.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.140
This got real personal.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.140
It did.

37:48.140 --> 37:56.140
And also, Justin brings up a great point where that me and Travis have to wear glasses because of our prescription, but Justin wears Gunners for fun.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.140
I call them funners.

37:57.140 --> 38:05.140
You can try on Warby Parker for free with the home try-on program. You order five pairs of glasses to try on at home for free for five days, and there's no obligation to buy.

38:14.140 --> 38:17.140
Welcome to My Perfect Stamps!

38:17.140 --> 38:22.140
This is the show where Griffin and I have perfect stamps because we use stamps.com.

38:22.140 --> 38:23.140
Justin's got dirty stamps.

38:23.140 --> 38:24.140
Justin's got dirty stamps.

38:24.140 --> 38:27.140
Justin buys used stamps.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.140
He buys used old stamps, and he puts them in a book.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.140
He doesn't even use them to send letters or anything.

38:32.140 --> 38:38.140
He just gets them, and then he looks at them, and he's still going to the post office wasting that time like a real goober.

38:38.140 --> 38:39.140
I don't get it.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.140
You know what I heard, Griffin?

38:41.140 --> 38:42.140
What did you hear?

38:42.140 --> 38:44.140
He doesn't have anything better to do except go to the post office.

38:44.140 --> 38:45.140
For sure, for sure.

38:45.140 --> 38:47.140
And he doesn't like saving on postage.

38:47.140 --> 38:56.140
He likes wasting his money on old, dirty stamps that people have already licked or postage that comes from the post office, and he doesn't want to spend time with his family.

38:56.140 --> 38:59.140
That's the worst part for me, if you ask me.

38:59.140 --> 39:06.140
That's the worst part for me is he says, going to the post office gives me an excuse to not have to see the smiling faces of my children.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.140
And he said, my only friends are at the post office.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.140
And I was like, that's fucked up.

39:11.140 --> 39:17.140
Every day I go and buy more stamps just so I can see Postman Steve's smiling face because I like it more than my own children.

39:17.140 --> 39:21.140
It's weird because Postman Steve doesn't know who Justin is.

39:21.140 --> 39:23.140
No, but Justin is giving him gifts.

39:23.140 --> 39:26.140
He gives him gifts every time he goes to see him.

39:26.140 --> 39:27.140
I've been keeping Italian.

39:27.140 --> 39:33.140
So far, you guys are up to three 100% accurate statements that you have made, and I'd really like to hear one.

39:33.140 --> 39:37.140
Stamps.com brings the same U.S. Postal and UPS shipping services right to your computer.

39:37.140 --> 39:43.140
They print official U.S. postage and shipping labels while you print them 24-7 without having to leave your desk or buy any fancy equipment.

39:43.140 --> 39:52.140
All you need is your computer and a standard printer, and they offer deals you can't get anywhere else, like 40% off USPS and up to 66% off UPS shipping rates.

39:52.140 --> 39:59.140
And if you have really good peripheral vision, you can click and print those stamps while staring at your children's smiling faces

39:59.140 --> 40:11.140
or your cats or your dogs or house plants or a puzzle you completed and then lacquer it and put it up on the wall, whatever you want to look at that you like more than going outside, which I totally get, you can do that.

40:11.140 --> 40:17.140
So don't waste any more time looking at your kids, and don't go to the post office.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.140

40:39.140 --> 40:41.140
Hello, I'm Riley Smyrl.

40:41.140 --> 40:42.140
I'm Sydney McElroy.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.140
And I'm Taylor Smyrl.

40:44.140 --> 40:48.140
And we host Still Buffering, a cross-generational guide to the culture that made us.

40:48.140 --> 40:55.140
Every week, we share media that made us who we are, things like Archie Comics, Sailor Moon.

40:55.140 --> 40:57.140
And lots of Taylor Swift.

40:57.140 --> 41:01.140
And now that Riley's an adult, it comes with 100% more butts.

41:01.140 --> 41:04.140
And now I am totally comfortable with it.

41:04.140 --> 41:10.140
So check out new episodes of Still Buffering every Thursday on MaximumFun.org.

41:11.140 --> 41:12.140
Butts, butts, butts. Join in, Riley.

41:12.140 --> 41:15.140
Butts, butts, butts.

41:23.140 --> 41:25.140
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-evolution.

41:25.140 --> 41:25.980
What?

41:26.980 --> 41:27.820
Step two.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.000
Evolved.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I want to munch, too.

41:37.140 --> 41:38.940
I want to munch.

41:38.940 --> 41:39.780
Squat four.

41:44.380 --> 41:46.300
Welcome to Munch Squad Evolved.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.200
This is an evolution of Munch Squad

41:48.200 --> 41:50.020
in a podcast within a podcast.

41:50.020 --> 41:52.240
We're a profile of the latest and greatest in brand eating.

41:52.240 --> 41:57.240
I cannot, I can no longer rely on the quick service

41:57.860 --> 41:59.700
restaurants and their press departments

41:59.700 --> 42:02.240
to give me what I crave.

42:02.240 --> 42:06.560
So I've decided to help Munch Squad along a little bit

42:06.560 --> 42:09.640
with the evolve, sort of a, this is called,

42:09.640 --> 42:11.120
I call it people's choice.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.780
This is Munch Squad people's choice.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.040
And here's the deal.

42:18.220 --> 42:22.100
Okay, so welcome to Munch Squad Evolved, people's choice.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.260
This is where I, here's the thing.

42:24.260 --> 42:27.540
I am a member of several different groups on Facebook

42:27.540 --> 42:30.500
devoted to restaurants in my area.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.700
Really?

42:31.700 --> 42:33.780
And I wanted to see what the people are saying.

42:33.780 --> 42:34.820
You know what I mean?

42:34.820 --> 42:36.860
Because you can listen to the press releases

42:36.860 --> 42:38.740
and what they say about the restaurants,

42:38.740 --> 42:41.860
but what are the people saying about the restaurants?

42:41.860 --> 42:42.700
That's what I'm gonna do.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.100
Okay, okay.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.940
Okay, so this is, I'm not even gonna say

42:45.940 --> 42:47.260
what groups they're from because honestly,

42:47.260 --> 42:48.800
I don't want people to join them

42:48.800 --> 42:50.100
and make things weird for everybody.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.700
Cause this is just for kind of like us West Virginians

42:52.700 --> 42:55.700
to get in there and dish on the dishes,

42:55.700 --> 42:57.660
as we say in the groups.

42:59.340 --> 43:00.780
But mainly it's reviews.

43:00.780 --> 43:02.020
That's what people like to leave.

43:02.020 --> 43:05.620
So you can kind of get a sense of the good Taco Bell.

43:05.620 --> 43:06.440
You know what I mean?

43:06.440 --> 43:07.280
Yeah. Okay.

43:08.380 --> 43:10.740
I hadn't been to Steak Escape in Kanawha City

43:10.740 --> 43:13.780
for quite a while and thought I would drive through

43:13.780 --> 43:15.260
and bring it home for dinner.

43:15.260 --> 43:18.780
So this, what this person's provided is a justification

43:18.780 --> 43:20.900
for why they have decided to go to a restaurant

43:20.900 --> 43:21.980
and purchase food.

43:21.980 --> 43:23.100
It's so important.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.900
Cause a lot of restaurant reviews will leave out

43:24.900 --> 43:27.340
the fact that they wanted to buy food.

43:27.340 --> 43:28.700
While I was waiting in line,

43:28.700 --> 43:32.260
I saw a guy in front of M&M Mart sitting on the curb

43:32.260 --> 43:34.460
and shouting out to people who ignored him.

43:35.700 --> 43:39.380
Seemed to be under some kind of influence.

43:39.380 --> 43:41.900
Suddenly he was knocking on my window

43:41.900 --> 43:46.060
and told me that the food at this Steak Escape was bad.

43:46.060 --> 43:47.620
Oh no.

43:47.620 --> 43:49.260
And he said the last time he ate there,

43:49.260 --> 43:50.700
he was sick for a week.

43:50.700 --> 43:52.100
So, okay.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.980
Let me tell you what this person has just described

43:54.980 --> 43:57.100
is a situation where they go to Steak Escape,

43:57.100 --> 44:00.420
they see someone yelling at people who won't believe them.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.540
They're ignoring them.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.260
And then they run and say,

44:03.260 --> 44:05.780
don't eat at the Steak Escape.

44:05.780 --> 44:07.740
It's bad.

44:07.740 --> 44:09.980
It's very relevant to this person's life.

44:09.980 --> 44:12.380
What's wonderful about this is it's a real world

44:12.380 --> 44:16.380
like example of why if somebody busted into

44:16.380 --> 44:17.580
wherever you are right now and said,

44:17.580 --> 44:19.260
I'm you from the future,

44:19.260 --> 44:20.580
don't do what you're about to do.

44:20.580 --> 44:22.340
You'd be like, okay, whatever.

44:22.340 --> 44:23.820
They're under the influence of something.

44:23.820 --> 44:26.620
This person is doing the Lord's work

44:26.620 --> 44:28.620
trying to keep you from getting butt sick

44:28.620 --> 44:29.940
at Steak Escape.

44:29.940 --> 44:32.260
I don't know how to catch people before they go in.

44:32.260 --> 44:34.540
So I'm just waiting outside to tell people

44:34.540 --> 44:36.700
that it's like, don't eat at this one, okay?

44:36.700 --> 44:38.540
It made me really sick.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.180
I appreciate that.

44:40.180 --> 44:43.280
Yeah, except this person, this review writer says,

44:43.280 --> 44:45.460
I thought he was just a little nutty

44:45.460 --> 44:48.320
and continue to pay for my food and take it home.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.900
I continue to pay for my food and take it home.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.380
I had COVID in January

44:53.380 --> 44:55.900
and smell and taste are still not quite back.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.100
At home, I opened the sandwich wrapper

44:59.100 --> 45:01.780
and my Grand Escape looked fine.

45:01.780 --> 45:02.620
I took a bite.

45:02.620 --> 45:05.180
And as I did, I got a whiff of the sandwich.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.900
Whoa, that's the order that it took.

45:06.900 --> 45:07.740
I guess.

45:09.060 --> 45:12.460
There's like 20 comments on this review

45:12.460 --> 45:16.140
where people are like, please explain to me the mechanics of,

45:16.140 --> 45:18.940
I bit the sandwich and then later on I smell.

45:18.940 --> 45:22.220
Well, Justin, taste and smell were very clear.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.220
Not quite back, right?

45:24.220 --> 45:27.380
I took a bite and as I did, I got a whiff of the sandwich.

45:27.380 --> 45:29.900
I smelled it and then asked my granddaughter

45:29.900 --> 45:31.940
to see if it smelled okay to her.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.460
Hey, come here.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.140
Get over here.

45:35.140 --> 45:39.140
Hey, get over here and smell mama's stinky sandwich.

45:39.140 --> 45:39.960
Oh yeah, that's-

45:39.960 --> 45:40.980
Hey, me must-

45:40.980 --> 45:42.780
That smells fucking rancid, grandma.

45:42.780 --> 45:43.740
You should not eat that.

45:43.740 --> 45:44.940
I already did.

45:44.940 --> 45:45.780
Fuck.

45:46.780 --> 45:49.380
If only I could have smelled it before I ate it.

45:49.380 --> 45:50.460
Damn it.

45:50.460 --> 45:51.300
Ugh.

45:51.300 --> 45:52.180
It tastes fine.

45:52.180 --> 45:55.220
I smelled it and then asked my granddaughter

45:55.220 --> 45:56.700
to see if it smelled okay to her.

45:56.700 --> 46:00.060
It says in parentheses, she knew nothing about the guy.

46:00.060 --> 46:00.900
That's important.

46:00.900 --> 46:01.740
That is important.

46:01.740 --> 46:02.580
I was gonna ask.

46:02.580 --> 46:03.420
I'm so glad that you said that.

46:03.420 --> 46:04.340
She's not biased.

46:04.340 --> 46:05.340
Yes.

46:05.340 --> 46:07.100
Although I don't know how cool your life is.

46:07.100 --> 46:09.940
If that happened to me, as soon as I walked in the door,

46:09.940 --> 46:11.500
I would be telling my wife this incredible story.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.740
I met an angel today.

46:12.740 --> 46:13.580
Yeah.

46:13.580 --> 46:15.820
Except you're the villain in that story, aren't you?

46:15.820 --> 46:17.180
Because someone was waiting outside

46:17.180 --> 46:18.100
to tell you don't eat here.

46:18.100 --> 46:18.940
Well, that's the thing.

46:18.940 --> 46:19.780
And then you still did.

46:19.780 --> 46:20.620
And if you went home,

46:20.620 --> 46:22.940
and I'm not just saying this specifically about Sydney,

46:22.940 --> 46:24.860
but if you went home and told your wife this story,

46:24.860 --> 46:26.380
and whoever you're telling this story to

46:26.380 --> 46:28.380
was not there to see it,

46:28.380 --> 46:31.660
their first thing is going to be, and you still did it?

46:31.660 --> 46:32.860
Like, because-

46:32.860 --> 46:33.700
Yeah, it's impossible.

46:33.700 --> 46:37.460
That's how I feel, person writing this comment.

46:37.460 --> 46:39.460
I smelled it and then asked my granddaughter

46:39.460 --> 46:40.500
to see if it smelled okay to her.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.140
She knew nothing about the guy.

46:42.140 --> 46:44.140
She said, it smells like poop.

46:44.140 --> 46:48.180
Well, that's exactly what I thought when I smelled it.

46:48.180 --> 46:51.260
Or in other words, bad meat.

46:51.260 --> 46:52.100
Damn it.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.460
The guy wasn't crazy after all.

46:54.460 --> 46:55.300
No.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.500
It was bad.

46:56.500 --> 46:59.660
I think this is a great example of a sign would have helped.

46:59.660 --> 47:00.500
Yeah.

47:00.500 --> 47:04.700
Because if that gentleman had had a well-constructed sign

47:04.700 --> 47:06.460
that he had clearly spent some time working on-

47:06.460 --> 47:07.740
An official looking sign.

47:07.740 --> 47:08.580
Thank you.

47:08.580 --> 47:10.340
And it was framed, right?

47:10.340 --> 47:11.700
Then you see that and you're like,

47:11.700 --> 47:14.220
well, this isn't a spur of the moment thing.

47:14.220 --> 47:15.740
This is clearly a real issue

47:15.740 --> 47:18.180
that this person is concerned about.

47:18.180 --> 47:20.780
Now, here's the problem though.

47:20.780 --> 47:24.660
If this person had decided to solve this problem

47:24.660 --> 47:25.540
with a sign-

47:25.540 --> 47:26.380
Yes.

47:27.900 --> 47:30.540
Then it starts to raise the issue of,

47:30.540 --> 47:32.620
if the sign's too good,

47:33.900 --> 47:35.940
at what point are you like,

47:35.940 --> 47:37.900
I don't actually need to be a part of this equation?

47:37.900 --> 47:38.740
Yeah.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.580
And that bums you out

47:39.580 --> 47:42.620
because it's like, that's what I was planning on doing today.

47:42.620 --> 47:43.980
But instead I've made,

47:43.980 --> 47:48.020
it's like a John Henry situation where I've made myself-

47:48.020 --> 47:50.540
You could just put the sign there.

47:50.540 --> 47:52.540
Just put the sign there, right?

47:52.540 --> 47:54.540
And you don't need to even be there.

47:54.540 --> 47:55.380
And that's a-

47:55.380 --> 47:57.860
But then the chance of someone being sent out

47:57.860 --> 48:01.100
of that weird side door that all fast food places have

48:01.100 --> 48:02.860
to remove the sign-

48:02.860 --> 48:06.940
Yeah, you need a defender as a steward there.

48:06.940 --> 48:08.140
I mean, if the sign is too good,

48:08.140 --> 48:09.260
you could just start to think

48:09.260 --> 48:11.740
that it is sort of corporate warfare,

48:11.740 --> 48:13.820
like somebody from Beef Journey,

48:13.820 --> 48:17.060
like trying to divert-

48:17.060 --> 48:18.540
Sorry, Beef Journey?

48:18.540 --> 48:21.140
Yeah, that's the main competitor for Steak Escape.

48:21.140 --> 48:21.980
Oh, okay, got it, got it, got it.

48:21.980 --> 48:23.900
I'm looking at the Steak Escape menu.

48:23.900 --> 48:25.660
I've eaten at this restaurant before.

48:25.660 --> 48:28.300
We used to stop off there on our way to church

48:28.300 --> 48:30.100
and get a big sandwich on the way there

48:30.100 --> 48:32.500
to help us get lots of calories, praise the Lord.

48:32.500 --> 48:37.380
And I don't remember them completely fucking

48:37.380 --> 48:39.140
going over the deep end,

48:39.140 --> 48:44.140
but they have so many different fry disasters.

48:44.820 --> 48:48.220
They have an item called Feisty Amigo Fries.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.820
Huh, I don't think that's right.

48:49.820 --> 48:51.340
It's called Feisty Amigo Fries,

48:51.340 --> 48:53.340
and it's got grilled steak, jalapenos, cheddar cheese,

48:53.340 --> 48:56.340
and Mexican seasoning, and pico de gallo,

48:56.340 --> 48:58.140
and pico de gallo, and sour cream,

48:58.140 --> 49:00.300
and somewhere in there is fries.

49:00.300 --> 49:02.740
Somewhere in there's fries, I bet.

49:02.740 --> 49:04.660
You can't just take the contents

49:04.660 --> 49:07.980
of an entirely different dish and put it on fries

49:07.980 --> 49:09.500
and say, is this anything?

49:09.500 --> 49:12.140
Yeah, oh boy, they also have something called

49:12.140 --> 49:13.500
a Teriyaki Crunch Bowl.

49:13.500 --> 49:14.820
I bet that's good.

49:14.820 --> 49:15.660
Also-

49:15.660 --> 49:16.500
I bet that's really good.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.460
Hey, everybody trying to make that fry kind of thing a thing?

49:18.460 --> 49:19.820
That's what nachos are for.

49:19.820 --> 49:22.380
They're firm, you can lift up the whole thing.

49:22.380 --> 49:25.620
A fry is a soggy boy, you can't pick up the whole thing.

49:25.620 --> 49:28.060
Let's keep it, poutine for fries, right?

49:28.060 --> 49:29.100
I'm fine with that.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.900
That's everything else on nachos.

49:30.900 --> 49:31.740
Yeah.

49:32.620 --> 49:34.340
One of the comments on this post,

49:35.300 --> 49:37.940
I got food here like three weeks ago

49:37.940 --> 49:40.240
after waiting in line an hour,

49:40.240 --> 49:42.920
ended up throwing it away, it was horrible.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.980
Billy, did you say an hour?

49:44.980 --> 49:46.220
An hour at Steak Escape?

49:46.220 --> 49:47.940
Hey, Billy, come back.

49:47.940 --> 49:49.220
Are you telling me there was a moment

49:49.220 --> 49:51.420
where you'd been waiting a half hour,

49:51.420 --> 49:54.900
and you were like, I could do this again for Steak Escape?

49:54.900 --> 49:56.980
For Steak Escape, absolutely.

49:56.980 --> 49:58.780
I'm trying to decide now which one's worse

49:58.780 --> 50:00.300
if you were in the drive-through,

50:00.300 --> 50:02.780
or if you were inside in line.

50:02.780 --> 50:04.700
Both are bad. Both are bad.

50:04.700 --> 50:07.620
Damn, they got a sandwich called the Feisty Amigo, too.

50:07.620 --> 50:09.500
It's the same toppings as the french fries.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.340
That's awesome.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.420
You gotta get them together, right?

50:11.420 --> 50:12.760
Those are the amigos.

50:12.760 --> 50:17.280
Yeah, gotta have the clutch that matches the dress.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.460
All the ones around here closed.

50:20.460 --> 50:23.300
The one on Fifth Avenue turned into a restaurant

50:23.300 --> 50:25.220
called Sabatino's, but now it's just Clams.

50:25.220 --> 50:27.700
Oh, I'm sorry, Justin, I just heard from corporate,

50:27.700 --> 50:30.540
the verbiage we're using is they escaped.

50:30.540 --> 50:31.380
They escaped.

50:32.420 --> 50:34.180
Well, the one at the mall transmogrified

50:34.180 --> 50:36.620
into a Charlie's Cheese Steaks, which is fine.

50:36.620 --> 50:37.500
It's an easy twist.

50:37.500 --> 50:38.980
Lateral move.

50:38.980 --> 50:40.420
Worse fries, better chicken tenders.

50:40.420 --> 50:41.740
They can't tell the same employees,

50:41.740 --> 50:44.940
because they already knew their way around the grill.

50:44.940 --> 50:46.600
You remember, as Steak Escape,

50:46.600 --> 50:47.620
there was a big thing there

50:47.620 --> 50:49.980
where they just had a big pile of potatoes,

50:49.980 --> 50:51.300
and then they had the crusher

50:51.300 --> 50:53.380
that would turn them into steak fries.

50:53.380 --> 50:57.500
And you would be like, exciting, chef's table.

50:57.500 --> 50:58.340
And then you're like,

50:58.340 --> 51:02.280
let me get some spicy, zany amigo fries, please.

51:02.280 --> 51:03.340
And they're like, okay.

51:03.340 --> 51:07.020
And you're like, let's see how this sausage gets made.

51:07.020 --> 51:09.200
And then you watch them shove the potato in there,

51:09.200 --> 51:11.880
and then they're like, trying to crush it.

51:11.880 --> 51:15.080
And you're like, fuck, I made them do this,

51:15.080 --> 51:17.060
this hard potato work.

51:17.060 --> 51:19.340
I hate, my name is Daniel.

51:19.340 --> 51:20.500
I work at Steak Escape,

51:20.500 --> 51:22.500
and I hate when people order the fries.

51:22.500 --> 51:27.500
The worst part of my job, when people order the fries.

51:28.580 --> 51:29.420
Definitely.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.660
That's the second worst when they order anything else.

51:32.660 --> 51:33.500
Anything else.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.200
When they bring you the feisty amigo fries

51:35.200 --> 51:37.020
just covered in flop sweat,

51:37.020 --> 51:39.140
and you're like, I'm so fucking,

51:39.140 --> 51:41.900
if I'd have known, no, it's okay.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.620
They make us crush the potatoes.

51:43.620 --> 51:46.120
I don't know why the potatoes aren't pre-crushed.

51:46.120 --> 51:47.340
That's how they do it everywhere else.

51:47.340 --> 51:49.760
It seems like a better way of doing it.

51:49.760 --> 51:50.600
They come sliced everywhere.

51:50.600 --> 51:53.980
Everywhere else, they come sliced, they come crushed.

51:53.980 --> 51:56.100
Potatoes are so firm, fuck.

51:56.100 --> 51:59.340
I also remember Steak Escape had a gigantic container

51:59.340 --> 52:02.220
of seasoned salt out there for your fries.

52:02.220 --> 52:04.380
Because if to say, we don't know what we're doing here.

52:04.380 --> 52:06.180
You have some idea.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.020
We don't know.

52:07.020 --> 52:08.060
Go for it.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.220
What a wild restaurant.

52:09.220 --> 52:12.860
And what a wild podcast it has been today,

52:12.860 --> 52:14.380
here on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

52:14.380 --> 52:15.660
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

52:15.660 --> 52:18.140
We sure enjoyed spending a little time with you.

52:18.140 --> 52:18.980
Hope your summer's going well.

52:18.980 --> 52:20.460
Oh, yeah.

52:20.460 --> 52:21.580
Yeah, buddy.

52:21.580 --> 52:23.780
I hope you're having a great time out there.

52:23.780 --> 52:25.780
Slippin' and slidin', I assume.

52:27.460 --> 52:29.900
Why are you, oh my God, why are you,

52:29.900 --> 52:32.140
my watch just keeps trying to talk to me.

52:32.140 --> 52:35.220
Justin, I'll be eating Steak Escape today.

52:35.220 --> 52:38.860
Justin, I went ahead and ordered Steak Escape on DoorDash.

52:38.860 --> 52:41.620
Order 500 sandwiches from Steak Escape.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.380
Stop, watch, watch.

52:44.220 --> 52:46.500
Start a tab at Steak Escape.

52:46.500 --> 52:49.420
If you're looking for a way to pass the summertime afternoon

52:49.420 --> 52:52.180
in a very pleasurable fashion, might I suggest

52:52.180 --> 52:56.460
the Adventure Zone Crystal Kingdom, a graphic novel,

52:56.460 --> 52:59.100
which we wrote and Carrie Peach illustrated,

52:59.100 --> 53:00.820
and it is fucking good.

53:00.820 --> 53:01.660
So good.

53:01.660 --> 53:03.340
And it's coming out July 13th.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.620
I'm not just saying that either.

53:04.620 --> 53:05.460
It's a good-

53:05.460 --> 53:07.820
And not just that, not only is it coming out on July 13th,

53:07.820 --> 53:11.080
which is tomorrow, if you're listening to this on Monday,

53:11.080 --> 53:14.340
we are also doing a live and virtual event.

53:14.340 --> 53:16.700
We've got special guests, and trust me when I say

53:16.700 --> 53:17.660
they're very special.

53:17.660 --> 53:19.500
You're going to really enjoy it.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.980
It's an absolute blast.

53:20.980 --> 53:22.580
And you can find out all the information

53:22.580 --> 53:27.580
at bit.ly slash TazGNLive2021.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.340
Get all the info there.

53:29.340 --> 53:31.340
And we have event exclusive signed book plates,

53:31.340 --> 53:33.380
which are available from our partner bookstores.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.500
More info can also be found at that bit link.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.980
And you can submit your pre-order receipt

53:37.980 --> 53:40.700
to get the pre-order gift from First Second, our publisher.

53:40.700 --> 53:43.220
It's a Kravitz lenticular laptop sticker.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.060
I will say this.

53:44.060 --> 53:46.580
If you don't know much about the book publishing world,

53:46.580 --> 53:49.340
here's what I will say to you to keep in mind.

53:49.340 --> 53:51.180
If you like this series,

53:51.180 --> 53:54.300
and you want us to be able to continue to make them,

53:54.300 --> 53:56.740
the thing that most publishers look at,

53:56.740 --> 53:59.500
and kind of the whole publishing world is built this way,

53:59.500 --> 54:03.820
is the first week of book sales.

54:03.820 --> 54:07.180
So if you could buy it the first week,

54:07.180 --> 54:08.540
or pre-order it, that works too.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.620
That would just be the coolest thing you could do.

54:10.620 --> 54:12.220
Yeah, you're so cool.

54:12.220 --> 54:14.460
We got new merch over at mcrorymerch.com,

54:14.460 --> 54:16.940
including a new pin of the month for the Gushy Wolves,

54:16.940 --> 54:20.780
which is a fantastic, just a fantastic joke

54:20.780 --> 54:23.300
from the Ether C Prologue series.

54:23.300 --> 54:25.680
And sales for that benefit the Innocence Project,

54:25.680 --> 54:27.940
which works to exonerate the wrongly convicted

54:27.940 --> 54:31.220
through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system

54:31.220 --> 54:33.020
to prevent future injustice.

54:33.020 --> 54:34.060
There's other stuff on there too.

54:34.060 --> 54:36.980
There's an It's Trash sticker from the Bim Bam TV show.

54:36.980 --> 54:38.820
There's a beautiful green stoneware mug

54:38.820 --> 54:40.400
with the Taz logo on it.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.060
There's finally some Besties merch on there.

54:43.060 --> 54:46.660
A t-shirt, if you're one of our many listeners

54:46.660 --> 54:47.500
of the Besties.

54:47.500 --> 54:49.900
So check all that out.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.100
And speaking of Adventure Zone,

54:51.100 --> 54:54.060
the first episode of the new season,

54:54.060 --> 54:56.520
Ether C is out now, we've been doing the prologue,

54:56.520 --> 54:59.580
but now this is the first episode of the regular season.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.300
That's up now.

55:01.300 --> 55:03.020
I do some streaming on Twitch,

55:03.020 --> 55:04.940
twitch.tv slash the Travis Macro,

55:04.940 --> 55:05.900
if you wanna check that out.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.420
We've got a YouTube channel, Macro Family,

55:08.420 --> 55:10.820
a lot of fun stuff on there.

55:10.820 --> 55:13.140
And this is just a personal plug from me to you.

55:13.140 --> 55:14.260
Check out the Besties.

55:14.260 --> 55:15.500
It's one of my favorite podcasts.

55:15.500 --> 55:16.900
I listen every week.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.100
I learn a lot about video games.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.460
It's my brothers, as well as Resh Freshtrick

55:21.460 --> 55:23.000
and Chris Plant.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.940
It is one of my favorite podcasts.

55:24.940 --> 55:25.780
Go check it out.

55:25.780 --> 55:26.620
Thanks, Trapp.

55:26.620 --> 55:28.460
And thanks to Montane for the Use for a Theme song.

55:28.460 --> 55:30.580
My life is better with you.

55:30.580 --> 55:32.140
If you follow Montane on Twitter,

55:32.140 --> 55:34.660
you've probably gotten some tips and hints

55:34.660 --> 55:37.020
about some movement.

55:37.020 --> 55:42.020
Let's just say some movement in the music publishing world

55:42.460 --> 55:44.860
vis-a-vis this song and you hearing it

55:44.860 --> 55:46.740
and seeing a music video for it.

55:46.740 --> 55:48.260
So that's all great.

55:48.260 --> 55:49.140
Thank you, Montane.

55:49.140 --> 55:50.780
And thanks Max Fun for having us on the network.

55:50.780 --> 55:51.700

55:51.700 --> 55:53.340

55:53.340 --> 55:54.220
I'm sorry I called it shit.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.060
It's not shit.

55:55.060 --> 55:55.900
It's good podcasts.

55:55.900 --> 55:56.780
Let's hear it, Griffin.

55:56.780 --> 55:57.620
Let's hear that final yahoo.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.220
This one was sent in by Davin.

56:00.220 --> 56:05.220
And Davin sent it in and it was sent in today.

56:05.820 --> 56:06.660
Oh, fuck.

56:06.660 --> 56:08.460
Today, this morning.

56:08.460 --> 56:11.220
It's a yahoo answers from,

56:11.220 --> 56:14.340
and this one was asked by Batman.

56:14.340 --> 56:15.180
Ooh.

56:15.180 --> 56:16.020
Asks.

56:19.060 --> 56:20.340
Batman asks,

56:24.380 --> 56:27.260
does anyone know where to,

56:28.140 --> 56:31.580
does anyone do any repairs?

56:31.580 --> 56:36.580
Does anyone know where to get repairs done on my dad?

56:40.180 --> 56:42.020
Does anyone know where to get that?

56:42.020 --> 56:45.420
Does anyone know a good dad repair shop in Houston, Texas?

56:47.620 --> 56:49.740
I thought he was toast to McElroy.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:51.580 --> 56:52.500
This has been my brother, my brother,

56:52.500 --> 56:54.580
may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

56:54.580 --> 57:03.480
One, it's better with you.

57:03.480 --> 57:06.180
It's better, it's better with you.

57:06.180 --> 57:07.100
It's better with you.

57:07.100 --> 57:10.080
My life, end by Von Michael,

57:10.080 --> 57:12.300
it's not got the better with you.

57:12.300 --> 57:16.180
It's the truer, it's better, it's better with two.

57:16.180 --> 57:18.180
It's better with you

57:18.180 --> 57:19.300
My life

57:19.300 --> 57:23.640
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

57:23.640 --> 57:50.640
It's better with you
