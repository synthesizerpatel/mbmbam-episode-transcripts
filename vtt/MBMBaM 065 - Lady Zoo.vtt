00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.800
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.520
I am your host, Justin McElroy. I am co-host Travis McElroy.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.520
I'm Cocoa host, Cocoa McElroy. Hi, Cocoa.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.600
Hey, this is Cocoa. So today, we're going to kick things off.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.320
I've given everyone an assignment. We're going to put the debt ceiling on the old

01:06.320 --> 01:10.720
comedy juicer and just kind of see what comes out.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.240
See what kind of jokes we came up with. Now, I like my comedy pulpy, so I'm definitely

01:16.240 --> 01:19.040
going to go with a Boehner sounds like boner joke.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.000
Travis, what do you feel like? I like puns, so I'm going to say my debt

01:24.000 --> 01:28.960
ceiling has a sunroof. Your debt ceiling has a sunroof? Okay.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.080
That sounds more like the origins of a shitty political cartoon.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.280
What I was going to go with is something a little more man of the people.

01:37.280 --> 01:42.400
I was going to say, I don't know about the debt ceiling, but I've certainly reached my

01:42.400 --> 01:45.920
give a shit ceiling, and then I was going to go, a twang.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.600
If someone could provide that sound effect for me, that would be great, too.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.400
Is that a spittoon sound you just made? No, it's like a twang.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.280
Like a banjo riff? It's more like a twang.

02:02.720 --> 02:10.080
It's like you've released a bow and arrow. It's like HTML, but instead of saying the

02:10.080 --> 02:16.880
previous text was emphasized or italics, it says the previous text had a twang to it.

02:16.880 --> 02:21.120
So it's like HTML for speech. Talk to email, yes.

02:21.120 --> 02:24.480
Talk to email. I like that. I like that a lot.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.120
When I'm using it for jokes, I call it ha TML. It's about comedy.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.240
How about HTMLOL? We would also accept HTMLOL.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.160
I was just sitting here trying to think of flash base puns.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.160
I don't think this episode is off to a great start.

02:40.160 --> 02:45.600
No. Flash mob puns are much easier. Hey, everybody, can we stop with that?

02:46.480 --> 02:49.840
Can you just stop? Flash mobs were in a Sprint commercial,

02:49.840 --> 02:53.680
so that's pretty much done. So you gotta move on to something else.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.480
Flash mobs are those things where a bunch of young kids go and beat the shit out of people?

02:58.480 --> 03:00.800
That's correct. This is free advice for flash mobs.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.640
How the fuck was that in a Sprint? Like,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.920
hey, I'm so glad we could meet and get here and beat up this cop

03:05.920 --> 03:08.880
because we texted on our Sprint phones. No, that's not like that.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.320
Flash mobs are when young people get together and just dance,

03:12.320 --> 03:15.920
but it's choreographed and they don't- And all of a sudden it's like at 12.01,

03:15.920 --> 03:21.520
everybody dance. I mean, basically it's like insane people have been doing for years,

03:21.520 --> 03:26.480
the insane homeless running up people's- Only slightly less organized and way less interesting.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.160
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.360
I think there's nothing more interesting than a group of young kids coming to,

03:31.360 --> 03:34.320
like, break both your legs on the street. No, it's not-

03:34.320 --> 03:38.880
Why is yours all about violence? It's not like a mob like soccer hooligans.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.960
That was used inappropriately. True flash mobs are about dancing.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.480
Now, okay, will I agree with you that that would be a better use of the word flash mob?

03:46.480 --> 03:50.800
Of course. Of course that would be a better use of it. It would make a lot more sense

03:50.800 --> 03:54.000
because what they're doing is flash dance. It's not a flash mob.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.200
Maybe because flash dance is already taken.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.880
Across this great country of ours,

03:58.880 --> 04:04.160
how many show choir ensembles do you think have named themselves the flash mob?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.640
And they were like a bunch of sequins.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.600
I think it's the kids inside the show choir.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.920
There's like a splinter cell inside them that do things their own way.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.080
You know what I mean? They're plotting the overthrow.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.800
They wear their reversible vests inside out.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.280
So you're saying by day, they all sing,

04:27.280 --> 04:29.920
we built this city in a choreographed dance.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.640
And at night, they tear it down.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.760
By night, they wander around town and beat the shit out of cops.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.320
No, there's no- Again, Jesus Christ. Let's move on to the questions

04:38.320 --> 04:40.320
because I feel like you're going to grok those a little bit better.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.720
I'm going off to college soon and I'm going to be meeting a lot of new people.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.360
When I meet another guy, naturally, we shake hands,

04:47.360 --> 04:52.880
but what's an appropriate greeting for a stranger of the opposite gender?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.400
Greetings in Georgia.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.080
Oh, that's a great question.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.480
That's a really good question because I don't know what to tell you.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.560
Well, in Georgia, don't you delicately dab your handkerchief

05:04.560 --> 05:06.960
to your forehead and wave your lacy fan?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.800
Uh-huh, right.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.000
You sip your mint julep and you talk about your land

05:12.000 --> 05:15.040
and how good it is to have it fertile.

05:15.040 --> 05:15.920
Do a little snuff.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.160
Just a little snus.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.240
I've experienced this a lot in my industry

05:24.160 --> 05:29.680
where you'll meet a woman who is in PR, perhaps, or marketing

05:29.680 --> 05:31.520
who you have never met before in real life

05:31.520 --> 05:33.520
and you'll go for the handshake and she'll go for the hug.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.160
And boy, howdy. It's that awkward.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.880
Because that's what you can end up doing,

05:38.880 --> 05:41.520
is putting an open hand right between her boobs.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.560
That's how it shakes out.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.480
So what you're saying is it's-

05:46.480 --> 05:49.600
Not like you touch, but it looks like you're indicating to her.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.920
Yeah, like, hey, can I dive in there?

05:51.920 --> 05:52.400
What's up?

05:53.440 --> 05:58.000
You got to make a bigger opening bet than the person you're greeting.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.160
Because if they're going for a handshake,

06:00.160 --> 06:01.840
if they're going for a handshake, you have to go for a hug.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.320
If they're going for a hug, kiss them on the cheek.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.120
If they go for a cheek kiss, which is coming back and-

06:07.120 --> 06:08.240
You tongue them in the mouth.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.720
Tongue them in the mouth. They go for that? Marry them.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.280
Hi.

06:11.280 --> 06:11.840
I love you.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.760
Can we- What about just a big old flashy bow?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.840
You sweep your cape to the side.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.480
A pleasure, I'm sure.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.120
Greetings.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.680
I am Voldemort.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.040
No, your name is actually Brian.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.360
Pleasure.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.960
I am Dracula.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.920
So glad to have you working at my quiz-nose.

06:45.280 --> 06:52.960
Have you been to that one quiz-nose out Route 60 where the guy says he's Dracula?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.520
Whatever you do, don't ask for garlic.

06:56.080 --> 06:56.960
He will flip.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.200
He will flip his mind.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.520
I think handshaking-

07:01.520 --> 07:02.240
That's the thing, though.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.160
The problem is that this isn't just a gender question.

07:06.160 --> 07:06.960
I think that this is-

07:07.840 --> 07:12.880
We've lost that kind of universal etiquette of greeting.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.480
Back in the 1800s, it used to be so structured and like,

07:16.480 --> 07:17.280
this is what you do.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.200
Yeah, codify for it fully.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.960
You kiss the back of the hand.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.440
You bow.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.280
Across the board, there was a rule for it.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.960
Now it's so up in the air.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.480
Please don't kiss the back of my hand.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.760
Please don't do that.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.640
Don't do that.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.360
Don't do that.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.280
It's still pretty structured, I think.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.360
I think we're making a mountain out of a molehill here.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.800
I think you just shake the hand.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.160
Because I can't think of anything else you do except for hugging,

07:40.160 --> 07:41.600
and that's kind of weird to do.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.680
That's a good goodbye to a stranger.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.800
I like to drop that like,

07:44.800 --> 07:48.800
hey, our relationship's moving faster than you thought it was.

07:48.800 --> 07:57.600
But if you defy the greeting convention and you kiss a hand or bow

07:57.600 --> 08:02.800
or do the, what is it, the like, the French cheek kiss?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.000
Well, there's gotta be a proper name for that.

08:04.000 --> 08:04.720
A genuflect.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.400
Just douche-chill city.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.080
Just, that's just.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.080
The only way you can.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.280
Any of those things are bad.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.640
You can take a shot.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.960
I mean, like, you're not gonna go wrong.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.680
If you think about like the,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.600
and we're mainly talking about the hug shake,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.960
like that dichotomy there.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.240
You're not gonna go wrong.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.440
I would rather be on the handshake end of that

08:29.440 --> 08:31.760
than the hug end of that, by which I mean.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.040
You mean you go for the handshake.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.880
If you're not sure, go handshake.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.000
If you wanna gamble and go with hug,

08:39.360 --> 08:40.800
if it's your first time meeting somebody

08:40.800 --> 08:43.200
but you've kind of talked to them in the past,

08:43.200 --> 08:43.760
you know what I mean?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.920
Like maybe that's very common in our society now.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.560
You've talked to someone via email or via phone

08:48.560 --> 08:52.080
and this is your first time meeting in the meet space, as we say.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.520
If you look in the eyes and there's that recognition,

08:55.520 --> 08:57.040
maybe you go in for the hug.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.400
Still gonna be a gamble.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.440
When you do the hug, you got about one to two seconds

09:01.440 --> 09:03.200
of contact and then you gotta break off.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.240
No expanded hugs.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.120
Pat, pat, then you're out.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.560
Total stranger's gotta be a handshake.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.520
Got to be a handshake.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.400
Gotta be a handshake.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
Now, here's another question.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.960
Let's do another level.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.880
Let's go to sleep in Inception Machine

09:14.880 --> 09:15.920
and go another level down.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.120
When you shake a fellow's hand

09:19.120 --> 09:20.640
and it's a contemporary,

09:20.640 --> 09:24.720
and not your boss, I almost always go for the three pump.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.800
Like, uh, uh, like, uh, and then maybe bones it,

09:28.800 --> 09:30.400
but usually I don't bones it.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.760
I just go in and then go thumbsies and then nucks

09:33.760 --> 09:34.880
and then pull it back.

09:34.880 --> 09:35.440
Yeah.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.280
Can you do that to a lady stranger?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.360
Or do you, how do you shake a lady's hand?

09:39.360 --> 09:40.160
I think with a lady stranger.

09:40.160 --> 09:40.880
How do you shake a lady's hand?

09:40.880 --> 09:41.280
Here's my thing.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.520
How do you shake a lady's hand without breaking it?

09:43.520 --> 09:44.160
Without hurting it?

09:44.160 --> 09:48.080
I think you just give like one squeeze and you're out.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.440
Like you just, you're out.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.920
Like you just grasp and stop.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.880
I don't think you pump.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.000
I don't think you do nucks.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.200
I don't think you bones it.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.640
I just squeeze it out.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.600
Some ladies are so delicate though.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.320
They're like, you go to shake their hand

10:02.320 --> 10:06.160
and it's like, it's like a bunch of glass sticks wrapped in silk.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.120
Like how am I supposed to shake this?

10:07.120 --> 10:10.320
It's like grabbing a bunch of, grabbing a bunch of tulips by the head.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.200
Yeah, exactly.

10:11.840 --> 10:16.400
And I tell you, there's a, there's a whole social hierarchy

10:16.400 --> 10:18.000
for guys in handshakes too.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.920
We were at a family gathering this weekend

10:19.920 --> 10:21.840
and I met a new member of our family

10:21.840 --> 10:25.280
and he shook my hand with a sort of bravado maybe.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.520
That made me say like, hey, this guy is somebody you got to take seriously.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.020
Yeah.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.080
Yeah.

10:32.080 --> 10:38.400
Now some, now some, I'm not saying like all ladies hands are silk wrapped glass sticks,

10:38.400 --> 10:41.360
but I'm saying like, it's hard sometimes

10:41.360 --> 10:45.440
that you don't feel that sort of the meaty warmth you expect.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.840
I think when you shake a lady's hand, it's not a competition.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.320
You're not trying to, as opposed to the dude where it's like,

10:50.320 --> 10:51.680
I can give a firm handshake.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.440
I am a man with a woman.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.240
I think you don't need to crush her fingers.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.280
Don't be an asshole.

10:57.280 --> 11:02.160
You guys know that because of this bit, every time we do a live show

11:02.160 --> 11:07.680
and we meet our one to two lady fans, they are gonna fucking break our hands.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.640
Oh, crush it.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.600
Oh, fuck.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.120
Yeah, but we'll deserve it and we'll understand it.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.640
Mm-hmm.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.920
Guys, everybody, let's just chest bump.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.600
Can we all just chest bump?

11:21.600 --> 11:24.960
Just get back to basics and just bump our chests together.

11:24.960 --> 11:29.200
Hey, dear brothers McElroy, I'm worried that I might be in love with my best friend's ex.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.480
I understand the rule is bros before hoes.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.080
Please don't say that out loud.

11:34.080 --> 11:34.560
Mm-hmm.

11:34.560 --> 11:40.560
But when it is considered acceptable to proceed with getting my Mac on, form spring.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.160
Never.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.160
It's never bros before hoes.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.760
Hey, hey, whoever said bros before hoes is lying.

11:49.200 --> 11:53.440
Meet exhibit A in the fact that the world does not operate on that premise.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.560
I call it the continued existence and propagation of the human race.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.720
Hi, it's never been bros before hoes until your bros learn to make progeny.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.000
Do you know who invented bros before hoes?

12:07.040 --> 12:11.120
It was somebody who knew that his friend was interested in his own ex-girlfriend.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.240
Yeah.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.400
He's like, hey, wait, but you, uh, uh.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.520
Bros before hoes.

12:15.520 --> 12:15.840
Yeah.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.720
Gotcha.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.360
I did it.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.680
Um, came down from the mount.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.640
There's a stone carved bros before hoes.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.960
I have, I have, um, uh, a, a, another example.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.720
If you say bros before hoes in front of a quote unquote hoe,

12:32.720 --> 12:37.360
it'll be bros and just bros forever and ever and jerking it forever.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.800
Cause like, what are you doing?

12:38.800 --> 12:39.920
Don't say that out loud.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.280
Don't even think it.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.440
Like, what is it with that attitude?

12:43.440 --> 12:44.800
Bros before hoes.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.960
Like, have you met your bros?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.640
It's, it's, it's absolute nonsense.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.840
It's nonsense.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.240
Can we make a-

12:50.240 --> 12:51.760
It's just falderol.

12:51.760 --> 12:57.920
Can we make a less, uh, falderoli, uh, less, um, inflammatory version of this?

12:57.920 --> 12:58.400
Yes.

12:58.400 --> 12:58.800
Yes.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.840
Pals before gals.

13:00.400 --> 13:00.640
Okay.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.120
That's, that's perfect.

13:03.120 --> 13:03.920
That's much better.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.200
I thought we could get a good 15 or 20 seconds of riffing out of that,

13:07.200 --> 13:08.560
but you just don't shut it down.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.520
I just, that's right now.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.480
Pals before gals.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.160
Everybody, no more bros before hoes.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.760
I'm going to do a slight addendum to one of our usual answers.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.560
Uh, and it's this.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.880
Just ask him, silly.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.120
Hey.

13:19.680 --> 13:19.840
Hey.

13:20.640 --> 13:23.360
Go to your best friend and be like, hey, you're my best friend.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.480
You want me to be happy.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.200
Um, can I put it in Debbie?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.200
Can I put it in her?

13:30.400 --> 13:34.240
Um, can we, how about buds before jugs?

13:35.680 --> 13:35.920
What?

13:36.560 --> 13:39.120
I got, Griff and I already did this part.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.320
Buds before jugs.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.600
I did this part for you.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.040
I wanted to make my contribution just since it's democracy and people can vote.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.960
We'll pretend I haven't already nailed it.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.080
Griffin, you've got, you've got buds.

13:50.080 --> 13:50.800
Is it buds?

13:50.800 --> 13:51.200
I'm sorry.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.960
Is it buds before jugs?

13:53.520 --> 13:54.880
Is that your rhyming?

13:54.880 --> 13:55.600
Okay.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.000
Travis.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.840
We have to find some way to, to say that the first one is, is guys.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.920
Cause pals can be lady.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.040
I have lady pals.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.240
Do you think, so you don't like how mine's more progressive?

14:08.240 --> 14:10.080
Oh, you're sick.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.600
What if your best friend's a lady?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.040
I twisted it on you.

14:13.040 --> 14:13.920
What's up?

14:13.920 --> 14:14.320
Yeah.

14:14.320 --> 14:18.800
Mine was not only less offensive, it also elevated all of humanity's dialogue.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.080
So did you have something else you would like it had?

14:22.080 --> 14:22.960
You took the game.

14:22.960 --> 14:27.520
I would like to look into the future a hundred years, uh, when we can just say human beings

14:27.520 --> 14:28.560
before human beings.

14:29.840 --> 14:35.200
Actually that'd be human beings before human beans, which were created in a terrible Dr.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.480
Moreau style.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.160
Don't date your best friend's ex.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.640
He says.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.120
Period.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.800
Don't, sorry, what is it again?

14:46.160 --> 14:49.600
Do not, do not date your best friend's ex or, or buds before jugs.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.320
Which one did you want?

14:50.320 --> 14:51.360
Which one of my bone moles?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.160
Which one of these pearls?

14:54.160 --> 14:57.120
I'll just open up another Griffin fortune cookie and see what spits out.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.640
Buds before jugs it says.

15:00.640 --> 15:05.120
Listen, you can't like, she's just going to compare you to him.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.080
Comfy with that?

15:06.080 --> 15:11.520
The thing that's weird about this is that that I think it's, I'm less concerned about

15:11.520 --> 15:14.320
the, your friend giving permission and everything.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.400
I'm less concerned about that.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.600
More concerned about how your life, should you pursue this relationship is going to splinter

15:21.600 --> 15:22.960
in a very real way.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.920
Like you are creating, you're basically creating a splinter reality for yourself.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.520
Civil war is what you're creating.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.000
Yes.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.200
You're creating a civil war.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.720
Bro's against hoes.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.280
Rebels versus rebels before redcoats.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.280
I just, that was the revolutionary war.

15:44.080 --> 15:44.560
Okay.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.120
Rebels.

15:45.120 --> 15:45.440
I'm sorry.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.280
Is it rebels before redcoats?

15:47.280 --> 15:52.240
Here's the problem with this is that if you do this, there's no way your best friend is

15:52.240 --> 15:59.520
going to be able to divorce from his mind the idea that you were, you were into his

15:59.520 --> 16:00.560
girlfriend while they were dating.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.200
No way to do it, no way to do it.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.480
And that's it for you guys.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.720
That's pretty much the, that's pretty much the old ball game.

16:08.400 --> 16:14.160
Once he plants that seed and the fertile, fertile loam of his jealous mind, you're done.

16:14.160 --> 16:21.760
So I guess like to sum it all up, you can do it, but it will irreparably change your

16:21.760 --> 16:22.800
friendship forever.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.600
And by change means end.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.960
So yeah, kind of like how a building works.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.320
Kind of like how a building when burned down is changed.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.120
Back to not building.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.880
Back to zero building left.

16:37.680 --> 16:43.680
Love is, I would say that there's very, there's a, there are almost no situations where I

16:43.680 --> 16:46.640
say don't pursue love.

16:47.280 --> 16:52.240
I just want you to know that you are the risks that you are talking about here.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.080
That's all.

16:54.080 --> 17:00.000
And, and it also, and I think X is a little, I think we almost need more information to

17:00.000 --> 17:01.680
really decide.

17:01.680 --> 17:01.920
Yeah.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.560
If they just broke up like two days ago, fuck you.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.960
Or if it was like a two week relationship though.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.200
Yeah.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.640
Like what if they just casually saw each other and then you just said fuck you at him for

17:10.640 --> 17:11.040
nothing.

17:11.040 --> 17:11.840
That's fine then.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.680
You just yelled at him.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.720
Well, now I feel bad.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.600
You should feel bad.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.840
You don't spring the conclusions.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.400
Peruse before abuse.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.120
That's what I say.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.000
That's my other one that I've got.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.400
Griffin.

17:24.960 --> 17:25.200
Hey.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.000
Hey.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.280
This Yahoo answer was sent in by CurlyHeadPoet.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.720
Thank you CurlyHeadPoet.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.280
Thanks buddy.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.200
Thanks friendo.

17:33.200 --> 17:40.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user um who asks, what to do with my pubes and pit hair heart?

17:43.280 --> 17:44.640
Should I braid them?

17:44.640 --> 17:45.200
Curl them?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.400
I have a hot date tomorrow.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.400
My pubes and armpit hair need to be gorgeous.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.600
Just smile face.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.120
Just as long as they match.

17:53.120 --> 17:53.680
Yeah, right.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.720
Don't do one thing up top and a different thing downstairs.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.960
Consistency is key.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.320
I think that you can I think I'm saying that I think that you can mix it up.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.760
I think you can go I think you can go bouffant and armpit left.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.680
I think you can go cornrows and armpit right and pubes.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.760
I think that you can shave your basketball number.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.840
I'm saying that's a good look.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.720
That's not just a good look.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.560
That's three good looks.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.640
Oh, so you want what you want to emphasize on this day is variety.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.080
I have a lot of different things.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.200
Welcome to the buffet.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.480
What do you feel like today?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.800
I got all kinds of weird shit in here.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.200
What if and I do a lot of bad things.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.840
This would take a lot of patience and some skill.

18:33.840 --> 18:38.800
But what if you raise up your right arm and there's a rhino in there and in your left arm

18:38.800 --> 18:42.720
it's one of those swirly tree looking things and you see some topiaries all over the place.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.160
Oh, you didn't mean like a literal rhinoceros.

18:46.160 --> 18:46.660
No.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.480
That'd be difficult to get up in there and have.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.000
We're trying to watch a movie.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.400
Can you please keep your giant horned mammal quiet?

18:58.400 --> 19:01.760
Can you keep your pet rhino just silenced?

19:02.880 --> 19:05.040
That'd be a pretty cool commercial for deodorant, wouldn't it?

19:07.840 --> 19:08.800
Can you walk me through it?

19:08.800 --> 19:10.000
Can you walk me through the visuals?

19:10.000 --> 19:10.720
It's a storyboard.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.320
No, I'll just do sound.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.200
Okay, what's your underarm situation like?

19:15.200 --> 19:17.440
That's the rhino.

19:17.440 --> 19:23.600
It's like you gotta slam it down with some axe paste and they smear the axe paste on the rhino

19:23.600 --> 19:24.880
and he shrinks down.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.920
Okay, maybe the rhino's in a stained t-shirt and he's eating nachos.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.300
Okay.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.120
I mean, I don't know why we...

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Seriously, he's like a sloppy rhino.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.240
He's not one of those well-manicured caped rhinos you see in Georgia.

19:42.240 --> 19:47.920
Can we dye our miscellaneous hairs?

19:47.920 --> 19:48.960
Tie-dye, maybe?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.440
Can we tie-dye them?

19:51.440 --> 19:55.920
That only says, I'm taking the care to get a cool look for you.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.760
It says, very flexible up here.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.280
I don't know what's going on.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.240
Brian, I'm having a good time.

20:02.240 --> 20:07.360
We're both in a situation where I can see your armpit hair, so it's got to be intimate.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.000
So straight up though, hold on.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.040
Let me pause just a second because is that cotton candy?

20:15.360 --> 20:16.400
What have you done?

20:16.400 --> 20:17.360
How could you do this?

20:17.360 --> 20:19.200
If so, can I get some?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.240
Can I get a nibble?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.280
Is it blueberry?

20:21.280 --> 20:21.840
Yes, please.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.880
I don't like the idea of people having hair anywhere.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.360
Even guys, I don't want to think about it, that reality.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.920
I just want people to have it and keep it to themselves.

20:33.920 --> 20:40.640
Wait, you're uncomfortable with the idea of body hair other than the kind on your head area?

20:41.360 --> 20:44.800
I'm not uncomfortable with the fact that it exists.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.960
I'm uncomfortable with it being brought into the discourse.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.280
I'm actually more uncomfortable with the idea that there are people out there

20:51.280 --> 20:55.040
that are impressed with how well-manicured your armpit hair is.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.800
I don't think those people exist.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.080
No, I think this gentleman has invented the situation for himself.

21:00.080 --> 21:04.080
I don't think there's anything wrong with being proud of your puberty, Bush, though.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.160
You don't think hair is sinful?

21:09.280 --> 21:13.120
Well, I mean, it is a sin to have hair on your mom's pupus.

21:13.120 --> 21:17.600
But listen, it just makes it sweeter.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.200
Oh, yeah?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.720
Yeah, it's the sweetest sin.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.400
The sweetest sin is having hair on above your genitals?

21:24.400 --> 21:30.560
Uh-huh, I just think that it's time for us to be proud of our bodies fully,

21:30.560 --> 21:33.360
wholly, internally, externally.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.840
You're saying, ladies, stop shaving.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.600
I'm saying, ladies, gentlemen, no more maintenance.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.320
No more, you know how many hours in the day you have before you die?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.440
Not a lot, not as many as you might think.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.720
Let it all run wild, let it all hang out.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.560
So let's just Sasquatch it up.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.200
Yeah, and you know Griffin is living this lifestyle

21:55.200 --> 21:58.560
because he uses his shampoo suds to wash his body.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.560
So you know that he's committed to this.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.000
Groom Free is the name of this movement that he has initiated,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.800
and he wants everybody to get on board with him.

22:08.800 --> 22:14.080
Why don't you spend that hour writing some poetry instead of noosing?

22:14.080 --> 22:22.720
Uncle Jesse. I guarantee you if they have a full-blown, poorly maintained situation,

22:22.720 --> 22:25.360
they write some poetry from time to time.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.400
They indulge in some creative writing.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.360
You know, if Uncle Jesse had spent half as much time

22:31.360 --> 22:33.840
trying to get a fan base for Jesse and the Rippers

22:33.840 --> 22:39.360
as he has spent moosing, blow drying, conditioning, endlessly styling his hair,

22:39.360 --> 22:41.280
that could have been a very different series.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.280
It would have been about his meteoric rise to stardom. Think about it.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.360
Full house, think about it.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.960
Hey, I got a question for you guys.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.840
Is it possible to ask out a pizza girl?

22:53.840 --> 22:59.120
Or more importantly, should you ask out a pizza girl?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.360
Mystified in Melbourne.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.200
I think those are two different questions.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.560
Is it possible? Yes.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.440
Wait, should you?

23:05.440 --> 23:06.880
No, I think he means successfully.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.160
Can you close the ask out?

23:08.160 --> 23:09.440
Oh, well, that's a different question.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.520
Here's my biggest thing.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.520
That sounds gross.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.520
Is this a girl made of pizza?

23:19.200 --> 23:26.240
Because I think if she could find someone to love her and not eat her,

23:26.240 --> 23:27.840
she should count herself lucky.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.440
And you know what?

23:29.440 --> 23:30.880
I don't care what people say.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.120
Yes, you can ask out a pizza girl.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.720
And you know what?

23:34.720 --> 23:38.080
Yeah, you should ask out a pizza girl if you love her.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.560
And if you think she's something special to you.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.560
If she has the toppings that she likes.

23:42.560 --> 23:42.960
If you like-

23:42.960 --> 23:44.640
This is my supreme girlfriend.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.400
Hey, you are supreme.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.720
I'm a meat-

23:48.720 --> 23:50.320
I don't care that you're a little bit big.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.040
I'm a meat lover.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.320
I'm a meat lover lover.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.200
That's me.

23:53.200 --> 23:53.840
I love you.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.880
You're a meat lover's pizza.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.480
I'm a meat lover's pizza lover.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.280
Meat lover lover.

23:57.840 --> 23:58.320
That's me.

23:58.880 --> 23:59.680
That's who I am.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.160
You are covered in sardines.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.080
What?

24:04.080 --> 24:07.360
I am crying and it's not because of your freshly diced onions.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.120
It's because I love you so much.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.520
You are so special to me.

24:12.160 --> 24:12.800
Pizza girl.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.880
Pizza girl.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.800
That's my favorite Ed Milkman song, by the way.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.680
You guys should check it out.

24:18.720 --> 24:23.600
So assuming he means a pizza delivery woman, I think they prefer-

24:24.160 --> 24:25.200
They don't let girls do that job.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.160
They don't let girls do that job.

24:26.160 --> 24:26.720
You gotta be real.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.360
All woman.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.480
I think no, because there's this inherent laziness that's like,

24:32.480 --> 24:34.240
is this a girl delivery service?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.280
It is not.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.360
She is just bringing you food.

24:37.360 --> 24:42.080
I am going to say no, because when someone is on delivery to a stranger's house in a

24:42.080 --> 24:45.040
strange neighborhood, they're already on high alert.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.400
And I think that that is not the right time to ask them how.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.320
When they're terrified?

24:50.320 --> 24:50.560
Yeah.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.200
They're prepared to like open the door to like an S&M cult or something.

24:55.200 --> 24:55.760
You know what I mean?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.400
Like they're already afraid.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.600
An S&M cult?

24:59.600 --> 25:00.000
You think?

25:00.000 --> 25:00.240
Yeah.

25:01.200 --> 25:01.520
Yeah.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.760
Is that what they're prepared to open the door to?

25:03.760 --> 25:05.920
Have you ever been a delivery person?

25:05.920 --> 25:06.720
Either one of you.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.120
No.

25:07.120 --> 25:07.760
No.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.320
I have.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.840
And you walked in on an S&M cult.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.200
They're like, oh, Jimmy John's.

25:11.200 --> 25:11.600
Thank you.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.040
Hey, get out of-

25:13.040 --> 25:16.160
Hey, can you get out of me for a second so I can pay this man for the Jimmy John's?

25:18.080 --> 25:21.840
Could you undo my mouth zippers so I can eat this delicious submarine sandwich?

25:21.840 --> 25:23.520
Oh, I left my wallet with the gimp.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.080
Go get him.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.080
Hey, Daniel, can you plug my gape for a second so I can walk to the front door?

25:30.080 --> 25:35.200
I'm trying- I got to get to the door and pay the Jimmy John's guy, but you're standing on my balls.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.680
Um, here's- I can only see one way that we can test this out because I'm still on the fence.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.040
Okay.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.640
We got to role play it.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.000
I think we just got to keep going until we find if it is-

25:50.800 --> 25:51.200
If it is-

25:51.200 --> 25:51.440
Okay.

25:51.440 --> 26:00.160
... we can do, so I'll be pizza girl, and, um, Travis, you can be the lonely customer,

26:00.160 --> 26:02.480
and then, uh, we'll trade off if need be.

26:03.360 --> 26:03.760
Okay.

26:03.760 --> 26:04.960
So, uh, I ring-

26:04.960 --> 26:05.440
Travis, go.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.880
... ring the doorbell, and-

26:06.880 --> 26:08.960
I'll adjudicate, and I'll let you know when the situation's-

26:08.960 --> 26:10.160
Okay, just narrate, and we'll-

26:10.160 --> 26:10.720
Okay.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.440
All right.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.320
So, ding dong.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.120
Hey, I got a pizza here for you.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.240
Well, thank you.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.760
Uh, you're awfully cute.

26:21.760 --> 26:22.400
Bye!

26:22.400 --> 26:23.280
I want to go to the-

26:25.920 --> 26:27.360
Oh, it was a good try.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.080
It was a good try.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.760
Um, Travis needs to go play some more, be comfortable talking to women, I think.

26:32.320 --> 26:32.560
Yeah.

26:33.120 --> 26:41.200
Uh, hey, the, uh, my- my problem with this is the same problem I have with asking out a bank teller,

26:41.200 --> 26:43.360
in that they're trapped.

26:43.360 --> 26:43.840
Like, it's a-

26:43.840 --> 26:44.080
Yeah.

26:44.080 --> 26:48.000
That's a girl- you're just asking her out because she's a girl in a glass cage

26:48.000 --> 26:50.560
that you're asking her out because it's perfectly safe.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.560
Like, don't- don't do that.

26:52.560 --> 26:57.760
If you want to be serious about it, follow her back at a- at a distance she won't see you.

26:57.760 --> 26:58.320
Well-

26:58.320 --> 27:02.640
Follow her back to pizza joint, and then wait until she's getting out of her car,

27:02.640 --> 27:06.560
and just as she's about to get out of her car, slam the car door back closed,

27:06.560 --> 27:09.040
and then make her roll down her window, and then ask her out.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.120
Because that says, to me, romance.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.520
I, um, it sounds- smells to me like a felony.

27:15.520 --> 27:23.840
I like your idea that banks are lady zoos.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.000
That's what they are.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.200
They're lady zoos.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.600
You go through the drive-thru, you get to see a lady.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.200
You pay your deposit, you pay your APR,

27:34.720 --> 27:36.560
and you get to see ladies in prison.

27:36.560 --> 27:44.080
Yeah, anybody could use an automatic teller machine for anything.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.440
You know why you don't?

27:45.440 --> 27:49.040
It's because you're gonna go see a lady in a prison, and you're gonna think,

27:49.040 --> 27:50.240
oh, I should ask her out.

27:50.240 --> 27:55.680
You're gonna treat yourself to a little midday alternate reality fantasy about this girl,

27:55.680 --> 27:57.120
but you're- just stop it.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.720
Just go use the teller machine.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.880
Why do you want an extra interaction?

28:00.880 --> 28:01.440
I don't get it.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.360
I don't get it.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.280
So I think somewhere in there, we've decided it's not a good idea to ask out your pizza girl.

28:07.280 --> 28:12.480
I think we've decided that anybody in any service industry, you should not- you should not court-

28:12.480 --> 28:13.280
You shouldn't.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.560
Leave them alone, they're working.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.520
Leave them alone.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.200
Can't you just leave them alone?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.080
I'll tell you what, here's the message you're sending.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.840
Let's talk about first impressions for a second.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.440
You order a pizza, so this person knows two things about you.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.800
One, you pay for it.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.160
And two, you don't cook.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.400
So that's not like a-

28:32.400 --> 28:32.960
Not a good start.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.320
That's not a good scene.

28:34.320 --> 28:35.520
No, it's not a good start.

28:35.520 --> 28:40.800
Plus, plus, plus, you have to decide this so quickly.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.720
You know absolutely nothing about them.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.520
No, nothing about them.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.440
It's like- it's like- it's like mystery day.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.760
You look at them for five seconds like, uh, uh, uh.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.240
I have to make a split second decision and you do too.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.600
What's what decides right now?

28:51.600 --> 28:52.480
We're making a connection.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.240
You guys don't believe in love at first sight?

28:54.240 --> 28:54.880
No.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.720
Not when she's driving a shitty rusted out Dodge Dart and holding a pizza box.

28:59.280 --> 29:03.040
Why can't you fall in love with a girl driving a- like you said.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.040
Chaz, you're throwing a lot of hate.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.960
You're throwing a lot of hate this app.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.960
I'm just saying that you know nothing about her.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.480
She knows nothing about you.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.200
It's too on the spot.

29:11.200 --> 29:16.480
I have built entire marriages out of less information

29:16.480 --> 29:19.600
than you like pizza and don't like driving to get pizza.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.480
You're down with Hawaiian.

29:24.480 --> 29:28.080
That must mean you're mysterious, cultured, and you have a sophisticated ballot.

29:29.760 --> 29:34.000
Can I appreciate the intermingling, the delicate dance of salty and sweet?

29:34.560 --> 29:36.880
It looks like you have also gotten brownie bites.

29:36.880 --> 29:42.080
So you are a little fat and I can but I can just see that I can I can scope that one.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.200
Didn't need to Sherlock it out.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.120
I have a Yahoo answer that I'd like for us to discuss.

29:50.160 --> 29:50.400
Okay.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.040
Sent in by Oliver Brogden.

29:53.040 --> 29:53.840
Thank you, Oliver.

29:53.840 --> 29:57.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Richard or Richard who asks.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.440
It's an early early member, huh?

30:01.440 --> 30:05.280
Yeah, he really had he's been sitting on that username for a while now.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.000
Yeah.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.520
What is the most unique bathing experience you have seen or maybe even imagined?

30:13.360 --> 30:19.280
Hi, I am currently designing a bathhouse spa in Spain as part of an architectural thesis.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.040
This will be no ordinary spa.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.200
In fact, it will be highly experimental.

30:23.200 --> 30:29.040
Think Egyptians bathing and donkey milk experimental to get to the point.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.200
We'll get back to that to get to the point.

30:31.200 --> 30:35.520
It is many different bathing swimming spaces experiences.

30:35.520 --> 30:40.400
My question to you is what's the most unique bathing experience you have seen or maybe even

30:40.400 --> 30:40.880
imagined?

30:43.280 --> 30:47.920
Every time I go on Yahoo Answers, I have to get into a scalding hot shower and scrub the top

30:47.920 --> 30:49.040
layer of my skin off.

30:49.040 --> 30:49.920
Does that count?

30:51.200 --> 30:52.880
Griffin, I know there are answers.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.280
Please give them to me.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.240
I mean, there's an S.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.120
There are two essays that people have written that I'm not entirely.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.720
The Roman baths at Bath look pretty inviting.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.040
The green color and warmth look good and tranquil.

31:07.040 --> 31:11.840
In Herigut, there was this very old steam bath complex with lots of rooms and different ways

31:11.840 --> 31:12.720
to hang out.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.160
Hey, let's go to the-

31:14.160 --> 31:15.280
Can I ask you something?

31:15.280 --> 31:17.520
Can I ask you guys something about this?

31:17.520 --> 31:19.360
This side topic sort of.

31:19.360 --> 31:24.400
Do you guys agree that like of all the historical knowledge you can have, historical knowledge

31:24.400 --> 31:27.120
about the ancient Greeks is pretty much the weirdest?

31:27.120 --> 31:28.000
Mm-hmm.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.080
Like, it's like the creepiest one that when you know about it, like, and mentioning it,

31:32.080 --> 31:34.320
like, it's like, it's the creepiest, right?

31:34.320 --> 31:36.160
It says a certain thing about a person.

31:36.160 --> 31:42.640
Like, if you know a lot about the ancient Greeks, then you just like a fucking party.

31:42.640 --> 31:46.640
You are just a nonstop, like, put anything in front of me.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.680
I'll fuck it.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.800
Like, that's what it says.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.200
That's what I hear is that you like that.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.640
You like just, yeah.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.040
I'm going to put a stop to two things right now.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.200
Just preemptory stop.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.480
I don't want any emails about how wonderful bathhouses are.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.200
Okay.

32:01.200 --> 32:05.040
And I don't want any emails about how awesome the ancient Greeks were.

32:05.040 --> 32:05.280
Yeah.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.200
I'm telling you right now, I'm sure you had a great time.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.800
You had a great time in your Greek bathhouses and whatnot.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.320
It's not for me.

32:14.320 --> 32:23.280
Can a bathhouse be something that you can go to, oh gosh, how to phrase this?

32:23.280 --> 32:29.120
Without a bathhouse, without making a bathhouse lifestyle change.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.280
Can it be something that I just go to like-

32:33.280 --> 32:35.120
So like, can you dabble in bathhouse?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.160
My bath is broken.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.920
Is there a place much like a laundromat for clothing?

32:39.920 --> 32:42.000
I'm talking about a laundromat for human skin.

32:42.000 --> 32:42.800
Okay.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.760
Just to chill out.

32:43.760 --> 32:44.400
Just to hang out.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.720
You know what I don't have?

32:46.720 --> 32:49.760
I do not have a boiling hot pool of donkey milk.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.120
I would, yeah.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.400
Yeah, hey, I'd kind of like to know what that's like a little bit.

32:56.080 --> 32:59.600
I would like to swim in a bathtub filled with silica gel.

33:00.480 --> 33:06.160
I would like to hear an undiscovered Barry Manilow and Bette Midler playing together

33:06.160 --> 33:11.760
for the very first time for an adoring crowd of gentlemen at a bathhouse.

33:12.960 --> 33:16.240
And I want to be able to go to that without making a lifestyle change.

33:16.240 --> 33:16.720
You know what I mean?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.560
I just want to be part of that experience.

33:18.560 --> 33:22.640
I would like to be a member of a bathhouse in the same way that I want to be a member

33:22.640 --> 33:26.160
of a gym, where I just show up and just go to the juice bar.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.640
Like, I don't want to actually work out or do any of that stuff.

33:28.640 --> 33:32.480
I just want to hang out and like, get some juice.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.040
I mean, if you go to a bathhouse, you're going to get some juice.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.800
You know there are juice stores.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.040
Yeah.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.040
I may have a fundamental-

33:41.040 --> 33:42.160
Travis, will you do me a favor?

33:42.160 --> 33:45.040
Will you go to a bathhouse, walk in the door and just shout,

33:45.040 --> 33:46.480
where can I get some juice?

33:47.120 --> 33:47.840
Give me the juice.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.880
Anyone got juice?

33:50.400 --> 33:53.840
I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a bathhouse is.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.040
I do not know.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.600
I believe it's like a skeezy YMCA.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.520
It's a sexy YMCA, where there's no workout equipment, just the bath part.

34:01.520 --> 34:04.480
Just a large tub filled with naked people.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.160
I don't think it's one large tub.

34:06.160 --> 34:06.880
See, that's what I thought.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.320
I'm almost certain it's one large tub, and then you have steam rooms off on the side.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.520
I thought it was just like a big, hot pool.

34:13.520 --> 34:18.480
Like a pool that is heated, and also there's like 30 goddamn dicks in that thing.

34:20.800 --> 34:27.440
Will someone please email us and let us know what their personal favorite bathhouse is like?

34:28.480 --> 34:29.440
I don't want to read it.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.320
I don't want to read it.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.440
I want Travis to read it.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.720
But you're not going to have to read it.

34:32.720 --> 34:33.440
I'm going to have to read it.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.640
I'm going to get educated on this.

34:34.640 --> 34:41.680
I just googled bathhouse, and the top result is a Wikipedia entry for gay bathhouse.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.520
And the second result is a Wikipedia entry for bathhouse.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.680
So even Google kind of...

34:48.880 --> 34:49.920
Google's biased.

34:51.440 --> 34:54.480
But really, you two, let's dig deep.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.720
What is the most unique bathing experience you've ever seen, or maybe even imagined?

35:00.640 --> 35:01.520
Like for reals?

35:01.520 --> 35:05.600
Because I've seen on some like travel specials where there's stuff where they

35:05.600 --> 35:11.840
bathe in like lava-heated pools and stuff that I guess looks okay, and there's monkeys in them.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.120
On episode three sheets, I saw Zane Lamprey bathe in beer.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.880
It's supposed to be a hangover cure.

35:16.880 --> 35:17.680
Yeah, that looked nice.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.120
Oh, comfy.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.000
Maybe bullshit, but...

35:22.000 --> 35:26.720
I, this is, I can't in good conscience come up with anything because

35:27.920 --> 35:30.000
we've talked about how dangerous baths are.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.080
Yeah, we, I think we are pretty firmly anti-bath.

35:34.080 --> 35:34.880
I feel like...

35:34.880 --> 35:35.760
I mean, you can do it.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
You just have to be responsible about it.

35:37.520 --> 35:43.040
And there's nothing more irresponsible than a hot donkey milk bath

35:43.040 --> 35:44.640
because what's going on in that water?

35:44.640 --> 35:50.720
To be fair though, the nice thing about bathhouses is it provides you with 29 spotters

35:50.720 --> 35:54.400
to make sure that if you go down, there's someone there to pull you back up.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.320
Unless they, yeah, unless they don't want you to.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.200
Hey, the problem with bathhouses, we couldn't even afford to get into one

36:03.200 --> 36:06.080
because we don't have the money to do it.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.600
Is there any solution for that?

36:07.600 --> 36:10.080
Is there a steep price to get into these bathhouses?

36:10.080 --> 36:10.640
I don't know.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.120
There are prices.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.560
Let me hop on Ticket Hub.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.160
Did you say Dickit Hub?

36:16.160 --> 36:32.960
Ticket Hub, money zone, money zone.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.560
Travis, our first is, our first is with GameOverNation.com.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.280
Can you tell us about it?

36:37.920 --> 36:40.000
Well, GameOverNation is a video game site.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.720
It's just three dudes, Javi, Ryan, and Dylan,

36:42.720 --> 36:44.720
and they give their thoughts on the video game industry.

36:44.720 --> 36:49.520
Uh, they have cartoon doppelgangers that star in their animated game reviews and web comic.

36:50.400 --> 36:54.400
Uh, and they, uh, provide instructional videos on how comics are made, which is pretty cool.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.880
In addition to the comic, they have editorials, weekly podcasts, things that'll keep you entertained.

36:58.880 --> 37:03.040
So if you want to check it out, you can go to GameOverNation.com.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.360
GameOverNation.com.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.400
Uh, I, wow, I didn't mean to sing that.

37:08.400 --> 37:13.440
I hope I didn't, I hope Griffin didn't try to murder me for edging out his groove.

37:13.440 --> 37:23.680
Um, the other big exciting thing we have going on this week is, uh, that is, it's, it's for a lady named Melissa.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.200
Sweet Melissa.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.280
Hey, Melissa.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.240
This is from Chris.

37:29.200 --> 37:35.200
And Chris wants you to know, Melissa, that he wants you to have a happy fourth anniversary.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.440
You play Borderlands together, you play Resident Evil 5 together.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.040
You're in love, one would assume.

37:43.040 --> 37:51.040
He kills bugs, she makes sushi, me hopes there's not a connection between the two.

37:51.040 --> 37:56.240
Um, but you guys are, are in love, and I support that.

37:56.240 --> 38:02.000
And I want you to know that you found each other, you hold tight to one another now that you've found someone who will have you.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.600
Never let them go.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.320
We also have a third conductor.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.360
This, this train has a lot of conductors, which is insane.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.560
Yeah, it's a crowded train.

38:10.560 --> 38:24.800
Um, the conductor is, uh, a listener named Taryn, which is a pretty radical name, who, uh, wishes her boyfriend, Israel Briggs, which is the fucking coolest name, uh, a happy belated birthday.

38:24.800 --> 38:29.600
His birthday is July 19th, and, uh, she wants to say, I'm gonna do my best Taryn impression.

38:29.600 --> 38:34.720
Happy birthday from your loving girlfriend Taryn, and I guess I got my swagger back.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.520
That's so sweet.

38:37.520 --> 38:38.720
That's beloved.

38:38.720 --> 38:44.480
People are, people are showing their love for each other with quotes from our show.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.920
I'm uncomfortable with that, actually.

38:45.920 --> 38:57.040
Now let's mock them in song.

38:57.040 --> 39:04.160
You've got a high score in my heart, and I hope that we never part.

39:04.160 --> 39:10.880
And you can be my player, too, and I will do strange things to you.

39:10.880 --> 39:30.240
I said, Melissa and Chris and Taryn and Israel, you've got to get your gaming news from GameOverNation.com.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.240
Happy birthday.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.240
Wait, fuck.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.240
Was it somebody, it was somebody's birthday, okay.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
Someone's birthday.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.240
Wonderful, Griffin, another, another fine job.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.240
These are getting badder.

39:42.240 --> 39:46.240
Yeah, maybe we need to stop doing these.

39:46.240 --> 39:53.440
Um, uh, hey, I fear I might have a problem with hoarding.

39:53.440 --> 39:57.560
I just realized that within arm's reach, I have eight keyboards and three more within

39:57.560 --> 39:58.800
a couple of steps.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.520
I bought four keyboards in the last week.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
Do I need help?

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
Or am I just weird?

40:03.520 --> 40:04.520
Can I be both?

40:04.520 --> 40:05.520
You're definitely weird.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.520
Yeah.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
Those aren't mutually exclusive, Kara.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
Yeah.

40:08.520 --> 40:09.520
Yeah.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.520
Weird people need help.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.520
Uh.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.520
God damn.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.520
You own 11 keyboards?

40:15.520 --> 40:16.720
Okay.

40:16.720 --> 40:17.720
What kind?

40:17.720 --> 40:18.720
Okay.

40:18.720 --> 40:24.480
So like if you own 11 computer keyboards, you're definitely weird.

40:24.480 --> 40:29.360
If you own 11 musical keyboards and like after you buy each one, you're like, it's not the

40:29.360 --> 40:30.360
right sound.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.720
That's what I hear in my head.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.320
Or you've built a keyboard wall.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
Yeah.

40:34.320 --> 40:39.720
Then you have like this epic, like, you would hear it on John D. Libertas, you know, soundscapes

40:39.720 --> 40:40.720
or whatever it's called.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.720
That'd be awesome.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.720
I'm sorry.

40:42.720 --> 40:43.720
How was that again?

40:43.720 --> 40:44.720
Sorry, Travis?

40:44.720 --> 40:45.720
It's synthesizers.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.880
And you said it would be awesome.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
That's how synthesizers sound?

40:49.880 --> 40:50.880
Yeah.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.880
Be-bong-boo.

40:51.880 --> 40:52.880
Echoes.

40:52.880 --> 40:53.880
That's the name of the show.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.080
Echoes with John D. Libertas.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.040
What the fuck are you talking about anymore?

40:59.040 --> 41:01.120
You don't know about Echoes?

41:01.120 --> 41:03.840
You have to stop liking bad things.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.040
I don't like it.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.040
I can't stress enough.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.040
I don't like it.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.040
All right.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.040
It's what comes on NPR at like nine o'clock.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.040
Okay.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.040
Listen.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.040
I'm sorry, John.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.040
He's a listener, of course.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.040
I'm sorry, John D. Libertas.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
Libertas.

41:15.040 --> 41:19.380
John D. Libertas.

41:19.380 --> 41:23.600
Is it possible that she has 22 hands?

41:23.600 --> 41:27.760
Oh, like you think she can't input the data?

41:27.760 --> 41:31.720
Like a man in black, like the alien for men in black, the one that hangs out in the central

41:31.720 --> 41:37.720
hub of the MIB headquarters, MIB HQ, and keeps track of all the aliens.

41:37.720 --> 41:42.440
I think it was, you had a name like Bob or something, like something simple, a simple

41:42.440 --> 41:44.440
name that you wouldn't expect the alien to have.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.160
Fuck what a good movie.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.160
I wish I had a keyboard to smash.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.160
That would be fun.

41:49.160 --> 41:50.160
But here, okay.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.360
You break one of those keyboards over your knee or something.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.360
That would be very stressful.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.960
I think that everybody has at some point while they were like doing spring cleaning or something

41:56.960 --> 41:58.680
realized that they owned-

41:58.680 --> 41:59.680
11 keyboards?

41:59.680 --> 42:04.320
No, that they owned like, why do I have three copies of the same book?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.880
Or why do I have, you know, all these movies?

42:06.880 --> 42:11.360
And why do I have four, you know, half empty spindles of burnable DVDs?

42:11.360 --> 42:12.980
That's normal.

42:12.980 --> 42:18.080
What's not normal is going out and in one week buying four keyboards in one week.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.080
That's no longer about 40.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.520
You know you've got a keyboard.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.520
Yeah.

42:21.520 --> 42:27.800
Like if I have, for example, if I realized yesterday while I was cleaning out my cupboards,

42:27.800 --> 42:30.320
I have two boxes of kosher salt.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.080
If I have two boxes of kosher salt, that's a coincidence.

42:33.080 --> 42:37.480
If I buy four boxes of kosher salt in one week, I have an iodine deficiency and I need

42:37.480 --> 42:39.480
to go to the doctor.

42:39.480 --> 42:41.180
That's the difference.

42:41.180 --> 42:46.480
So yes, if you find yourself uncontrollably buying computer keyboards, you probably have

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
an issue.

42:47.480 --> 42:51.400
Do you think she only meant to buy, like she went to Best Buy and she was like, she just

42:51.400 --> 42:57.440
wanted the one keyboard, but she slipped, she slipped up somehow and she accidentally

42:57.440 --> 42:58.440
bought four?

42:58.440 --> 43:01.640
Do you mean like she was tempted by the features offered by the other three keyboards?

43:01.640 --> 43:05.320
I'm saying she went to the counter at Best Buy and was like, let me get four keyboards.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.320
And they're like, okay.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.520
And they round her up and by the time she was halfway home, she was like, ah, fuck,

43:10.520 --> 43:13.320
I meant one keyboard.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.760
Maybe she said she, Floridian slipped it, was too embarrassed to correct.

43:16.760 --> 43:17.920
And they're like, are you sure?

43:17.920 --> 43:20.640
Excuse me, did you ask for four keyboards?

43:20.640 --> 43:21.640
Yes.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.640
Yeah, I did.

43:22.640 --> 43:25.720
Why don't you mind your own fucking business?

43:25.720 --> 43:29.800
I guess I would want to know, like, why, like, what do you think you need so many for?

43:29.800 --> 43:33.280
Is it so, is it because you keep finding better ones?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.260
Because I own a lot of like Mises.

43:35.260 --> 43:38.040
I own a lot of headphones.

43:38.040 --> 43:43.140
I mean, maybe she's really heavy handed and she keeps like breaking the keys.

43:43.140 --> 43:49.000
And also for her to keep finding better ones and buy four in the same week, that is predicated

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
on her, like, seeing a keyboard at Best Buy, grabbing it, running it up to the cashier

43:54.000 --> 43:59.840
supermarket sweep style, and then going back onto the floor, like, okay, ah, fuck, there's

43:59.840 --> 44:00.840
another one.

44:00.840 --> 44:01.840
Oh, no returns.

44:01.840 --> 44:02.840
Huh?

44:02.840 --> 44:03.840
Okay.

44:03.840 --> 44:04.840
Fuck.

44:04.840 --> 44:08.760
Also, I'm, I'm not all that up on technology and computers and whatnot, but what kind of

44:08.760 --> 44:13.800
keyboard advancements have there been in the last, I don't know, say week that would

44:13.800 --> 44:14.800
necessitate her?

44:14.800 --> 44:16.800
I see, there's more than you'd think.

44:16.800 --> 44:17.800
Yeah.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.800
Really?

44:18.800 --> 44:19.800
What does the keyboard offer?

44:19.800 --> 44:20.800
My keyboard.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.800
This one now with more letters.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.640
My keyboard's wireless.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.800
My keyboard is very light.

44:25.800 --> 44:30.280
My keyboard turns on when you wave your hand over it and glows from within.

44:30.280 --> 44:31.280
Did you get that?

44:31.280 --> 44:34.080
Did you get that keyboard with the new letter on it?

44:34.080 --> 44:37.120
This has Z2.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.120
Huh?

44:38.120 --> 44:39.120
Z1 and Z2.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.120
Yeah, Z2.

44:40.120 --> 44:44.240
It's the sequel to Z. What?

44:44.240 --> 44:47.880
This has Z and Zed, which is pretty cool.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.160
I can't give advice here because I'm too perplexed.

44:51.160 --> 44:57.620
If I had 11 keyboards, I would just, I would just run.

44:57.620 --> 45:00.440
I would just run away from my house as fast as I possibly could.

45:00.440 --> 45:03.360
Can I say something here?

45:03.360 --> 45:10.600
I don't mean to be a downer, but if we can't find a logical reason why Kara has 11 keyboards,

45:10.600 --> 45:16.320
maybe it's, and then she asks us if she needs help or if she's just weird, maybe it's that

45:16.320 --> 45:18.340
first one.

45:18.340 --> 45:22.640
Maybe you do need to talk to somebody about keyboards.

45:22.640 --> 45:28.160
It's like, I was watching David Hasselhoff on Same Name, of course, last week, and he

45:28.160 --> 45:34.200
was working in the electrical industry because David Hasselhoff that he was replacing was

45:34.200 --> 45:36.560
working in the electrical industry.

45:36.560 --> 45:42.120
And they went to fix a giant breaker, a giant electrical breaker, and he was cleaning it

45:42.120 --> 45:43.240
out.

45:43.240 --> 45:48.440
And David Hasselhoff said, I don't even know where the electrical breaker is in my own

45:48.440 --> 45:49.620
home.

45:49.620 --> 45:52.680
If the lights go out at my house, I move.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.000
Hey, Dave.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.520
That's the kind of keyboard relationship.

45:56.520 --> 46:00.380
Dave, I- Oh, so she doesn't know how to clean it, so she just buys a new one.

46:00.380 --> 46:06.640
I think that, Dave, I really appreciate everything you've done for our show, but you can't have

46:06.640 --> 46:09.680
that much money left, dawg.

46:09.680 --> 46:14.280
You can't have more than, I'm gonna say, a hundo thou in the bank right now, at this

46:14.280 --> 46:15.480
very moment.

46:15.480 --> 46:21.000
Nah, he's got a guaranteed revenue stream, because every time things get tight, he sells

46:21.000 --> 46:23.720
a shitty black car to somebody and says it's the real kit.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.720
Oh, man.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.640
This is the real one they use in the show.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.640
Believe this.

46:27.640 --> 46:29.560
I can't believe I'm parting with this.

46:29.560 --> 46:30.560
This is a minivan.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.840
Yeah, no, that was it.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.480
They just filmed it from weird angles.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.480
Bye, Feeny.

46:34.480 --> 46:35.480
This is the real kit.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.480
Treat him nice.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.480
Treat him good.

46:37.480 --> 46:39.920
Thanks for the hundo grand.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.840
It's not a problem for him.

46:42.840 --> 46:48.560
My younger brother has a tendency of doing overly romantic things for his girlfriend.

46:48.560 --> 46:52.880
For example- I almost thought that was gonna say me, and I thought this was gonna be the

46:52.880 --> 46:53.880
best question ever.

46:53.880 --> 46:54.920
I got so excited.

46:54.920 --> 47:00.280
For example, he took her to see the sunrise on the east coast of Florida, went skydiving,

47:00.280 --> 47:04.480
had a fancy dinner, and then watched the sunset on the west coast of Florida.

47:04.480 --> 47:08.840
How can I avoid looking like a jerk to my girlfriend when my younger brother is clearly

47:08.840 --> 47:12.720
setting the bar too high with his girlfriend, says Dan.

47:12.720 --> 47:17.280
That's the sweetest thing I have ever read.

47:17.280 --> 47:21.760
Hey, Bad News Dan, you better worry about looking like a bad boyfriend to us.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.760
Like start with us and then work to your girlfriend.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.760
He-

47:24.760 --> 47:25.760
Because I'm impressed with your brother.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.760
I'm impressed with Dan's brother.

47:28.760 --> 47:29.760
Dan Jr.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
Dan Jr.

47:30.760 --> 47:35.320
Dan Jr.

47:35.320 --> 47:40.760
But keep in mind, that date sounds great, but it may have been like super stressful.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.720
Because he watched the sunrise on the east coast of Florida, he's like, get the fucking

47:43.720 --> 47:44.720
car!

47:44.720 --> 47:45.720
We gotta go!

47:45.720 --> 47:46.720
Get in the car!

47:46.720 --> 47:47.720
We're racing the sun!

47:47.720 --> 47:50.720
Dan, I don't know what to tell you.

47:50.720 --> 47:55.260
I think you gotta give up love forever, or go away, or move away so that nobody ever

47:55.260 --> 47:59.840
hears about your younger brother's exploits, because he is some sort of like genetically

47:59.840 --> 48:03.360
engineered Lothario that can't be beat.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.520
That's the sweetest thing I've ever read.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.680
A sunrise and a sunset?

48:07.680 --> 48:10.040
And they went skydiving?

48:10.040 --> 48:14.720
Maybe you could hope that eventually, and inevitably, he'll run out of things to do

48:14.720 --> 48:16.200
and then he'll just start repeating himself.

48:16.200 --> 48:17.200
Oh, right.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.700
I don't think he'll ever run out of things to do.

48:18.700 --> 48:23.440
I think date two is somehow they're gonna go to space.

48:23.440 --> 48:24.820
I was gonna say that!

48:24.820 --> 48:26.960
We watched the sunrise from the moon!

48:26.960 --> 48:34.680
Dan, I think your best ploy is to secretly, covertly tear down your brother when he's

48:34.680 --> 48:36.120
not in the room.

48:36.120 --> 48:43.240
So let him tell his story, and then as soon as he leaves the room, you lean over to your

48:43.240 --> 48:47.920
girlfriend and say, secretly, he does not have a penis.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.920
Yeah.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.120
Or, secretly, he's very abusive.

48:51.120 --> 48:57.280
Like something where it's gonna tear Dan Jr. down and build you up.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
And not true.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
It can't be true.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.280
Like, what do you want, baby?

49:00.280 --> 49:01.280
You want the sunset every night?

49:01.280 --> 49:05.440
Or do you want a man who has a penis?

49:05.440 --> 49:06.440
Your call.

49:06.440 --> 49:12.200
Do you want a man with a penis, or do you want to see, like taste oranges from every

49:12.200 --> 49:13.200
part of the state?

49:13.200 --> 49:14.200
Because he bought you a big box of them.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.200
Eat all these oranges!

49:15.200 --> 49:16.200
I love you!

49:16.200 --> 49:17.200
Sorry about my no penis.

49:17.200 --> 49:25.000
I'm like, I'm like a Ken doll down there, but I'm taking you to space.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.360
This is the weirdest card on a floral bouquet I've ever received.

49:29.360 --> 49:34.480
Uh, yeah, Dan Jr., what would you like the card to say?

49:34.480 --> 49:37.000
Um, sorry I'm all smooth down there.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Eat these oranges.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
I love you.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.680
Hey, check it out, sunset!

49:40.680 --> 49:41.680
Look up!

49:41.680 --> 49:42.680
Look up!

49:42.680 --> 49:43.680
Don't look down!

49:43.680 --> 49:44.680
Don't look down!

49:44.680 --> 49:48.280
Ain't nothing for you there.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.960
It's my own orange grove.

49:49.960 --> 49:50.960
I love you.

49:50.960 --> 49:53.840
I styled my pubes to look like a penis.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.840
I love you.

49:54.840 --> 49:57.040
It's very romantic.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.000
How did we not think of that?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.800
How did we not think of that when we were talking about the pube question to make your

50:01.800 --> 50:05.280
pubes look like another penis?

50:05.280 --> 50:09.240
Another bigger penis on top of your penis armor, as it were.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.240
A penis jerkin.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
Yeah.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.240
A gherkin jerkin.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
A gherkin jerkin.

50:13.240 --> 50:15.280
A gherkin jerkin for jerkin.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
A jerkin jerkin.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.280
Um, a merkin jerkin.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.280
Stop.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.280
A merkin jerkin lurkin.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.280
Turducken.

50:20.280 --> 50:26.800
I styled my pubes to do a turducken.

50:26.800 --> 50:32.000
Dan, I think, I think you just gotta chill on this for a bit because Dan Jr.'s gonna

50:32.000 --> 50:35.560
get his heart broke sooner rather than later.

50:35.560 --> 50:41.360
I mean, everyone's romantic style is different and, you know, maybe yours is more sustainable.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.700
It is universal.

50:42.700 --> 50:47.040
When Dan Jr. gets his heart broke, the shine is gonna come right off that love apple.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
It's gonna come right up off it.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.040
Oh, sure.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.040
Yeah.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.340
Today, I'm taking you to this table at Denny's and then we're going to move to another table

50:54.340 --> 50:57.000
at Denny's, provided this is not an inconvenience.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Why are you crying?

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
I miss the sunsets.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
I miss my penis.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Bad things happen.

51:01.000 --> 51:09.880
That's where you get a sausage factory for you.

51:09.880 --> 51:12.160
Grow up.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.160
Going to love again.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.160
I can't.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.160
I'm Dan Jr.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.160
Dan Jr. is...

51:16.160 --> 51:17.160
Griffin's right.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.640
Dan Jr., this is a...

51:19.640 --> 51:24.280
He is in a sprint and Dan is in a marathon.

51:24.280 --> 51:27.160
So you're saying Dan Jr.'s playing a young man's game.

51:27.160 --> 51:29.360
Dan Jr.'s playing a young man's game.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.360
That's exactly it.

51:30.360 --> 51:34.160
They're gonna bench him in the 15th outing.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.160
Wow.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.160
Yep.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.160
You know what I mean?

51:38.160 --> 51:39.160
Nope.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.160
You know.

51:40.160 --> 51:48.200
He's gonna get a couple of hit-ems and he's just gonna ice it in the showers, you know?

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
I don't know.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.200
Are these croquet terms?

51:50.200 --> 51:51.680
Why have I never heard these before?

51:51.680 --> 51:53.960
He's gonna get a few hoops.

51:53.960 --> 51:54.960
Yep.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.960
Mm-hmm.

51:55.960 --> 51:56.960
A few long...

51:56.960 --> 51:57.960
Some long booms.

51:57.960 --> 51:58.960
Some RBAs.

51:58.960 --> 51:59.960
Some RBAs.

51:59.960 --> 52:00.960
Tell you...

52:00.960 --> 52:01.960
And Dan, here's the other thing.

52:01.960 --> 52:02.960
He's your younger brother.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.400
Go to him and tell him to fucking cheese it.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.400
Yeah.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.240
Say, Dan Jr., can you cheese it with that?

52:09.240 --> 52:11.840
Can you please keep it to yourself if you're gonna keep doing it?

52:11.840 --> 52:12.840
Which you should not.

52:12.840 --> 52:17.360
Hey, Dan, I spoke to every other guy in the world ever and you're making us all look bad.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.360
Not me.

52:18.360 --> 52:19.360
Yeah.

52:19.360 --> 52:20.360
You guys don't know my style.

52:20.360 --> 52:21.360
You know what I do?

52:21.360 --> 52:23.800
I give a lady two sunsets in a day.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.920
Like you cross that international date line?

52:25.920 --> 52:32.120
I fly backwards across the world and I catch Sunset, the sequel.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.120
You catch the 11 o'clock.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.120
Uh-huh.

52:34.120 --> 52:41.320
I get on my private jet in my G6 and then we fly and we just keep catching and we just

52:41.320 --> 52:43.200
chase that sun.

52:43.200 --> 52:46.440
Do we have time for one more question or do we need to wrap up?

52:46.440 --> 52:47.920
We have time for one more Yahoo question.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
Okay.

52:48.920 --> 52:49.920
This one was sent in by...

52:49.920 --> 52:50.920
Make it a good one.

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
This one was sent in by Michael Maney.

52:51.920 --> 52:52.920
Thank you, Michael.

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
Hey.

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
Hey.

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
You know that guy.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
It's my...

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
Who is also the artist of the amazing Giant Scott Baklova versus Donnerfield.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
Oh, my God.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.240
You should be following us if you have not seen it.

53:01.240 --> 53:02.240
Follow us on Twitter, please.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
Follow him on Twitter, too.

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
Follow Michael Maney.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.240
Michael Maney.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.240
M-A-Y-N-E.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
Yahoo!

53:07.240 --> 53:16.280
Answer's user Bunny asks, do ghosts see you when you are having sex or when you are using

53:16.280 --> 53:18.520
the toilet?

53:18.520 --> 53:23.000
I think my house is haunted and I don't mind, but I was thinking that if it was my dead

53:23.000 --> 53:26.920
granddad or anyone else I know who has died, then it would be embarrassing if they saw

53:26.920 --> 53:31.360
me naked or doing things with my husband or on the toilet.

53:31.360 --> 53:38.920
Hey, dummy, here's the thing.

53:38.920 --> 53:44.600
Let's play into the premise that your house is haunted with your granddad.

53:44.600 --> 53:49.600
Do you think that in the ethereal plane, he's really super-duper worried about what you're

53:49.600 --> 53:50.600
doing on the toilet?

53:50.600 --> 53:53.520
Yeah, that would be really weird of your grandpa.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.160
Was your grandpa like a nasty freak?

53:55.160 --> 53:58.800
Is that like something you do, like poke his head in ghost head style, like what's going

53:58.800 --> 53:59.800
on in here?

53:59.800 --> 54:00.800
Oh, sorry.

54:00.800 --> 54:01.800
I didn't realize.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.120
Oh, I won't keep you.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.120
I tried to-

54:04.120 --> 54:07.280
If he was a nasty Gramps in real life, then I have no reason to believe he won't be a

54:07.280 --> 54:09.560
nasty Gramps in the afterlife.

54:09.560 --> 54:13.640
You know, ghosts, the idea of a ghost is that after they die, they had unfinished business.

54:13.640 --> 54:17.960
If his unfinished business is to peep on you while you're doing it or hitting the toilet,

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
then-

54:18.960 --> 54:21.640
If his unfinished business is your unfinished business, then-

54:21.640 --> 54:24.720
I can't move on until I watch your deuce.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.880
I can't move on until you make a movement.

54:26.880 --> 54:30.840
I would watch people fuck all the time if I was a ghost, so-

54:30.840 --> 54:32.400
Eat your ghost popcorn.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.400
What is this question?

54:33.400 --> 54:34.900
Is this-

54:34.900 --> 54:36.800
Of course they fucking do.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.520
Like, are ghosts not allowed to watch you fuck?

54:39.520 --> 54:43.480
Like, if you have sex in a room with a ghost in, the ghost is like, oh, I gotta go!

54:43.480 --> 54:44.480
Gotta dip!

54:44.480 --> 54:45.480
This is awkward.

54:45.480 --> 54:46.480
Are they just colorblind?

54:46.480 --> 54:49.360
Like, they can't see naked people?

54:49.360 --> 54:50.360
Don't be a child.

54:50.360 --> 54:51.360
This is-

54:51.360 --> 54:52.400
Don't be a child.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.800
Of course ghosts are watching you have sex all the time.

54:54.800 --> 54:58.640
You're not allowed to believe in ghosts and hauntings and also believe that ghosts aren't

54:58.640 --> 55:03.000
gonna watch you fuck and use the bathroom, because of course they do.

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
The reason the rest of us are out here in fucking Sane Town is because I- that idea

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
is too creepy.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.200
I can't- I can't even begin to believe that- that there are not only ghosts, but they're

55:15.200 --> 55:16.200
watching me deuce.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.880
Do you know why it's creepy?

55:18.880 --> 55:22.920
Almost a trillion people have walked the Earth.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.680
Just one- really, let that number sink in.

55:25.680 --> 55:30.400
A trill of people have walked the Earth.

55:30.400 --> 55:34.120
The space is gotta be- we are just caught in like a fog of ghosts.

55:34.120 --> 55:39.440
So, what you're saying is, the chances that when I am shooting a duke, there is a ghost

55:39.440 --> 55:41.440
not only watching me, but occupying the same space that I am.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
In you!

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
Under you!

55:43.440 --> 55:45.200
You are shitting at a ghost!

55:45.200 --> 55:48.760
You are not only having sex with your wife, you're having sex with like three to four

55:48.760 --> 55:52.560
ghosts that are inhabiting the same space as your wife's.

55:52.560 --> 55:56.200
We need to deal with this astral infestation.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.320
This is ridiculous, Griffin.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.360
Many of them have gone to hell.

56:00.360 --> 56:03.280
For watching people use the bathroom.

56:03.280 --> 56:09.560
That's the secret about ghosts, like that's the one rule of ghosts, is that you get to

56:09.560 --> 56:13.280
walk the Earth, but if you watch people have sex, or make a BM, or if you actually see

56:13.280 --> 56:15.840
a penis or a boob, you go to hell.

56:15.840 --> 56:16.840
Instantly.

56:16.840 --> 56:17.840
There is no appeal.

56:17.840 --> 56:23.320
I'm suggesting that we can really get rid of these trillion ghosts if we all just walk

56:23.320 --> 56:24.320
around with our dicks out.

56:24.320 --> 56:25.320
Yeah, bye ghosts.

56:25.320 --> 56:26.320
What are you doing?

56:26.320 --> 56:31.720
They'll say as I walk down the street with my dick out, and I'll just say, ghost busted.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.000
Busted makes me feel good.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.360
Busted makes me feel good, which explains how fully erect I am.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.680
Don't mind me.

56:37.680 --> 56:38.680
What are you doing?

56:38.680 --> 56:39.680
I'm killing ghosts.

56:39.680 --> 56:40.680
Well.

56:40.680 --> 56:43.280
It makes me feel good.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.800
It's finally happened.

56:45.800 --> 56:46.800
Finally happened.

56:46.800 --> 56:48.520
I'm chasing ghosts around with his penis.

56:48.520 --> 56:53.000
Did you guys hear Ray Parker Jr. got locked up for public exposure?

56:53.000 --> 56:54.480
We got to get him out.

56:54.480 --> 57:01.480
He's the only one who can stop- There's a joke about me calling my penis Slimer in here.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.480
Give me a second.

57:02.480 --> 57:03.480
Okay.

57:03.480 --> 57:04.480
We'll just take a break.

57:04.480 --> 57:05.480
Okay.

57:05.480 --> 57:06.480
All right.

57:06.480 --> 57:07.480
I'll tell you what.

57:07.480 --> 57:08.480
We'll do some housekeeping, and then we'll come back.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.480
Okay.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.360
And you can tell us the joke about your penis being named Slimer.

57:11.360 --> 57:12.560
You can follow us on Twitter.

57:12.560 --> 57:16.720
We're NBNBAM, at NBNBAM, I guess.

57:16.720 --> 57:18.200
We have forums at MaximumFun.org.

57:18.200 --> 57:23.920
You can email us, NBNBAM, at MaximumFun.org.

57:23.920 --> 57:27.240
And we got a FormSpring question in here, so I'm going to start checking those again.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.760
So if you want to hit us up on FormSpring, you can.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.960
I suggest Gmail, though.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.160
It's much more direct.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.160
Yeah.

57:33.160 --> 57:36.160
It's easier to catalog to.

57:36.160 --> 57:38.520
There are other MaximumFun podcasts that you would enjoy.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.480
Check out Jordan and Jesse go to the Sound of Young America.

57:40.480 --> 57:42.760
Stop podcasting yourself.

57:42.760 --> 57:44.920
Our friends, our close personal friends.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.480
Also, we have t-shirts for sale.

57:47.480 --> 57:51.520
All the t-shirts are back in.

57:51.520 --> 57:54.600
They're all at MaxFunStore.com.

57:54.600 --> 58:01.080
Some were sold out, but they are all back, all sizes, and any ones you could want.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.440
Some are running low.

58:03.440 --> 58:06.760
I see that the 2X has gone on back order.

58:06.760 --> 58:09.440
Those will be back in momentarily, I'm sure.

58:09.440 --> 58:12.400
But most all the sizes are there, so go get them.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.400
Go buy them.

58:13.400 --> 58:18.360

58:30.080 --> 58:34.800
Not just listening, but also spreading the word to people.

58:34.800 --> 58:45.040
A lot of people like SmartBuddy, Joshba, Patrick Neville, Brendan from Beer, spreading the

58:45.040 --> 58:46.040
word.

58:46.040 --> 58:49.800
A lot of people trying to get the Onion AV Club to review us.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.720
I really appreciate that.

58:52.720 --> 58:53.720
Thanks to Indie Mike.

58:53.720 --> 58:57.560
And you know, special thanks not only to all of our wonderful Twitter friends, but all

58:57.560 --> 59:02.760
of our real life friends that are going out there and talking to people in the real world.

59:02.760 --> 59:06.200
Maybe you're telling your friends about it at work or something like that and you don't

59:06.200 --> 59:07.880
get a chance to mention it on Twitter.

59:07.880 --> 59:11.880
So thank you if you're doing, you know, fighting the good fight.

59:11.880 --> 59:16.200
And I want to thank our best friend of all, John Roderick and the Long Winners, for letting

59:16.200 --> 59:17.200
us use the song.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.840
It's a departure as our theme song.

59:18.840 --> 59:23.240
You can get that song and a bunch of other really good songs on the album Putting the

59:23.240 --> 59:25.160
Days to Bed, which is on iTunes.

59:25.160 --> 59:27.160
So go buy it, silly.

59:27.160 --> 59:29.200
So buy it, dumb-dumb.

59:29.200 --> 59:35.040
All right, this final Yahoo is sent in by Gray Dotridge, it's by Yahoo Institute's user

59:35.040 --> 59:43.840
Chris Monsanto, who asks, is Family Matters an accurate portrayal of African-American

59:43.840 --> 59:44.840
families?

59:44.840 --> 59:45.840
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:45.840 --> 59:46.840
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:46.840 --> 59:47.840
I'm Coco McElroy.

59:47.840 --> 59:48.840
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:48.840 --> 59:49.840
Kiss your dad.

59:49.840 --> 01:00:10.440
Square on the lips.
