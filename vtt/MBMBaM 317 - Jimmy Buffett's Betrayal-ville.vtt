00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.760
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and brother mean advice show for the modern era.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.120
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.600
And me, I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:53.600 --> 01:00.400
Gather ye round, children. I have ye a story to tell.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.080
Are you going to talk about the true crime that happened to you?

01:04.080 --> 01:08.960
I'm going to tell you about the true crime that happened to me this past fortnight.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.880
It was like a couple days ago.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.680
Okay, we got to stop right now. Is this a horror story,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.880
or is it a true crime story? Because you're kind of doing both things.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.680
I tell you, Griffin, it is a true crime story about the horror of humanity.

01:21.680 --> 01:25.280
The dark passenger that lives in all men's souls.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.800
Okay, so I submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.040
Travis lost some furniture.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.440
The story of the missing patio furniture.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.240
Her tale of this tale through campfires, but it's telling has been changed.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.440
I swear it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.400
I thought that this was internet creepypasta, like a Slenderman.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.960
No, it's true. The patio furniture was stolen.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.760
Theresa and I, when we lived in our last apartment, had to set a patio furniture.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.880
We moved to the new apartment. There was no room for it.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.440
So we chained it together with our bikes in our covered parking space.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.400
You made a little theft honeypot of the two most desired to be stolen things,

02:10.400 --> 02:12.320
patio furniture and bicycles.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.320
But we covered it in a tarp, Griffin, which seemed to remove it from inside.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.560
That's gift wrap for stealers.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.240
We shadowed it from the world, and the world could not find it behind the tarp

02:22.240 --> 02:24.880
in which we hid it to keep it safe from prying eyes.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.680
And so now in our move, we've decided not to take any of that shit with us.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.840
So we sold the bikes in like 10 minutes,

02:33.840 --> 02:36.240
but we couldn't seem to get rid of the patio furniture.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.360
Now this patio furniture was all chained together in an awkward way,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.200
stacked atop one another.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.640
We were gone for about an hour.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.440
We came back, it was gone.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.640
We were very frustrated, but at the same time,

02:52.640 --> 02:55.440
we had been trying to get rid of it.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.480
Though for money, not for free.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.280
Not for no money.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.360
So I was perturbed.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.800
Sounds like you lost a really good chain and tarp as well.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.920
I just bought a heavy duty lock for like $25

03:09.920 --> 03:12.160
that I was going to use on our storage unit.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.520
And I was using on the chain, and that was stolen.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.040
And that was a bummy out more than anything.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.720
That lock was not two hours old.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.600
So I took the dog on a walk hoping that maybe I could like,

03:21.600 --> 03:25.920
I guess, scope the furniture sitting in someone's front yard.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.040
The perfect crime.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.280
And I did not find it.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.320
And I got back to our apartment and there was a dude

03:32.320 --> 03:34.960
like chilling out on our steps of our apartment.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.320
And he lives in the building.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.600
And I was like, hey, you didn't by some chance

03:39.600 --> 03:44.160
like see a truck pull up and like take some patio furniture.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.440
And he was like, what color?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.960
As though there were a bunch of patio furniture.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.440
I saw some red furniture get took.

03:52.160 --> 03:52.960
Was that you?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.880
I saw some yellow last week.

03:54.880 --> 03:55.520
Was that you?

03:56.560 --> 03:59.680
And so I was like, well, the patio furniture was black.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.720
And he was like, oh, it's in the back of the building.

04:04.480 --> 04:04.800
What?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.880
And I was like, in the back of this building?

04:06.880 --> 04:07.680
He was like, yeah.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.480
So like I walked back there still chained together.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.280
It was behind the building.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.800
So someone had moved it from our parking spot.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.360
I guess ostensibly to plan on breaking apart

04:19.360 --> 04:22.240
the chain later and using it.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.840
Or maybe the fact that you left a fucking eyesore out.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.320
It was a covered.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.240
You could not see it from the street.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.320
A cover didn't make it invisible, Trav.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.240
You couldn't see it from the street.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.320
The only way you would have known the furniture was there

04:36.320 --> 04:38.320
was by walking into our parking spot.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.080
What are you talking?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.840
Okay, but like, it's an eyesore.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.440
I mean, they probably thought they wanted to park there.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.120
I guess if you're worried about the beautification

04:45.120 --> 04:47.680
of our parking spot, then yes, it's an eyesore.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.280
I'm saying that's never part of anybody's landscaping.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.600
I don't care if it was a tarp or covered or what.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.440
The Property Brothers are never like,

04:55.440 --> 04:58.240
and now we got a really nice tarp out here for you

04:58.240 --> 04:59.760
covering some things we can't sell.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.560
They don't show that on the show,

05:02.560 --> 05:04.960
but I guarantee there's always a tarp

05:06.080 --> 05:07.920
just like tucked into every corner

05:07.920 --> 05:09.840
of every Property Brothers house.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.520
You're not allowed to look under it.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.840
Whoever did this just changed from a horror true crime story

05:15.840 --> 05:16.880
to a hero story.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.200
Cause whoever did this had to work very hard

05:19.200 --> 05:22.320
to move this big chain together, bulky furniture thing.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.520
I'm talking about a John Henry size two cows stacked up.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.240
Like that's how big I'm talking of a man or a woman

05:28.240 --> 05:30.160
or person just like grabbed all this furniture

05:30.160 --> 05:30.880
and threw it behind.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.320
It must've been really hard for them to do it.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.960
And they only did it because you made such an ugly thing.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.960
You made it a really ugly thing in the world.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.960
It was a beautiful sculpture of furniture and chain

05:40.960 --> 05:42.480
that they ruined.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.760
And now that furniture is sitting in my living room

05:45.760 --> 05:49.440
because now I might power huge and I don't trust the world

05:49.440 --> 05:51.680
and I can't put it back out there or it'll just be gone.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.680
Maybe this time I never find it again.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.880
You wanna get rid of it.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.680
Yeah, but I wanna get rid of it for money.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.520
I'm an American, Justin.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.320
I want money for my goods and services.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.280
How much do you-

06:03.280 --> 06:04.560
I would really like to know like,

06:04.560 --> 06:07.440
unless you need patio furniture in your home,

06:07.440 --> 06:10.480
what is step two after stealing a bunch of patio?

06:10.480 --> 06:14.160
Like, where do you go to buy stolen patio furniture?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.640
And where do you put it that it's not gonna get scoped?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.160
Fucking Pier 1 Imports.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.080
A lot of people don't know this about Pier 1 Imports.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.160
Is that what those quotation marks are on imports means?

06:24.160 --> 06:26.720
I always wondered.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.760
Yeah, if you actually rearrange the letters in Pier 1 Imports,

06:29.760 --> 06:33.120
it's STOL, pya pya pya.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.240
Which is Missy Elliott for patio furniture.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.240
Yeah, just stuff to keep in mind.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.840
Everything in Pier 1 Imports is stolen.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.440
You take it down to Pier,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.600
you take it down to Jimmy at Pier 1.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.280
He'll fence it for you right quick.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.360
Whenever someone says it fell off the back of a truck,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.280
it's always a Pier 1 Imports truck.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.880
Yeah, that's true.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.640
They have the worst trucks in the business.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.880
I just wanna say, I wanna make a point

06:58.880 --> 07:03.040
that this is Travis's final bim bam

07:03.040 --> 07:06.640
that's gonna have that like Hollywood sheen.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.200
You know what I mean?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.440
This is the last flashy one.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.120
I've gotten really used to all of our stuff

07:13.120 --> 07:14.640
having like that Hollywood sheen.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.920
And we're about to lose that for good.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.000
And I'm glad we're getting in like some of this

07:20.000 --> 07:22.240
true Hollywood stuff under the wire.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.600
Like the time that someone moved furniture

07:25.600 --> 07:26.880
that Travis left outside.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.000
That's the kind of stuff that only happens in LA.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.960
Travis, can I ask you a question?

07:30.960 --> 07:34.080
Do you think it was Tom Hanks who did the furniture move?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.400
Griffin, can I tell you?

07:36.400 --> 07:37.680
It reeked of Tom Cruise.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.280
Tom Cruise?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.280
There's one thing I know about Cruise.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.040
Loves patio furniture.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.840
I am just so grateful to Travis

07:45.840 --> 07:47.840
for reserving this story for us

07:47.840 --> 07:50.560
and not selling it to this American Life or Risk

07:50.560 --> 07:53.360
or another audio store, The Moth perhaps,

07:53.360 --> 07:55.120
like audio storytelling format.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.040
Actually, I'm gonna do it on Song Exploder.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.720
What a departure for them.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.480
Yeah, you can really pick up the travel.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.840
It was just too juicy.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.320
It was just too, they couldn't pass up the opportunity

08:08.320 --> 08:09.680
to break this story.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.680
Hey, give me a question, please.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.120
I got one for you.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.040
I'm feeling ready for it.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.120
I recently came home to find my garbage can

08:17.120 --> 08:19.200
and recycling bin sitting in the street.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.880
Whoa, how about this synergy?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.240
Normally, I would have just attributed it to the wind,

08:24.240 --> 08:28.320
but my neighbors were placed perfectly up right back.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.520
There's a possessive there.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.920
This is not describing the position of their neighbors.

08:31.920 --> 08:32.960
Their neighbors is-

08:34.000 --> 08:35.920
Well, my neighbors are standing perfectly

08:35.920 --> 08:36.960
in the middle of the street.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.760
Our neighbors who are sealed in a giant Tupperware

08:39.760 --> 08:41.680
like that one episode of Eerie Indiana

08:41.680 --> 08:42.960
were placed perfectly upright

08:42.960 --> 08:45.680
back where I remember seeing them in the morning.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.240
I thought my relationship with the folks picking up my trash

08:48.240 --> 08:50.640
was all right, but this has me rethinking that.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.880
Have I angered my garbage man?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.040
Can we get back to where we used to be?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.800
And that's Jess from North Bay, Ontario.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.160
Wait, what, hold on.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.440
I don't know, wait.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.560
I don't know that I've ever given two thoughts

09:02.560 --> 09:06.320
to what my current relationship with the garbage

09:06.320 --> 09:10.720
people collecting my garbage is.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.200
Cool.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.680
Wow, that must be a fucking relief

09:13.680 --> 09:15.920
considering I probably think about it once a day.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.240
Yeah.

09:16.240 --> 09:16.640
Really?

09:16.640 --> 09:18.640
Are you kidding me?

09:18.640 --> 09:19.920
You are both homeowners.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.480
My dumpster gets removed and put back

09:22.480 --> 09:24.400
without my knowledge every week.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.280
My relationship is such that I put some really...

09:31.280 --> 09:33.280
I put some off the grid stuff out there.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.520
Things that I don't expect them to take,

09:35.520 --> 09:36.800
but they always do take it.

09:36.800 --> 09:37.280
Yeah.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.240
And then sometimes there's a lot of boxes

09:40.240 --> 09:41.680
because I got on a wild tear

09:41.680 --> 09:44.880
and started ordering a bunch of garbage from eBay,

09:44.880 --> 09:46.880
like a bunch of FMV games from eBay.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.800
There's boxes upon boxes out there.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.360
And I'm so certain they hate my guts that...

09:51.360 --> 09:53.600
Well, one, obviously, as everyone should,

09:53.600 --> 09:56.400
I tip them at Christmas time, just run out there

09:56.400 --> 09:59.920
and hand them a little bonus, get their beaks wet.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.680
But I have actually taken to...

10:01.680 --> 10:02.960
Oh God, this is embarrassing.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.080
I've actually taken to when the garbage men come,

10:06.080 --> 10:07.840
I take my daughter outside

10:07.840 --> 10:11.680
and pretend that she loves garbage trucks as me and your children do.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.000
To try to soften the relationship.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
She waves to them and they wave back.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.720
And I think there's no way they're gonna be mad at me anymore

10:18.720 --> 10:19.600
after this one.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.920
I would like to be on the garbage men side of that

10:21.920 --> 10:23.280
where they're just like,

10:23.280 --> 10:24.800
we're never coming back to the...

10:24.800 --> 10:26.000
Oh, a little curl.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.960
All right, one more week.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.760
All right, one more.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.760
We'll come back, we'll do them one more day.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.800
I go really hard on Bulk Trash Pickup Day,

10:32.800 --> 10:35.200
so much so that I've stopped getting the flyers telling me

10:35.200 --> 10:36.400
when that day is.

10:36.400 --> 10:36.880
What is this?

10:36.880 --> 10:37.280
I don't understand.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.720
Bulk Trash Pickup Day is just like,

10:38.720 --> 10:40.800
it's literally just anything goes.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.000
That was the original name of it.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.040
It's like your couch day.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.480
Yeah, just like fucking whatever, dog.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.920
Throw your life away day.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.560
And so I get worried that they're just gonna stop coming to my house.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.720
And so I have a big pile in my garage of good trash

10:56.720 --> 10:59.760
that I will put on top of the bad trash

10:59.760 --> 11:03.280
to try and entice them into grabbing my can.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.640
So underneath the...

11:05.520 --> 11:07.840
I'll spend all day throwing away old onions

11:07.840 --> 11:11.760
and stinky peppers and all kinds of stuff,

11:11.760 --> 11:15.760
just a compost and old racist newspapers,

11:15.760 --> 11:17.600
just putting all that bad trash in there.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.120
And then on top of that,

11:19.120 --> 11:23.360
I'll layer the box of an imported perfume

11:24.320 --> 11:25.520
and I'll put that on top.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.240
And so they open it and A, they'll see it and be like,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.400
this is some good trash.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.680
We love this guy.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.600
And B, if they wanna just take that good trash for their own,

11:37.680 --> 11:38.560
That's not how it works.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.040
Well, if they wanna stick it to their backs,

11:41.040 --> 11:43.040
like the trash people in the labyrinth.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.680
Yeah, to make themselves bigger and more protected,

11:45.680 --> 11:47.040
then they can do that.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.800
I think they would take it

11:48.800 --> 11:51.280
and they go back to the trash offices

11:51.280 --> 11:52.960
and then they show it to all their friends.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.120
Like, look what I found today, boys.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.640
It's a perfume box.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.920
I don't even know where it's from.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.280
I think Azerbaijan.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.840
No, they get frisked every day.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.640
So that would be impossible.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.440
Oh, we can't leave.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.280
No, no, no, you don't leave with the nice trash,

12:05.280 --> 12:07.440
but you can hide it in your locker

12:07.440 --> 12:08.480
and show it to your friends.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.760
Maybe what you wanna do to fix this back up

12:11.760 --> 12:13.920
is to take Griffin's plan one step further.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.680
And when they lift the lid off the trash,

12:15.680 --> 12:18.640
you just spread some bills around the top of the trash.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.400
Like there's just some like 20s,

12:20.400 --> 12:21.600
maybe a 50 or two in there.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.240
Be careful though,

12:22.240 --> 12:23.280
cause they don't always open.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.200
Here's the thing about garbage people.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.840
They don't always lift the can lid up

12:27.840 --> 12:29.920
to see if you've hidden good trash in there

12:29.920 --> 12:31.920
for them to take home to their wife and child.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.720
You're gonna have to hang a note from the tree.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.000
Money in this.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.320
Yes, but it can't say good trash

12:38.320 --> 12:40.160
because then anybody would come get it.

12:40.160 --> 12:40.640
Dammit.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.000
Not only that,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.120
if they don't open up the lid

12:43.120 --> 12:44.560
and you throw away all those bills,

12:44.560 --> 12:47.040
you've done a federal crime.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.320
You have to do a secret code

12:48.320 --> 12:50.160
that only the garbage will understand.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.800
Something like bad trash, too stinky for all.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.040
Yeah.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.480
Avoid at all costs.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.400
Banana peels, wink emoji.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.920
For trash eyes only.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.280
Yeah, cause that's what they,

12:59.280 --> 13:01.040
that's what sort of like script.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.400
They bring home,

13:02.400 --> 13:04.320
how many cans did you bring in today, Roger?

13:04.320 --> 13:06.240
And Roger's like 400 cans.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.480
It's like, damn, here's 20 banana peels.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.440
And that's how they pay them.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.720
Oh, that's the company store?

13:10.720 --> 13:11.600
That's the company store.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.880
And then you trade in the banana peels

13:12.880 --> 13:14.320
for uneaten bananas.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.240
So it's like a one in one out sort of economy.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.120
That's solid recycling.

13:17.120 --> 13:17.760
Yeah, dude.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.760
Like all the nanners you want essentially.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.480
My relationship with them has improved

13:22.480 --> 13:23.040
to the point.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.080
I'll tell you how it fell apart.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.080
We have, instead of bulk trash pickup day,

13:26.080 --> 13:27.920
we have like, you call the city and say,

13:27.920 --> 13:30.000
hey, listen, once a month you can call

13:30.000 --> 13:31.680
and it's like, no questions asked.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.120
As dirty as you want to be.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.560
All bets are off.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, nastiest you can get.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.800
Just like, whatever.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.080
And a lot of times it's like furniture

13:38.080 --> 13:39.200
that I'm getting rid of our place.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.480
Cause you know, we did that thing

13:40.480 --> 13:41.680
when we first got married.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.120
It was just like buying like

13:43.120 --> 13:44.400
whatever we could cobble together

13:44.400 --> 13:45.200
at Target or whatever.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.480
And then we're like, okay, well,

13:46.480 --> 13:49.040
this is falling apart cause it costs $20.

13:49.040 --> 13:49.360
Yeah.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.480
So I need to dispose of it.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.920
And I left it out there

13:51.920 --> 13:53.200
and then called the city,

13:53.760 --> 13:56.160
but I left, I put it out there on trash day

13:56.160 --> 13:57.520
and then the trash guys took it,

13:57.520 --> 13:58.880
but I'd already called and I want to say,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.720
no, no, no, this isn't for you.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.920
I understand.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.600
This is like above and beyond trash.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.560
You don't have to do this.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.280
You're better than this.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.560
Don't take this heat.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.400
You can't stand this heat.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.160
I know it's probably just you coming back

14:10.160 --> 14:12.160
with a different truck later, but like,

14:12.160 --> 14:13.040
don't take this heat.

14:13.040 --> 14:13.840
You can't handle it.

14:13.840 --> 14:14.320
Can we take-

14:14.320 --> 14:14.880
But then they did.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.400
So that's how I got mad at me.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.240
Can we take a second to address the fact

14:18.240 --> 14:22.000
that like, if you work at all

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
in like the trash collection industry,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.520
you are a fucking hero.

14:25.520 --> 14:25.840
Yeah.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.040
I don't know how you do.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.800
Like, I don't like to touch my own trash,

14:28.800 --> 14:31.040
let alone the trash of hundreds of strangers.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.520
The very idea of trash makes me very sad.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.120
Like not sad, like, oh,

14:35.120 --> 14:37.280
look at all this trash is being thrown away,

14:37.280 --> 14:40.160
but that I have to deal with it in my own home

14:40.160 --> 14:41.360
makes me sad.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.000
And I wish that there were a robot to do it for me.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.920
So the fact that you like do it

14:45.920 --> 14:48.480
and take that heat for us.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.600
I just want to take a moment

14:49.600 --> 14:52.480
if you're listening to know that I appreciate you.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.240
Hey, actually, if you are listening,

14:54.240 --> 14:55.840
maybe we get a new segment out of this,

14:55.840 --> 14:57.840
like weird trash stories.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.360
Like what's the weirdest thing

14:59.360 --> 15:00.560
that anybody's ever thrown away

15:00.560 --> 15:01.760
that you've ever collected?

15:01.760 --> 15:04.560
Just write in with the subject line trash stories.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.520
And I don't want to hear it

15:05.520 --> 15:07.040
if you're not in the industry.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.200
I want to hear from people who are like in the biz

15:09.200 --> 15:10.800
or have been in the biz at one point.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.520
Send us a JPEG of your own personal treasure hoard

15:15.520 --> 15:18.000
of the great trash that you found over the years.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.640
And you've just kind of squirreled it away in your den.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.400
If the Trash Comedy Minute works

15:22.400 --> 15:24.560
starring Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen

15:24.560 --> 15:25.760
have taught me anything,

15:25.760 --> 15:28.160
it's that trash people go through the trash.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.720
They show like funny things that they show to each other.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.520
Love that.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.520
Then they, I think, get wrapped up

15:33.520 --> 15:35.680
in like maybe a kidnapping or some kind of-

15:35.680 --> 15:36.880
They probably get kidnapped.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.920
Crime syndicate.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.600
I can't remember what happens in that movie

15:39.600 --> 15:41.360
after the point where they're rummaging

15:41.360 --> 15:42.640
through other people's trash.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.800
But like, I know there's funny stories.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.360
Dude, you know it's fucking funny though.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.320
Yeah.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.880
One time I had a trash can that I hated

15:50.880 --> 15:53.120
and you can't get rid of trash cans you hate

15:53.120 --> 15:54.400
because what are you gonna do?

15:54.400 --> 15:55.760
Put them in a bigger can?

15:55.760 --> 15:56.880
It's ridiculous.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.040
So one time when there was a windstorm,

15:59.040 --> 16:02.480
I saw that my trash can had been blown across the street

16:02.480 --> 16:06.880
and down a steep driveway into like my neighbor's backyard.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.480
And I just thought, this is good.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.840
Jesus, take the wheel.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.880
Jesus, take the wheel.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.640
He's migrated.

16:12.640 --> 16:17.440
Three days later in what is honestly like kind of infuriating

16:17.440 --> 16:19.040
but obviously it was a miracle.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.200
They brought it in.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.480
They found it on their doorstep.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.440
They're like, oh, little fella,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.280
you seem to be in need of a home.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.200
You're gonna be our trash can now.

16:27.200 --> 16:27.520
Yeah.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.120
And I was like, oh, thank God I can buy a new,

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
better trash can because I hate that old one.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.400
But I still kind of resented it

16:32.400 --> 16:33.760
because they didn't try to find an owner.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.520
They didn't go door to door knocking.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.080
Just one day go over there just like, that's mine.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.800
Yeah.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.600
Do you want a Yahoo?

16:40.240 --> 16:40.960
Please.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.720
This one was sent in by Morgan Davey

16:42.720 --> 16:45.360
who sent in so many fucking amazing ones

16:45.360 --> 16:48.960
that I feel like we need to give them a title.

16:51.200 --> 16:56.000
And I think that Morgan Davey's Yahoo gravy

16:56.000 --> 16:58.880
is like we could refer to like the ones that they send in.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.000
Okay, I love that.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.680
I think here comes a dollop of that Morgan Davey Yahoo gravy.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.400
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.440
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.200
Has this platform just completely collapsed?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.840
It does nothing on this fucking platform work anymore?

17:12.720 --> 17:13.840
This is the last.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.480
I'm not kidding.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.920
I think they're just, I think they're slow pulling it slowly,

17:17.920 --> 17:20.880
falling slowly like the movie wants.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.040
Anyway, George asks,

17:26.400 --> 17:30.240
has anyone invented a pornographic kite?

17:31.440 --> 17:31.680
What?

17:32.320 --> 17:35.200
Has anyone invented a pornographic kite?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.800
I think it would be a great idea.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.800
Imagine how excited you would be to teach a child

17:38.800 --> 17:40.560
how to fly a stupid kite.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.040
If you know there's going to be boobs on it,

17:43.040 --> 17:45.440
as soon as God's grace it into the air,

17:46.240 --> 17:49.920
I would pay good money for a breast kite.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.160
And I think that's, I think that's close by.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.360
I think we could do any sort of pornographic material

17:55.360 --> 17:56.400
on the kite.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.360
Yeah, I feel like boobs is just so.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.160
Let's not say that.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.280
Let's just not say the word.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.200
Bosoms.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.000
I think bosoms is far to A to B.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.360
Let's A to C this stuff.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.160
Let's A to D it.

18:10.160 --> 18:10.880
You know what I mean?

18:10.880 --> 18:12.560
Like let's make it a deck on there.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.680
Or I'm saying full on like scene.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.680
Yeah, no, it'll be a scene.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.880
It's, it'll be a scene, Trav.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.240
No matter what, this porn kite is going to be a scene.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.360
But here's the thing, Griffin.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.920
I feel like the question asker is only envisioning

18:25.920 --> 18:28.080
a printed on scenario.

18:28.080 --> 18:32.640
I'm saying this is a kite shaped like a pornographic scene.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.680
Oh, see, okay.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.000
You've really jumped from A to D there, Trav.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.640
Cause I think we're not even on, we're not even on B yet.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.920
So let's start the.

18:39.920 --> 18:40.880
B is for bosoms.

18:41.440 --> 18:41.680
Okay.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.760
I think it's just a kite with a pornographic scene on it.

18:45.760 --> 18:50.720
And if you fly a kite that has nudity on it at a park

18:50.720 --> 18:53.920
or a beach or an airport, don't do it in an airport.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.280
Actually, I just thought about it.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.280
You're going to get sucked into the jets.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.520
Well, or at the very least you'll get tangled up on the wing

18:59.520 --> 19:02.160
and then we, you're flying around outside of the plane.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.280
It's going to be one of those two though.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.040
All those little prints constantly.

19:07.040 --> 19:07.360
Yeah.

19:07.360 --> 19:11.200
One of those mission impossible ghost protocols.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.640
And so you're flying the kite and it has nudity on it.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.360
And then I think nobody could really get mad at you

19:19.360 --> 19:21.760
cause it's all the way up in the sky.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.000
And you can be like, you can't even prove that's mine.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.200
It's way up in the sky.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.400
They're all waiting for it to land to prove that it's pornographic.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.560
And that's your challenge to keep it up in the air

19:30.560 --> 19:31.680
until they all go home.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.160
Your, your, the only response,

19:34.160 --> 19:36.400
I think you could have a pretty good cover

19:36.400 --> 19:38.480
is if you act like it surprised you,

19:38.480 --> 19:39.600
but you don't know what to do now.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.800
Oh, come on, come on, get back down here.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.760
This is ridiculous.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.680
I swear when I went up, it had clothes on.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.800
I don't know what happened.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.280
Oh, it blew, the wind blew its clothes off.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.160
Oh man.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.520
Oh, I like that move.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.400
I mean, the wind, the wind, come on.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.480
I'm saying the easier sell is if it's all the way up in the sky,

19:58.480 --> 20:01.360
you can disavow ownership of the kite

20:01.360 --> 20:03.040
because it's so far up there.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.600
Nobody, how, how can you prove that this is mine?

20:06.560 --> 20:08.160
Oh, like it's in the stratosphere.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.120
Like, oh, it's this, this kite belongs to God now.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.240
Right.

20:12.240 --> 20:16.400
I might be holding a string that is tethering the kite to terra firma,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.000
but that doesn't, I don't own it.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.080
It's so, it's so, it's so far up in the sky.

20:22.080 --> 20:22.880
You know what I mean?

20:22.880 --> 20:26.000
Like if I, if you have a porno balloon and you let go of it,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.960
you let go of it, it's this, it's, it's in the sky.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.000
I can't own this.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.240
They actually can't arrest you either

20:32.240 --> 20:34.560
because the crime is happening in the sky.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.280
So as we all know, it falls under avian law.

20:37.280 --> 20:37.600
Yeah.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.240
And they cannot arrest you for that because you're on the ground.

20:40.800 --> 20:40.960
Yeah.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.240
You're out of their jurisdiction.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.040
Like they can kind of like look, like the bird cops can kind of look at like,

20:45.040 --> 20:46.240
ugh, these guys.

20:46.240 --> 20:46.640
Distasteful.

20:46.640 --> 20:51.200
Again, I think the best porno kite you could have

20:51.200 --> 20:56.480
have rather than like obviously a lentricular scene that evolves as you,

20:56.480 --> 20:57.600
as it flies through the air.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.400
That would be amazing.

20:58.960 --> 21:04.560
I would like to see kind of just like a naked man who is aware that he's flying.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.880
So he's sort of like, so he's like living two dreams at once.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.280
Like, wow, why is this happening?

21:11.280 --> 21:11.520
Yeah.

21:12.240 --> 21:18.640
Lentricular material, I think will be too heavy to catch, to take flight, unfortunately.

21:18.640 --> 21:18.960
Yes.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.320
Yes, but I think we could get the naked man dream going.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.400
Does he have his arms up over his head like Superman?

21:25.120 --> 21:25.360
Yeah.

21:25.360 --> 21:29.120
And it's a human sized kite and the background is clear.

21:29.120 --> 21:33.680
So you just looked up there and be like, holy shit, Superman done lost his mind.

21:34.240 --> 21:40.320
Now the thing is, Justin, I'm going to say my worry here is it's not pornographic enough.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.040
It sounds like it's just-

21:41.040 --> 21:42.720
Because there's nothing pornographic about it.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.000
Well, it's just nudity.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.040
You know what I mean?

21:45.040 --> 21:47.120
Like that's, that is a nude kite.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.960
Well, you got to give him a facial expression that looks like he's up to something.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.040
Yeah, I don't know.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.280
Yeah.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.240
I know it when I see it, you know, and that certainly has a look.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.960
He certainly has a look of like surprise at flight, but also-

22:00.560 --> 22:02.320
Maybe he's cranking his hog.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.760
That's one thing that could happen.

22:07.760 --> 22:13.760
And maybe that the hog crank sort of mechanism is attached to the string.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.120
And so you can really just get it going.

22:18.400 --> 22:18.880
Vroom.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.400
That's not the kite sound, but kites don't have a sound.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.320
You wind it up with the rubber band real tight before you let it go.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.520
And then once it's up there, just like off to the races.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.400
And when the rubber band runs out, it just drifts back to earth.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.080
And that's the end.

22:35.920 --> 22:36.640
Everybody go home.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.680
The kids get out of here.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.960
I think my favorite part of this question is the word inventing.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.080
Yeah, because I would like to see that laboratory.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.640
I'm just saying invented is a weird way to put it.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.920
When was the last time someone invented any kind of kite

22:49.920 --> 22:51.680
rather than just like making a kite?

22:52.240 --> 22:54.080
Doug Funny's dad invented the fighter kite.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.360
That was the most pornographic episode of Dogfighter.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.000
Yeah, that's true.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.320
Because then Mr. Fink, was that his name?

23:04.320 --> 23:04.640
Frank?

23:05.440 --> 23:06.560
What's his fucking name?

23:06.560 --> 23:08.080
Mr. Funny is Doug Funny's dad.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.720
Well, but then he had the weird neighbor who was also an inventor.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.360
Who was like, Mr. Dink was like,

23:13.360 --> 23:14.960
yeah, let's put some dogs on there.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.360
And then Roger Clodz is like, sexy kite funny.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.840
That's really good, Griffin.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.400
Griffin, you've been hiding a perfect Roger Clodz under a bush.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.320
That was really good Roger Clodz.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.800
I'm gonna crank my hog to that later, Funny.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.440
Well, hold on.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.680
Watch me crank my hog, Funny.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.200
Oh, no, no, no.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.760
No, not like this.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.600
No, no, this is ruined.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.080
I recently moved into a shared house

23:48.080 --> 23:50.560
and have several new roommates, four of us own cars,

23:50.560 --> 23:52.880
but there's only one parking space in the driveway,

23:52.880 --> 23:56.720
which has been claimed by the person who has lived there the longest.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.480
Every other place I've lived was treated the driveway

23:58.480 --> 23:59.600
like a first come first serve.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.520
As the newest member of the household,

24:01.520 --> 24:02.720
I don't wanna rock the boat too much

24:02.720 --> 24:04.560
by questioning the validity of their claim,

24:04.560 --> 24:07.840
but it hardly seems fair they should have the driveway reserved for them

24:07.840 --> 24:11.040
based on seniority while the rest of us battle for street parking.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.560
Is their claim acceptable?

24:12.560 --> 24:15.040
Do I risk creating drama by bringing it up?

24:15.040 --> 24:18.320
Added info, this person isn't someone I wanna make a fight with.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.280
They're opinionated, hot-headed, and controlling.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.760
That's from Powerless Parker in Portland.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.280
I've been watching Deadwood for the first time,

24:27.280 --> 24:29.440
and let me say this about vis-a-vis claims.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.720
You guys watch out about stepping on claims

24:32.720 --> 24:35.680
because that's how you end up getting pigs.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.360
If anybody says that they wanna reconnoiter the parking space-

24:39.360 --> 24:41.920
Yeah, you ain't gonna reconnoiter shit, dog.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.960
Don't do it.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.800
You're gonna get flung.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.400
I have a plan for this person.

24:48.400 --> 24:48.960
All right.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.360
I've been playing the Game of Thrones board game.

24:51.360 --> 24:55.520
A lot of HBO sort of dramas are sort of informing our strategy this time.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.040
Yeah, and in the Game of Thrones board game,

24:59.040 --> 25:01.920
there's like, there's victory tracks.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.640
Okay.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.480
And you, like, if you wanna hold the Iron Throne,

25:07.360 --> 25:09.600
you do it through bidding with your power.

25:10.560 --> 25:14.400
So what if, rather than, like, you all bid money

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
to see who gets the parking space,

25:18.160 --> 25:20.240
and when the person who wins,

25:20.240 --> 25:24.480
that money goes to buy dinner for the other people in the house?

25:24.480 --> 25:25.760
Are you fucking kidding?

25:25.760 --> 25:28.720
Like, to, here's what you'll get.

25:28.720 --> 25:34.720
Either one nice dinner, or not have to street park for a year.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.240
Well, but hear me, I'm not done.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.720
At any point, well, let's say after a week,

25:40.720 --> 25:45.440
anytime after a week, someone can call a new bid to order.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.760
Maybe they've had, like, a bonus at work,

25:47.760 --> 25:49.920
or they had, like, a really good sale,

25:49.920 --> 25:53.680
or they sold off their Xbox so that they could park at the driveway,

25:53.680 --> 25:56.000
and they call a new bid,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.800
and so everybody bids again,

25:58.800 --> 26:00.320
and it's constantly up for grabs.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.840
There's gonna be a lot of power struggle.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.880
I don't think it's gonna make things easier,

26:04.880 --> 26:07.120
but I've watched a lot of Game of Thrones,

26:07.120 --> 26:10.240
and I think it's gonna be a lot sexier, a lot more exciting.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.800
There's gonna be a lot of intrigue, a lot of whispers.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.360
Someone's gonna be probably killed.

26:16.160 --> 26:16.960
Little birds.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.600
Little birds.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.920
They're doing their thing.

26:20.800 --> 26:21.040
Dragons.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.080
Here's the night.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.160
Building off of Travis's bad idea with a good one.

26:24.160 --> 26:24.880
Well, hold on.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.000
It just needs some polish.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.160
Well, allow me.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.600
What if you put a price on the parking space?

26:31.600 --> 26:34.480
So you said, hey, listen, I want your parking space.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.680
I'm willing to pay 50 more dollars in rent per month,

26:37.680 --> 26:41.280
and that is a trickle-down benefit to everybody else.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.760
So you can either take $50 off that person's rent

26:43.760 --> 26:45.920
or split it up with the rest of the house.

26:45.920 --> 26:49.520
Everybody's winning, and you're just flaunting your affluence.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.320
Because if, honestly, you don't want first come, first serve,

26:52.320 --> 26:53.040
that's a nightmare.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.240
You'll never leave the house.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.240
All your ideas have been bad so far.

26:56.240 --> 26:56.720
Okay.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.220
Okay.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.320
The right answer is all of you sell your cars.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.280
Hold on.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.000
This is a little Give to the Magi, Griffin.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.800
No, no, no.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.320
Well, you haven't let me fucking finish.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.400
This would be like if Give to the Magi was like,

27:10.400 --> 27:12.240
I need a watch band.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.200
I love my hair.

27:13.200 --> 27:13.700
The end.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.080
No.

27:16.080 --> 27:16.960
You sell all your cars.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.000
You put all that money in a pool.

27:18.000 --> 27:18.880
You buy...

27:18.880 --> 27:20.000
There's four of you?

27:20.000 --> 27:20.500
Yes.

27:20.500 --> 27:24.900
You buy four scooters, right?

27:24.900 --> 27:27.060
Scooters are much smaller, much more fun to ride,

27:27.060 --> 27:29.380
very usable in Portland.

27:29.380 --> 27:32.500
You have a scooter race, and then whoever wins the race

27:32.500 --> 27:34.500
gets to use the driveway.

27:34.500 --> 27:34.980
But if you have four...

27:34.980 --> 27:36.180
They can buy their car back.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.300
And they'd try their car back.

27:37.300 --> 27:37.700
You have to...

27:37.700 --> 27:39.940
Everybody else, oh, that's it, Justin.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.300
We're doing this shit for pinks.

27:42.340 --> 27:45.540
You do the scooter race, whoever wins gets all the scooters,

27:45.540 --> 27:48.980
can sell as many scooters as they want to buy back a car

27:48.980 --> 27:51.220
that then they get to use in the driveway.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.980
And nobody else has cars anymore.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.740
So you don't have to worry about parking them on the street.

27:56.020 --> 27:56.260
So...

27:56.900 --> 28:00.420
You know, in the short live HBO series, Vinyl,

28:02.260 --> 28:03.140
I don't actually...

28:03.140 --> 28:04.420
I didn't actually watch Vinyl.

28:04.420 --> 28:04.980
Okay.

28:04.980 --> 28:06.900
I could tell you guys about Entourage.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.540
There's the episode where Vince buys everybody a car.

28:09.540 --> 28:10.340
Does that help here?

28:10.340 --> 28:13.780
In the television show, Big Love, a very tall man

28:13.780 --> 28:17.860
loves a very tall woman as well, just very much.

28:17.860 --> 28:21.220
And it's sort of like a good romance story.

28:21.780 --> 28:23.300
And so just love each other.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.140
And just like the car thing will work itself out.

28:26.180 --> 28:26.900
That's beautiful.

28:26.900 --> 28:27.860
That's really good.

28:27.860 --> 28:28.820
Beautiful, Griffin.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.220
Did...

28:29.220 --> 28:29.860
Who's the...

28:29.860 --> 28:31.220
Okay, I do have to say though,

28:31.220 --> 28:34.260
you entered into this house understanding this arrangement.

28:34.260 --> 28:36.420
I don't know if the fault lies with you

28:37.060 --> 28:39.780
for not understanding the politics before you moved in,

28:39.780 --> 28:43.940
or the fault lies with the others for bringing in a usurper.

28:43.940 --> 28:46.980
You probably had a look about you of a usurper.

28:46.980 --> 28:47.540
Oh, yes.

28:47.540 --> 28:49.620
The fact that they would still bring you into their home.

28:49.620 --> 28:51.540
Maybe the blame is on them.

28:51.540 --> 28:52.340
I don't know.

28:52.340 --> 28:55.220
They should be screening better for usurpers.

28:55.220 --> 28:56.260
At the very least, you...

28:56.900 --> 28:57.460
I don't know.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.860
I just feel like some kind of monthly rotation.

29:00.420 --> 29:00.740
Yeah.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.460
There you go.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.100
That's nice.

29:02.900 --> 29:03.620
That's good.

29:03.620 --> 29:06.660
Something where it's just like we all acknowledge that this is...

29:06.660 --> 29:10.500
Because right now this is so non-mutually beneficial

29:10.500 --> 29:12.100
and so ironclad.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.500
Like this person is a despot.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.260
This person who has been there the longest

29:16.260 --> 29:19.460
and says the car is mine is a despot and must be overthrown.

29:20.660 --> 29:21.780
Hey, how about you just...

29:21.780 --> 29:23.060
Hey, listen, come close.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.020
How about you just fucking park?

29:26.020 --> 29:27.700
Just fucking park there.

29:27.700 --> 29:28.820
What are they gonna do?

29:28.820 --> 29:29.320
Yeah.

29:29.780 --> 29:31.620
Then, oh, you don't like my car there?

29:31.620 --> 29:34.100
Go outside and lift it, tough guy.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.380
Go outside and pick it up and move it somewhere.

29:35.380 --> 29:35.780
Well, wait.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.220
It sounds like this person could do that

29:37.220 --> 29:38.180
because they're very big.

29:38.740 --> 29:41.220
If they do that, then they earn the spot.

29:41.220 --> 29:42.020
They deserve it.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.220
And that gives you a reason to go get cut

29:45.220 --> 29:46.900
so you can lift their car up.

29:46.900 --> 29:47.620
Oh, I like this.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.940
It becomes a strong man competition.

29:49.940 --> 29:50.820
Exactly.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.020
What if it's Brock Lesnar, though,

29:52.020 --> 29:53.140
and he just eats the car?

29:54.180 --> 29:54.900
That's another...

29:55.540 --> 29:57.220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.020
Eat his car.

29:58.580 --> 30:01.140
If you eat his car piece by piece

30:01.140 --> 30:04.260
at a pace at which he will not recognize it's happening

30:04.260 --> 30:05.860
and then one day he goes

30:05.860 --> 30:08.180
and he parks his rear view mirror out there

30:08.180 --> 30:08.820
and he's like, man,

30:08.820 --> 30:11.460
this thing just doesn't have the get up and go it used to.

30:11.460 --> 30:12.900
You eat that last piece.

30:12.900 --> 30:14.420
And he's like, I thought I had a car.

30:14.420 --> 30:15.460
I guess not.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.900
And you are dead.

30:17.460 --> 30:19.780
But there is a good thing that you could park there

30:19.780 --> 30:20.500
whenever you want.

30:21.300 --> 30:21.860
Just real quick.

30:21.860 --> 30:23.620
Dad just texted all of us.

30:24.820 --> 30:28.180
Ask is just saying that he's about to make a jungle gyms run

30:28.180 --> 30:30.740
and wants to know if we want him to pick us up any food.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.500
Can you text him and see,

30:36.500 --> 30:39.060
ask if they have any instant horchata?

30:39.060 --> 30:40.500
I would just love a bag of that.

30:40.500 --> 30:40.740
Okay.

30:40.740 --> 30:42.420
I had some at the beach and it was top.

30:42.420 --> 30:43.220
Well, that is...

30:43.220 --> 30:44.100
Well, that would be for you.

30:44.100 --> 30:45.460
So I think you could probably swing that.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.580
Maybe when we're done recording,

30:46.580 --> 30:46.980
I'm gonna...

30:46.980 --> 30:48.260
I'm recording a podcast right now.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.180
Travis says a bag of pig buttholes.

30:51.380 --> 30:51.860
So this is,

30:51.860 --> 30:53.940
we're having a lot of fun with this text chain with our dad.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.300
I'm gonna put a corollary on Travis

30:58.420 --> 30:59.860
that he wants Cajun flavor.

30:59.860 --> 31:00.180
Yeah.

31:00.180 --> 31:02.100
But make sure you blast those butts.

31:02.100 --> 31:15.940
Let's go to the Money Town.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.860
I wanna tell everybody about how I sleep.

31:18.660 --> 31:21.940
I have a little pillow shaped like a crunch bar

31:21.940 --> 31:24.100
that I nestle into my arms.

31:24.740 --> 31:27.140
It's a Nestle's crunch bar for nestling in my arms.

31:27.140 --> 31:32.260
That's a super weird way to do your sleeping, I think.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.260
Well, I used to have a log shaped pillow,

31:34.260 --> 31:36.980
but I just upgraded to this crunch bar pillow.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.260
This log shaped pillow,

31:38.260 --> 31:39.060
sorry, just a quick side.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.060
You used to take it with you traveling everywhere

31:41.060 --> 31:43.780
and you would sort of hang it from a strap of your backpack.

31:43.780 --> 31:44.980
And when you did that,

31:44.980 --> 31:46.740
and I do not wanna get blue here folks,

31:46.740 --> 31:54.580
but it was like a diagram of a scrotum with testes

31:54.580 --> 31:57.300
that they might have at like a doctor's office

31:57.300 --> 32:00.500
or like maybe they would bring it to like a middle school

32:00.500 --> 32:03.940
to like teach boys about like sort of their pezone down there.

32:03.940 --> 32:08.340
So clinical was this diagram that Justin would take with him

32:08.340 --> 32:10.580
just walking around like his backpack had truck nuts

32:10.580 --> 32:13.380
as he went to E3 or Pax East or what have you.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.180
Yes, that's true.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.820
I did have truck nuts for my backpack,

32:18.820 --> 32:24.740
but now that part is done with and now we've moved on

32:24.740 --> 32:26.100
to the crunch pillow.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.860
Anyway, this is like not the point,

32:27.860 --> 32:30.500
but the point is I'm sleeping on Bowling Branch sheets

32:30.500 --> 32:32.020
and they're the most comfortable,

32:32.020 --> 32:34.820
best sheets that I've ever slept on in my entire life.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.420
Whether you're a four hour night type

32:36.420 --> 32:37.860
or more like a 10 hour night type,

32:37.860 --> 32:40.420
Bowling Branch makes getting a good night's sleep possible

32:40.420 --> 32:43.060
with their super comfortable sheets.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.420
And they don't just sell sheets,

32:44.420 --> 32:46.020
they have duvet covers,

32:46.020 --> 32:50.660
they have so much great towels, sheets, blankets, everything.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.340
And here's the best part.

32:52.340 --> 32:54.340
If you go online to bowlingbranch.com,

32:54.340 --> 32:56.740
that's B-O-L-L and branch.com,

32:56.740 --> 32:59.140
they'll let you try them risk-free for 30 nights.

33:20.980 --> 33:24.580

33:25.620 --> 33:26.900
Travis, tell me all about trunk clothes

33:26.900 --> 33:29.220
because I know you've been getting your fashion game, right?

33:30.100 --> 33:32.740
So we all like pants, right?

33:33.540 --> 33:37.300
I disagree with the whole sort of premise of your assertion.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.260
So listen, here's the thing.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.700
I was recently talking with people

33:39.700 --> 33:42.820
about this whole cargo shorts thing.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.580
We're not gonna get into that here,

33:44.580 --> 33:47.140
but I was talking with people about fashion

33:48.340 --> 33:50.260
and somebody made the claim of like,

33:50.260 --> 33:51.540
I don't care about fashion.

33:51.540 --> 33:53.140
Fashion is not important to me.

33:53.140 --> 33:55.220
And listen, I understand that.

33:55.220 --> 33:56.180
I feel the same way.

33:56.180 --> 33:57.780
I don't know two shits about fashion,

33:58.340 --> 33:59.700
but I went into trunk club.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.500
I did like a fitting with a stylist

34:02.500 --> 34:06.580
and what I ended up with, and I can't stress this enough,

34:07.140 --> 34:10.980
the best looking and most comfortable pair of jeans

34:10.980 --> 34:13.380
I've ever owned in my entire life.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.780
Like I don't know what it is about them,

34:15.780 --> 34:17.380
but they both look great

34:17.940 --> 34:20.340
and they are my favorite pair of pants to wear.

34:21.220 --> 34:24.500
And so that was my first kind of view into the fact

34:24.500 --> 34:28.340
that maybe this fashion thing is onto something

34:29.060 --> 34:30.260
and it's not just about looking good,

34:30.260 --> 34:31.620
but it's also about feeling good.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.620
So if you've been away from fashion

34:33.620 --> 34:36.260
because you don't know, I got two words for you.

34:36.260 --> 34:37.460
Trunk club.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.140
Trunk club.

34:39.140 --> 34:39.700
Trunk club.

34:39.700 --> 34:40.740
Trunk club.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.500
You can maybe make it into one word,

34:42.500 --> 34:43.700
but that's not what it is.

34:43.700 --> 34:44.580
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.020
What it is is you go on trunk club,

34:46.020 --> 34:48.500
you tell them what kind of clothes you're looking for

34:48.500 --> 34:51.460
and what kind of events like you would wear them to

34:51.460 --> 34:53.780
for work, for parties, for outings,

34:53.780 --> 34:57.060
for fancy occasions, for doing podcast live shows.

34:57.700 --> 34:59.620
And you tell them like what your style is

34:59.620 --> 35:01.460
and they're going to come back at you

35:01.460 --> 35:03.380
with some amazing suggestions.

35:03.380 --> 35:04.740
They're going to ship it to you.

35:05.460 --> 35:07.140
You're gonna try it on.

35:07.140 --> 35:08.500
You're gonna keep what you like.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.780
Ship back what you don't

35:09.780 --> 35:11.380
and you're only going to pay for what you keep.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.260
It's an amazing deal.

35:14.260 --> 35:17.060
And it's like having your own personal stylist

35:17.060 --> 35:18.420
because that's exactly what it is.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.300
I was going to make that into a simile,

35:21.300 --> 35:24.180
but you just do have a stylist.

35:24.180 --> 35:26.660
When you ship the clothes back to them

35:26.660 --> 35:28.180
that you didn't want to wear,

35:28.180 --> 35:30.660
do you include some fun sized candy bars with it

35:30.660 --> 35:32.820
to just be like, hey, thanks for trying?

35:33.380 --> 35:34.980
I just put some bills in there.

35:34.980 --> 35:38.580
So we're all just kind of about just like giving money

35:38.580 --> 35:40.980
to people who were afraid we've upset for some reason

35:40.980 --> 35:42.820
or will upset in the future.

35:42.820 --> 35:43.860
I don't want them to be mad at me

35:43.860 --> 35:45.460
because I didn't like that pair of pants.

35:46.020 --> 35:48.500
So here's, there's $20 in the pocket.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.700
And there's a three musketeers,

35:49.700 --> 35:50.740
but oh, it's melted all over.

35:50.740 --> 35:51.940
Oh, the pants are ruined.

35:51.940 --> 35:54.820
Oh God, oh God, please, please not like this.

35:55.940 --> 35:58.180
And so it's expert advice, amazing clothes

35:58.740 --> 36:00.180
and you can get started today

36:00.180 --> 36:03.700
by going to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

and you get your own personal stylist

36:08.980 --> 36:11.300
when you use that code, my brother.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.980
Can you request a name?

36:22.980 --> 36:23.860
We forgot the lyrics.

36:25.940 --> 36:28.580
Can you request the name of the stylist that you want?

36:29.380 --> 36:32.500
Can I be like, I want someone named Trey

36:32.500 --> 36:34.980
to tell me what kind of vest to wear.

36:36.340 --> 36:40.500
I want a Bernice to be like, here's your vest Griffin.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.580
And listen, here's the coolest part for me.

36:42.580 --> 36:44.900
If you live in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles,

36:44.900 --> 36:48.660
Chicago, DC, or coming this fall, Charleston, South Carolina,

36:49.460 --> 36:51.940
they have clubhouses where basically

36:51.940 --> 36:54.740
you can go try on the fucking kick in the door.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.260
Like where's Trey at?

36:56.820 --> 36:57.940
Where's Bernice?

36:57.940 --> 36:59.380
I need some pants Trey.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.860
Hey, I got a personal message here.

37:02.580 --> 37:05.300
We do jumbotrons on this show and this is one of them.

37:05.300 --> 37:09.940
It's a message for Kristen and it's from Stone who says,

37:09.940 --> 37:12.020
hey, things are so good that I figured

37:12.020 --> 37:14.180
I would have the brothers relay this message.

37:14.180 --> 37:16.740
I know you won't marry me, but how about we start

37:16.740 --> 37:18.420
that perpetual engagement.

37:18.420 --> 37:21.140
The ring is forthcoming, but a jumbotron is cheaper.

37:21.140 --> 37:22.420
So I started here.

37:22.420 --> 37:24.420
Love you so much and thanks for putting up

37:24.420 --> 37:25.860
with my shit during D&D.

37:25.860 --> 37:29.700
Man, I really hope that Kristen and Stone

37:29.700 --> 37:31.300
are in some kind of a relationship

37:31.300 --> 37:32.740
that doesn't make this weird.

37:32.740 --> 37:34.180
No, it's probably good.

37:34.180 --> 37:36.420
I mean, they're their fellow D&D players, so.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.020
Well, they definitely know each other,

37:38.020 --> 37:41.940
but maybe they've never had any romantic entanglement whatsoever.

37:41.940 --> 37:43.300
Or maybe they have.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.260
I don't know what that noise was.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.860
I'm sorry, it wasn't the noise you made

37:49.860 --> 37:52.100
and I tried to match it, but it came out different.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.740
Stone, we hope you got the desired reaction

37:54.740 --> 37:58.980
from this message that you did for yourself and for Kristen.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.860
I have one for Mike and it's from Skittles Joe,

38:02.980 --> 38:04.420
who I thought was only on Still Buffering,

38:04.420 --> 38:06.020
but I guess he's crossing over.

38:06.020 --> 38:06.980
That fool's everywhere.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.060
Oh God, he's crossing over, get the blasters.

38:10.020 --> 38:13.220
Mike, I'm glad you survived your second fight with an SUV.

38:13.220 --> 38:14.900
I hope the miracles of modern medicine

38:14.900 --> 38:17.060
have helped you get your bones back together

38:17.060 --> 38:19.380
and your lung completely unlacerated.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.420
I look forward to many more years of your friendship,

38:22.420 --> 38:26.020
your wonderful puns and your mockery of the Welsh.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.620
I hope these words from the McElroy brothers

38:27.620 --> 38:28.660
give you a laugh.

38:28.660 --> 38:31.060
Hey, Mike, wanna buy a duck?

38:31.060 --> 38:32.740
I hope they don't give you too big of a laugh

38:32.740 --> 38:34.660
if you're working through some lung stuff.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.660
Man, I hope Mike didn't die.

38:36.660 --> 38:37.220
Man, I hope-

38:37.220 --> 38:37.780
Cool.

38:37.780 --> 38:38.580
No, come on.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.020
Shoo, I just do.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.780
I do hope, I mean, I put that for everybody.

38:41.780 --> 38:42.420
You know what?

38:42.420 --> 38:44.100
I hope Mike never dies.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.700
Well, sure.

38:45.700 --> 38:49.140
I mean, if Mike's taken on two SUVs and been fine,

38:49.140 --> 38:52.420
I think he's kid-tested mother approved at this point.

38:52.420 --> 38:54.260
I don't think you blow Mike down with a-

38:54.260 --> 38:56.660
Yeah, dibs on Mr. Glass, by the way,

38:56.660 --> 38:57.780
if we've got an unbreakable.

38:57.780 --> 38:58.340
Yeah, for sure.

38:58.340 --> 39:00.820
Well, I think Skittles Joe is gonna be the Mr. Glass here,

39:00.820 --> 39:03.700
except his bones are like a bunch of Skittles.

39:04.580 --> 39:06.580
You know those commercials where the guy touches the stuff

39:06.580 --> 39:07.540
and it turns into Skittles?

39:07.540 --> 39:09.540
That's what Skittles, that's what his bones are like.

39:09.540 --> 39:10.340
Oh, poor guy.

39:10.900 --> 39:14.180
Also, Samuel Jackson does not play him in this one,

39:14.180 --> 39:15.060
unfortunately.

39:15.060 --> 39:15.620
Couldn't get him.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.940
This is Samuel M. Jackson.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.940
The next one in the alphabet.

39:21.940 --> 39:24.180
New York City, listen up.

39:24.180 --> 39:26.820
Your fellow MaxFun listeners and hosts are gathering

39:26.820 --> 39:29.140
at Stuart Wellington's New Brooklyn Bar

39:29.140 --> 39:30.340
and you're invited.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.780
You probably know Stuart from his hilarious movie

39:33.780 --> 39:35.300
riffing on the Flophouse,

39:35.300 --> 39:38.420
but did you know he's also a small business owner?

39:39.140 --> 39:39.780
It's true.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.660
Join Stuart and a ton of New MaxFun friends

39:42.660 --> 39:47.140
at the Hinterlands Bar on Saturday, August 27th at 7 p.m.

39:47.140 --> 39:49.940
You can find more information at bit.ly

39:50.980 --> 39:52.820
maxfunhinterlands.

39:53.460 --> 39:54.100
See you there.

39:55.380 --> 39:56.340
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo?

39:57.300 --> 39:57.800
Hit me!

39:58.340 --> 39:59.540
Someone sent in by level 9000,

39:59.540 --> 40:00.580
Yajurijuriju Davenport.

40:00.580 --> 40:00.980
Thank you, Drew.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.660
It's by Yajuru Answers user Kobe.

40:02.660 --> 40:05.700
Now that is a Yahoo Answers website page

40:05.700 --> 40:07.700
that loads good and right.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.140
We got two advertisements.

40:09.140 --> 40:09.940
They're both loading.

40:09.940 --> 40:10.820
They're both animating.

40:10.820 --> 40:11.940
It's going fucking great.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.100
Cody asks.

40:14.100 --> 40:20.980
Kobe asks, is it normal to get aroused by the sight

40:20.980 --> 40:23.140
and smell of garlic bread?

40:25.380 --> 40:27.860
Wow, this is a really sexy episode.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.300
So I was at the dinner table

40:29.300 --> 40:30.900
eating garlic bread with the family

40:30.900 --> 40:33.700
and I started to feel a tingly sensation down there

40:34.420 --> 40:37.220
and I asked to be excused to go to the toilet

40:37.220 --> 40:38.580
and I pulled my pants down.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.740
Oh man, really?

40:40.740 --> 40:42.020
If you are a kid,

40:42.020 --> 40:45.060
if you are a kid, please turn that, please turn the pot.

40:45.060 --> 40:46.420
Sometimes like we do live shows

40:46.420 --> 40:48.900
and like 12 years old come up to us

40:48.900 --> 40:51.140
and like thank you for the, thanks for helping shape us

40:51.140 --> 40:53.060
and I'm like fuck, that's not great, but okay.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.660
But seriously, it's a crime if you don't turn,

40:56.660 --> 40:58.980
it's entrapment if you don't mute the podcast

40:58.980 --> 41:00.020
for the next five seconds.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.500
I asked to be excused to go to the toilet

41:02.500 --> 41:03.780
and I pulled my pants down to find

41:03.780 --> 41:05.540
I was completely drenched.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.380
I don't think this is normal.

41:09.380 --> 41:12.420
What should I do? What?

41:13.140 --> 41:15.460
I'm like this for the Cheddar Bay Biscuits at Red Lobster.

41:16.180 --> 41:18.260
I get there and I get there and it's Shrimp Fest

41:18.260 --> 41:19.380
and I get so excited for Shrimp Fest

41:19.380 --> 41:22.260
that I forget that it's always Cheddar Bay Biscuit Fest

41:22.260 --> 41:23.620
and then I'm just soaked.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.660
God. God bless.

41:28.660 --> 41:29.620
Just soaked through.

41:32.420 --> 41:35.060
Garlic bread's really good sometimes.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.380
If it's that like Texas toast garlic bread

41:37.380 --> 41:39.940
where it's just like you're eating a frisbee-sized piece

41:39.940 --> 41:42.980
of bread and it's lightly garliced on top,

41:42.980 --> 41:44.100
like fuck that shit.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.980
But if we're talking about some knots with some herbs in it

41:46.980 --> 41:49.620
and some garlicky cheesy butter in there.

41:49.620 --> 41:52.420
There's a wild variance in quality of garlic bread.

41:52.420 --> 41:54.900
Yeah, you really don't know what you're gonna get.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.420
This is an important question, Griffin.

41:56.420 --> 41:58.500
In the Yahoo Answers question you just read,

41:58.500 --> 42:01.220
had this person begun eating the garlic bread

42:01.220 --> 42:02.500
or had the garlic bread,

42:02.500 --> 42:05.860
or were they just like anticipating the garlic bread?

42:05.860 --> 42:08.900
They were eating garlic bread.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.100
Okay. Okay.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.620
That was important because I was gonna say

42:11.620 --> 42:13.460
that this is an unfortunate experience

42:13.460 --> 42:17.380
if you feel this every time you anticipate garlic bread

42:17.380 --> 42:18.580
and then you eat it and you're like,

42:18.580 --> 42:20.420
whoa, that didn't deserve that.

42:21.140 --> 42:23.380
There's a lot of unfortunate things about this, Travis.

42:23.380 --> 42:25.700
Namely like you can never go to Olive Garden.

42:25.700 --> 42:28.420
Well, you can go to Olive Garden once.

42:30.740 --> 42:32.500
You better plan your day though.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.340
You better have a whole exit strategy.

42:34.340 --> 42:38.260
Maybe do it on a birthday or something before you're 18.

42:38.260 --> 42:39.780
But do it on a birthday

42:39.780 --> 42:42.340
and just have it be like a really nice special day

42:42.340 --> 42:44.180
and you're just like, no, going in.

42:44.180 --> 42:46.260
This is the first and only time

42:46.260 --> 42:49.060
I'll ever be allowed inside of an Olive Garden.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.140
You'll know if you find someone with this condition

42:51.140 --> 42:52.740
if you're an Olive Garden waiter

42:52.740 --> 42:53.780
because when you ask them what they want,

42:53.780 --> 42:56.740
they're the ones who stare off into the distance for 10 minutes.

42:56.740 --> 42:57.860
Like, oh, what a question.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.420
What does one get?

43:00.420 --> 43:06.980
What does one get at their one visit to the Olive Garden?

43:08.260 --> 43:10.260
Oh, what a question.

43:10.260 --> 43:11.380
Any special-

43:11.380 --> 43:12.900
How is the spaghetti?

43:14.020 --> 43:17.460
Could I have the garlic bread and a garlic bread sandwich

43:17.460 --> 43:19.700
and garlic bread with spaghetti on top of it, please?

43:20.420 --> 43:21.780
And a privacy curtain.

43:22.820 --> 43:24.820
And maybe like a couple bibs.

43:25.460 --> 43:29.220
I would humbly request that rather than bringing the bread first,

43:29.220 --> 43:31.060
as is a common practice,

43:31.060 --> 43:35.060
I would ask that you bring my meal before the bread

43:35.060 --> 43:37.540
and perhaps the checks as well.

43:37.540 --> 43:39.460
And then clear a pathway for me.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.100
If you offer any Andy's Mints,

43:42.740 --> 43:46.580
I would request that you deliver those to my table

43:47.540 --> 43:50.100
before the bread portion of the meal.

43:50.100 --> 43:52.340
And no, I will not remove my mask.

43:52.340 --> 43:54.660
One more recommendation,

43:54.660 --> 43:57.060
just before you do bring that garlic bread,

43:57.060 --> 44:01.300
make sure to contact mall security ahead of time.

44:01.300 --> 44:02.980
I will go willingly,

44:02.980 --> 44:04.820
but I don't want a lot of fuss.

44:04.820 --> 44:06.980
Hey, this Kevin,

44:06.980 --> 44:08.820
this Kevin that's talking to you right now

44:08.820 --> 44:10.180
will go willingly.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.140
Garlic bread Kevin,

44:12.500 --> 44:13.620
no rules just right.

44:13.620 --> 44:14.420
Is that your thing?

44:15.220 --> 44:19.140
I just spit coffee in my face, you asshole.

44:22.020 --> 44:23.220
I got a whole situation here.

44:23.220 --> 44:27.540
For real though, garlic bread is really good.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.900
So good usually.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.260
Oh, I know the answer.

44:30.260 --> 44:31.540
Oh, and it might kill it.

44:31.540 --> 44:33.860
Listen, Yahoo answers question answer.

44:33.860 --> 44:35.620
Kobe, this might kill you,

44:35.620 --> 44:37.700
but it's the only way you're gonna get through this.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.020
You're gonna have to go through immersion therapy.

44:40.020 --> 44:40.580
Oh God.

44:40.580 --> 44:42.740
You're just gonna have to like spend a long

44:43.300 --> 44:47.300
like bank holiday weekend eating garlic bread nonstop.

44:48.180 --> 44:50.660
By the end you will be super dehydrated.

44:50.660 --> 44:54.100
Yeah, well, yeah, you gotta be in a bathtub the whole time.

44:54.100 --> 44:57.060
You could also learn how to make garlic bread yourself.

44:57.060 --> 44:58.180
You'll have an advantage there

44:58.180 --> 45:00.500
because you'll always be the first one to know it's done.

45:01.460 --> 45:02.500
That's a good point, yeah.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.300
That's a good bake.

45:03.300 --> 45:04.980
Wait, hey, is it done yet?

45:04.980 --> 45:05.860
Nope, not yet.

45:05.860 --> 45:06.580
I'll tell you.

45:06.580 --> 45:10.420
Welcome to the weirdest episode of Great British Bake Off ever.

45:10.420 --> 45:12.500
Oh man, don't even let him in that tent.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.380
That's a bad bake.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.500
Don't eat that, Mary.

45:16.500 --> 45:18.420
Mary, no, God, Mary.

45:18.420 --> 45:22.740
Mary, Mary.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.260
You simply cannot.

45:24.260 --> 45:25.700
That's got a soggy bottom.

45:25.700 --> 45:28.260
A soggy bottom, it's a bad bake.

45:28.260 --> 45:29.780
Soggy front, more like.

45:29.780 --> 45:32.260
Twice a month, my family has a game night.

45:32.260 --> 45:33.300
We usually play Uno.

45:34.020 --> 45:36.660
Recently, my cousin who's nine started playing with us.

45:36.660 --> 45:38.980
When he plays, he's always sitting next to me.

45:38.980 --> 45:40.180
Every time his turn comes around,

45:40.180 --> 45:44.340
he plays his draw twos, draw fours, skips, and reverses on me.

45:44.340 --> 45:46.100
And I never get a chance to play

45:46.100 --> 45:48.500
and always end up in last place because of his bullshit.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.620
At what age is it appropriate for me to tell him

46:01.620 --> 46:03.780
to stop being a fucking asshole?

46:03.780 --> 46:08.660
That's from last place with 479 points.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.380
This is so unbelievably good.

46:11.380 --> 46:16.420
His fucking bite-sized Moriarty is ready for you at every turn.

46:16.420 --> 46:19.780
He's always ready to thwart whatever plans you've cooked up.

46:19.780 --> 46:23.300
Have a nice combo all lined up and he's well, well, well, well.

46:23.300 --> 46:24.020
Draw four.

46:24.020 --> 46:26.420
Hey, Steven, do you remember when I was seven

46:26.420 --> 46:29.700
and at my seventh birthday, you took the corner piece of cake?

46:29.700 --> 46:30.660
Draw four, motherfucker.

46:30.660 --> 46:31.540
Draw four.

46:32.740 --> 46:34.660
I've been planning this shit for two,

46:34.660 --> 46:37.220
honing my Uno skills for this moment.

46:39.300 --> 46:39.860
Here's the thing.

46:39.860 --> 46:44.660
If this interloper, this little nine-year-old devil fish,

46:44.660 --> 46:50.100
is the first one to put the screws to you like this while playing Uno,

46:50.100 --> 46:54.500
you and your family actually haven't been playing Uno up to this point.

46:54.500 --> 46:55.060
That's true.

46:55.060 --> 47:01.140
Because Uno is a savage game about hurting your opponents without reservation.

47:01.140 --> 47:03.380
It's why it's called Uno, because by the end of it,

47:03.380 --> 47:06.020
you'll feel alone and unsafe in the world,

47:06.020 --> 47:08.020
and like you're the only one you can trust.

47:08.020 --> 47:12.180
Yeah, it's actually pronounced you know,

47:12.740 --> 47:16.100
because now it's just like your little nine-year-old

47:16.100 --> 47:18.420
just fucked you over on the battlefield and he's like,

47:18.420 --> 47:19.220
and now you know.

47:20.820 --> 47:21.700
Now you've had a taste.

47:21.700 --> 47:23.220
Now you know what Toby can do.

47:24.580 --> 47:27.300
That's sort of like, that's about as good a pick as

47:27.300 --> 47:30.900
when I was at the beach with my in-laws and several cousins and uncles.

47:31.540 --> 47:34.260
I thought it'd be fun if everybody played some werewolf.

47:34.260 --> 47:35.060
Oh, boy.

47:35.060 --> 47:38.980
And just flash forward to an hour, just a pure hour

47:38.980 --> 47:41.540
of everyone at the table calling everyone else a liar.

47:41.540 --> 47:44.980
Just like constantly everyone accusing everyone of lying for an hour.

47:44.980 --> 47:48.660
There's a lot of really good vibes after that sesh.

47:48.660 --> 47:50.740
And then you went to Joe's Crab Shack.

47:50.740 --> 47:52.660
Then we went to Joe's Crab Shack.

47:52.660 --> 47:54.500
Do we want to talk about the Margaritaville,

47:55.860 --> 47:58.580
the harrowing Margaritaville voyage that you tried to go on?

48:00.100 --> 48:04.260
Okay, so I'm at the beach living the beach lifestyle like Island Boy do.

48:04.260 --> 48:05.860
You know how he does it.

48:05.860 --> 48:07.460
And we head over to Broadway on the beach,

48:08.260 --> 48:12.740
which is in Myrtle Beach, which was about a half hour from Paulie's Island.

48:12.740 --> 48:14.900
Oh, Jesus, you had to drive a half hour on this?

48:15.700 --> 48:18.020
And it was 40 minutes of the traffic, my dude.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.820
So we drive 40 minutes over there.

48:20.820 --> 48:25.380
And first off, we parked at the opposite end of the place from the Margaritaville.

48:25.380 --> 48:27.300
So I'm like, oh, fuck, can I get a good walk?

48:27.300 --> 48:30.420
Gonna be all sweaty for Jim when I show up.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.780
That's embarrassing.

48:31.780 --> 48:38.900
On the drive over, my father-in-law, Tommy, low country Tom, tells me that if I,

48:39.700 --> 48:45.060
the last time he was at Margaritaville, fucking he rolled up and the place was packed.

48:45.060 --> 48:46.180
Who's there playing a set?

48:46.740 --> 48:48.260
Why, it's James Buffett.

48:48.260 --> 48:50.820
I would fucking dissolve.

48:50.820 --> 48:53.860
My anticipation is already like off the charts.

48:53.860 --> 48:55.940
It's like I've been eating garlic bread all day.

48:55.940 --> 48:56.660
I'm out of control here.

48:56.660 --> 48:57.700
Just flooded.

48:57.700 --> 48:59.460
Just that basement is flooded.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.580
Just drenched.

49:00.580 --> 49:04.580
Now, have you been to a Margaritaville before, Justin?

49:04.580 --> 49:06.260
Was this your first experience?

49:06.260 --> 49:08.500
Yeah, but it was before I went through the change of life.

49:08.500 --> 49:08.900
Oh, I see.

49:08.900 --> 49:11.300
Which means becoming a dad and getting really into Jimmy Buffett.

49:11.300 --> 49:17.140
So we walk through this place and it's sort of like if Jersey Shore,

49:18.820 --> 49:22.900
it's not Jersey Shore, the TV show, but it's got that like boardwalk vibe,

49:24.020 --> 49:30.020
but it's in the sweltering miserable 95 degree heat of South Carolina.

49:30.020 --> 49:32.100
And we're strolling along.

49:32.100 --> 49:35.300
I have to walk past a closed down Magic Quest,

49:35.300 --> 49:38.900
which is like the saddest, I know, fucking brutal.

49:38.900 --> 49:42.900
I walked past a magic shop that I didn't have time to go into

49:42.900 --> 49:47.140
because I was so hungry for some of that coconut shrimp prepared by JB himself.

49:47.140 --> 49:50.340
Had the magic shop absorbed all the magic for Magic Quest?

49:50.340 --> 49:50.900
And that's why it closed.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.420
You know, they thought it was a heyday.

49:52.420 --> 49:55.380
They were like, well, listen, there's a lot of wands over there.

49:55.380 --> 49:57.620
Let's go get our fill, pick it clean.

49:57.620 --> 49:58.020
They looted it.

49:58.020 --> 50:00.100
Like the vultures we are.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.580
So we get to Margaritaville.

50:03.220 --> 50:07.540
It is 5.30 somewhere.

50:07.540 --> 50:08.660
I'm going to say the afternoon.

50:08.660 --> 50:14.500
It is 5.30 somewhere and it's 5.30 there as well.

50:14.500 --> 50:18.100
So I should have anticipated that five o'clock is the worst time

50:18.100 --> 50:20.180
to go to Margaritaville, obviously.

50:20.180 --> 50:22.100
But we show up at 5.30.

50:22.100 --> 50:24.740
My daughter is like basically like dehydrated.

50:24.740 --> 50:28.580
She's just a husk that I'm like dragging behind me on a leash.

50:28.580 --> 50:30.340
And we're like dead basically.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.780
We're like on the verge of death.

50:31.780 --> 50:34.660
And I show up and I'm just I'm looking around like peeking around

50:34.660 --> 50:37.140
like I know JB's probably expecting me

50:37.140 --> 50:39.860
because he heard I am boys on his way over.

50:39.860 --> 50:42.580
I get in there and they tell us to see our party.

50:42.580 --> 50:44.260
We are going to have to wait.

50:44.260 --> 50:45.540
This is not an exaggeration.

50:46.660 --> 50:47.700
Two hours.

50:47.700 --> 50:48.020
Whoa.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.340
How many were in your party?

50:51.460 --> 50:53.220
Thirty thirty six.

50:53.220 --> 50:56.340
Thirty six no seven people and a baby.

50:56.340 --> 50:57.300
There's a people too.

50:57.300 --> 50:59.860
But like you got to specify that for a high trimmer.

50:59.860 --> 51:00.340
Well, OK.

51:00.340 --> 51:03.460
You explained the wait actually earlier in the story

51:03.460 --> 51:06.340
and that is that Jim James Buffett the third

51:06.340 --> 51:08.820
is making all the coconut shrimp himself.

51:08.820 --> 51:11.780
It is the only thing on the menu which is kind of weird.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.420
Like he doesn't know how to make margaritas

51:14.420 --> 51:16.420
which is like he's obviously very successful.

51:16.420 --> 51:17.860
He has people who do that for him.

51:17.860 --> 51:19.540
But he can make a mean fucking coconut shrimp.

51:19.540 --> 51:22.340
So you mainly just come in and you get the shrimp.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.460
No questions asked.

51:24.420 --> 51:26.180
But it does take him a while to prepare them.

51:27.380 --> 51:29.860
So two hours.

51:30.420 --> 51:31.700
Two hours of waiting.

51:32.420 --> 51:33.380
Two hours.

51:33.380 --> 51:34.100
No way.

51:34.100 --> 51:35.700
Absolutely cannot do it.

51:35.700 --> 51:38.820
And what's that like lurking over my shoulder behind me?

51:38.820 --> 51:39.620
You guessed it.

51:40.340 --> 51:43.140
Fucking Joe's Crab Shack.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.420
The second choice.

51:44.420 --> 51:45.780
Like we're always second choice.

51:45.780 --> 51:47.380
America's second choice.

51:47.380 --> 51:47.940
Yeah.

51:47.940 --> 51:48.980
America's second choice.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.660
And like I would have had to walk like

51:50.660 --> 51:52.580
if we didn't want to eat Joe's Crab Shack

51:52.580 --> 51:55.060
we would have had to walk all the way the fuck back up here

51:55.060 --> 51:57.540
to eat it like the Japanese hibachi place

51:57.540 --> 51:59.940
at the Myrtle Beach Broadway on the beach.

51:59.940 --> 52:01.220
Like no not happening.

52:01.220 --> 52:02.340
It's got to be Joe's Crab Shack.

52:02.340 --> 52:02.980
We would have died.

52:02.980 --> 52:03.940
We wouldn't have lived.

52:03.940 --> 52:05.060
I get in there.

52:05.060 --> 52:08.260
They're playing matchbox 20s.

52:09.380 --> 52:10.740
Not one of the good ones.

52:10.740 --> 52:11.700
Like my favorite.

52:12.420 --> 52:14.340
No actually my favorite one.

52:14.340 --> 52:16.580
And I'm like whoa this is pretty okay.

52:16.580 --> 52:17.540
I sit down.

52:17.540 --> 52:19.460
I order a crab pot.

52:19.460 --> 52:20.660
They put a bib on me.

52:20.660 --> 52:21.220
Oh man.

52:21.220 --> 52:23.060
Doesn't it say something like this guy's a queef?

52:25.300 --> 52:27.380
It wasn't Dick's Last Resort girl.

52:27.380 --> 52:29.860
Oh sorry I got confused.

52:29.860 --> 52:31.940
They put one on me that says shrimp it ain't easy.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.220
Okay so they do write on them.

52:34.020 --> 52:35.060
They did write on them.

52:35.060 --> 52:37.060
It didn't say this guy's a real queef.

52:37.060 --> 52:39.540
I didn't realize that I'm the only one at the table

52:39.540 --> 52:46.340
that ordered a dish that necessitated in a bib.

52:46.340 --> 52:48.900
And I'm also the only one at the table

52:48.900 --> 52:52.180
who is not living a life in which physical fitness

52:52.180 --> 52:53.300
is a large component.

52:53.300 --> 52:53.780
Oh no.

52:53.780 --> 52:55.620
To put it in a ginger way.

52:55.620 --> 53:00.740
So this like it literally looks like they have.

53:00.740 --> 53:02.740
I don't know a nice way of saying this.

53:03.860 --> 53:06.740
I'm shaming myself here but I'm the only fat one

53:06.740 --> 53:08.580
and I have a bib and claw crackers

53:08.580 --> 53:10.740
that they brought special for me.

53:10.740 --> 53:14.820
Literally 20 minutes before I did not need to be living

53:14.820 --> 53:18.500
this life for 20 minutes before the food arrived.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.300
They addressed it like very early on in the meal.

53:21.300 --> 53:26.420
I was drinking a huge glass of blue drink

53:26.420 --> 53:30.100
that had a shark filled with a red drink

53:30.100 --> 53:32.820
that I poured into it called a shark bite.

53:32.820 --> 53:35.540
There was a limit to on those on the menu it said.

53:35.540 --> 53:39.620
Wait was the vessel the shark vessel full of red liquid

53:39.620 --> 53:41.060
was it a glass shark?

53:41.060 --> 53:44.180
No sadly it was a rubber shark that I did.

53:44.180 --> 53:46.500
My uncle Michael did steal it though so that.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.740
Damn Mike you can't leave me anything.

53:48.740 --> 53:51.060
On this the worst day of Justin's life.

53:51.060 --> 53:52.580
You couldn't leave him anything.

53:52.580 --> 53:54.100
No he stole it for John.

53:54.100 --> 53:58.500
He didn't just steal it from us.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.220
So just when I think.

54:01.220 --> 54:02.260
You should change his name

54:02.260 --> 54:03.860
in case they're looking for him Justin.

54:03.860 --> 54:06.660
Just when I think this could not get any darker.

54:07.860 --> 54:09.940
JB has abandoned me just to recap.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.140
JB has abandoned me.

54:11.140 --> 54:13.700
I'm wearing a bib that says shrimp and easy.

54:13.700 --> 54:14.820
And I'm the only one there.

54:14.820 --> 54:16.020
I want it.

54:16.020 --> 54:18.340
Another facet.

54:18.340 --> 54:21.700
There is a guy making with a balloon hat

54:21.700 --> 54:24.340
making balloon animals table to table.

54:24.340 --> 54:26.500
And I can just see from his orbit

54:26.500 --> 54:29.940
that he's like about to collide with Planet J man.

54:29.940 --> 54:32.660
And I'm like this cannot get any fucking worse.

54:32.660 --> 54:36.740
And then over the radio Tracy Chapman's fast car

54:37.300 --> 54:39.620
comes on in the Joe's Crab Shack.

54:39.620 --> 54:41.620
I love this fucking song.

54:41.620 --> 54:43.620
I do not want that.

54:43.620 --> 54:48.340
And like jalapeno slammers to be in the same zip code.

54:48.340 --> 54:51.380
It is uncalled for that I should be subjected

54:51.380 --> 54:55.460
to Tracy Chapman's beautiful dirge of pining and longing

54:55.460 --> 54:57.940
for a better life that she'll never arrive

54:57.940 --> 55:00.900
than why I'm sloppily eating caging crab legs

55:00.900 --> 55:02.260
out of a bucket with a bib

55:02.260 --> 55:04.340
while a balloon dipshit hovers

55:04.340 --> 55:06.260
and waits for his moment to pounce.

55:06.260 --> 55:07.940
It was the worst day of my life

55:07.940 --> 55:09.300
but the desserts were okay.

55:10.820 --> 55:12.260
Three out of five stars.

55:12.260 --> 55:15.700
And a s'mores thing and this concludes my Yelp review.

55:17.220 --> 55:20.900
And then we went to the Gilligan's Island Goofy Golf.

55:20.900 --> 55:24.260
The only Yelp review said that every time this guy goes

55:24.260 --> 55:26.660
there's someone pleasuring themselves on the sixth hole.

55:28.180 --> 55:30.260
And he said that's a must.

55:30.260 --> 55:31.860
What was the sixth hole?

55:32.820 --> 55:33.620
It was nothing.

55:33.620 --> 55:34.820
There was nothing there.

55:34.820 --> 55:37.060
There was no one pleasuring themselves.

55:37.060 --> 55:39.620
But there wasn't a particularly sexy bunker?

55:40.180 --> 55:40.980
No, but it did.

55:40.980 --> 55:43.140
I mean, it made sense there was a shack

55:43.140 --> 55:44.260
that said garlic bread

55:44.260 --> 55:46.500
except the sign had been like painted over.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.580
So obviously it was no longer available.

55:48.580 --> 55:48.980
Yeah.

55:48.980 --> 55:50.340
Which maybe explains that.

55:50.340 --> 55:55.620
But yeah, so that was basically the hardest day of my life.

55:55.620 --> 55:57.300
And I blame Jimmy Buffett for it.

55:57.300 --> 55:59.140
Why isn't the media covering this?

55:59.140 --> 55:59.540
Is what I wanna know.

55:59.540 --> 56:00.580
Where is the media?

56:01.140 --> 56:02.020
That's what I wanna know.

56:02.020 --> 56:04.260
Give Lockdia break for a second.

56:04.260 --> 56:05.300
He'll be there.

56:05.300 --> 56:06.580
Okay, he's not gonna swim away.

56:07.140 --> 56:09.140
Trust, he's gonna keep on fucking up.

56:09.140 --> 56:11.620
So just like wait till tomorrow.

56:11.620 --> 56:13.380
Just come give me a day in the light.

56:13.380 --> 56:14.660
Give me a day in the light.

56:15.220 --> 56:16.660
Just my day at court.

56:17.300 --> 56:18.420
That island court.

56:18.420 --> 56:20.900
You wouldn't sue James, would you?

56:20.900 --> 56:21.380
Who would you sue?

56:21.380 --> 56:24.980
No, I just want a small, I mean-

56:24.980 --> 56:25.540
Give me a list.

56:25.540 --> 56:27.380
Give me a Kill Bill top five list

56:27.380 --> 56:29.620
of people who wronged you in this story.

56:29.620 --> 56:30.660
Starting with number five

56:30.660 --> 56:32.660
until we get up to the main offender.

56:33.300 --> 56:35.940
Okay, number five, myself.

56:35.940 --> 56:37.620
I did agree to go

56:37.620 --> 56:39.140
and I knew that it was in Myrtle Beach.

56:40.260 --> 56:42.180
That's not really one of island boys hangouts.

56:42.180 --> 56:44.180
That kind of violates this whole chill lifestyle.

56:44.180 --> 56:44.820
Yeah, absolutely.

56:45.860 --> 56:49.780
I blame the server for not recognizing me.

56:49.780 --> 56:53.700
Like the greeter at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville,

56:53.700 --> 56:56.740
I blame him for not recognizing me from podcasting.

56:56.740 --> 56:58.660
Yeah, how many times did you say the phrase,

56:58.660 --> 56:59.780
don't you know who I am?

57:01.460 --> 57:04.100
Just the once, but I thought that would be enough.

57:04.100 --> 57:08.100
I said, I'm about to shoot a streaming TV show, sir.

57:08.660 --> 57:10.180
That didn't fly.

57:10.180 --> 57:13.860
And I've made many jokes about my fan hood of James Buffett.

57:14.900 --> 57:19.060
Yeah, can you call, so number three, James,

57:19.060 --> 57:20.820
but I can't really blame him.

57:20.820 --> 57:22.180
He can't be everywhere at once

57:22.180 --> 57:24.100
and the server, despite my request,

57:24.100 --> 57:26.260
the greeter would not call him

57:26.980 --> 57:29.380
on like the coconut telegraph

57:29.380 --> 57:33.300
or whatever they use to communicate with Jimmy.

57:33.300 --> 57:36.580
So that would be your kill Bill interaction there

57:36.580 --> 57:38.420
where you actually were interacting with Bill

57:38.420 --> 57:39.460
and you didn't want to do it,

57:39.460 --> 57:41.860
but you knew you had to to give your life

57:41.860 --> 57:43.380
some kind of like closure.

57:44.180 --> 57:46.660
Right, did you know if you cut a coconut open

57:46.660 --> 57:49.860
and you whisper into it, he'll hear it.

57:50.980 --> 57:53.540
But he might not always answer the way you think.

57:53.540 --> 57:57.380
Yeah, you gotta look out for signs.

57:57.380 --> 57:58.740
You're not gonna get the answer you want,

57:58.740 --> 58:00.420
but you're always gonna get the answer you need.

58:01.060 --> 58:02.100
Thanks, James.

58:02.100 --> 58:04.260
Number two, number one, just real quick.

58:04.260 --> 58:06.660
God, obviously.

58:08.900 --> 58:11.380
I feel like Tracy Chapman had a hand in this somehow.

58:11.380 --> 58:13.380
Tracy Chapman did, maybe we swap

58:13.380 --> 58:14.980
Tracy Chapman number two

58:14.980 --> 58:17.700
for just being such a talented,

58:17.700 --> 58:19.300
heartbreakingly good songwriter.

58:19.300 --> 58:19.800
Yeah.

58:20.580 --> 58:25.780
Rob Thomas 2A for dropping the ball with Matchbox 20,

58:25.780 --> 58:27.220
just like letting that whole shit,

58:27.220 --> 58:28.580
maybe we're all to blame for Matchbox 20

58:28.580 --> 58:29.780
not being the prominent force in media.

58:29.780 --> 58:31.060
Yeah, why didn't we appreciate them

58:31.060 --> 58:32.100
as much as we should have?

58:32.100 --> 58:34.260
Everyone else, that's not me.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.420
Every review you read of their albums is just like,

58:36.420 --> 58:39.620
I wish it was, why isn't it Matchbox 30 or 40?

58:39.620 --> 58:41.460
And it's like, can you focus on the fucking music

58:41.460 --> 58:43.220
instead of talking about how the number could be higher?

58:44.260 --> 58:46.260
We're smooth too, the sequel to Smooth,

58:46.260 --> 58:46.980
we're all waiting.

58:48.180 --> 58:50.580
And God, number one, and I guess Yelp

58:50.580 --> 58:52.420
for not telling me that there would be a review.

58:52.420 --> 58:53.300
I blame a lot of people.

58:53.300 --> 58:53.800
Yeah.

58:54.340 --> 58:55.780
Do you guys feel like Matchbox 20

58:55.780 --> 58:56.820
is like getting some heat again?

58:56.820 --> 58:57.780
It's getting some heat again.

58:57.780 --> 59:00.180
A lot of people are talking about Smooth.

59:00.180 --> 59:01.460
A lot of people talk about Smooth

59:01.460 --> 59:03.620
and I feel like we've rounded the bin.

59:03.620 --> 59:05.940
Like, remember when Dwight started listening

59:05.940 --> 59:07.060
to Billy Joel as a joke

59:07.060 --> 59:08.660
and then he got really into Billy Joel,

59:08.660 --> 59:10.500
I feel like we're all making that Billy Joel switch

59:11.300 --> 59:12.260
with Matchbox 20.

59:12.260 --> 59:13.540
We're kind of appreciating that like,

59:13.540 --> 59:15.220
they did have some pretty fucking good songs

59:15.220 --> 59:17.460
and they didn't make a lot of sense, like lyrically,

59:17.460 --> 59:19.300
but there are still some pretty good tunes.

59:19.300 --> 59:22.580
I've been on board with MV20 since day one.

59:23.700 --> 59:26.260
I found them, here's a little,

59:26.260 --> 59:27.620
this might be controversial,

59:27.620 --> 59:30.260
but as much as I love Dave Matthews Band,

59:30.260 --> 59:34.420
I found Matchbox 20 to be a solid,

59:34.420 --> 59:37.140
if not better, Dave Matthews Band alternative.

59:38.180 --> 59:41.700
Like someone who maybe is lactose intolerant

59:41.700 --> 59:43.620
and they only drink almond milk.

59:43.620 --> 59:46.580
Matchbox 20 is the almond milk of music.

59:46.580 --> 59:49.860
Do you know who was in Cincinnati last night,

59:49.860 --> 59:52.900
just a scant month before Travis is to make his home there?

59:53.540 --> 59:55.780
Why, it's Rob Thomas and Counting Crows.

59:55.780 --> 59:58.500
I would have destroyed that show.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.340
Shit, that's a good lineup.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.540
It's a good lineup.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.900
I would have crushed that show.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.420
What if those two forces get together

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.580
and they start a band called Matchbox 30

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.420
and the OG crew of Matchbox 20 is like,

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.260
yo Rob, yo Bobby, yo Bobby Tom, what's going on?

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.580
You can't just do that to me and us,

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.260
the rest of the band Matchbox 20.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.980
And Rob Thomas is like,

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.580
I don't even know you guys anymore,

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.460
but that's true because he's in a fugue state

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.020
where he can no longer remember Matchbox 20

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:30.980
and I'm worried about him.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.100
Did Carlos Santana cast a memory spell on him?

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.140
That's all I wanna know.

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.380
And for a while he was just a show creator

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.740
and he made Veronica Mars and they were like,

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.940
come back to music and he's like,

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:42.820
I don't know what you're talking about,

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.100
I've always been a show creator

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.740
because of a weird curse that Carlos Santana put on him.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.860
He played the forbidden riff.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.700
Super quick update from the Wikipedia page of Matchbox 20,

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.380
not reading any facts this time,

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.060
just wanna say they have that timeline

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.940
that shows when everybody was in the band and what have you,

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.340
and it extends to 2017,

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.180
which I feel like is maybe getting a little bit above.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.660
It's like the Mayan calendar of Wikipedia pages.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.020
Rob Thomas I think will probably go on there and say,

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.060
okay, yeah, yeah, probably, I mean, yes, yes, true.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.020
In February 2017, there's gonna be the great cataclysm,

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.940
but then Rob Thomas is gonna get back in the group

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.900
and be like, guys, time for the smooth sequel, Smooth 2.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.660
It's still a hot one.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.580
It's a hot- Like six inches on the midday sun.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.260
It's a hot one again.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.140
And you're still like the ocean.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.460
So this has been our podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.180
It's an advice show.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.500
I would like to know if it's still a hot one though.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.940
I mean, global warming's really just going buck wild

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.860
and I think it just like Rob Thomas has a sort of a responsibility.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.140
I did wanna tell everybody before we get into all the stuff

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.100
we gotta talk about real quick.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.540
I guess this is one of the stuffs.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:08.820
So Wednesday, September 7th, 7 p.m., Joseph Beth Booksellers.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.580
I am going in Cincinnati, Ohio.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.580
I'm going to be there moderating a discussion

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.260
with the co-creators and authors of Welcome to Night Vale,

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.740
Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor that should be really fun.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.780
I really love Night Vale

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.460
and it should promise us to be an illuminating discussion

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.300
despite my participation in it.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.420
I'll probably be there too,

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.980
but I'll just be like looking at books and drinking coffee

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.220
and just like hanging out in Joe Beth.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.180
I've missed Joe Beth.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:46.180
So there's more information on that at welcometonightvale.com.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.060
And anyway, that's 7 p.m., September 7th.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.940
If you're around that area in Cincinnati,

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.940
you should come on out

01:02:53.940 --> 01:03:00.020
because I think that it'll be really fun, personally, I think.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.780
Sure.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.180
For me.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.220
Yeah.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.220
And if you're in the LA, just another quick plug,

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.460
if you're in the LA area, September 22nd,

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:13.300
our friend Kate Leth is gonna be doing a similar gig with them.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.500
So it should be pretty cool.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.100
And if you're in the LA area right now,

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.780
just go to Travis's fucking place

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.300
and get you some patio furniture.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.180
I guarantee you're gonna love it.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.700
I'll give it to you for 25 bucks.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.780
You won't do it on the free skis, huh?

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.260
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.060
for the use of our theme song,

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.900
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.020
It's a great song, great album.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.900
I want to thank the Max Fun Network for having us.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.180
You can go to maximumfun.org

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.180
and just start listening to some good, good podcasts

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.300
like One Bad Mother, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade.

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:44.260
There's so many great ones that I guarantee you're gonna love.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.940
Just go to maximumfun.org and check it out.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.100
And we also have other podcasts that we do,

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.820
which you can find all of them at McElroyShows.com.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.060
And you can find all the video stuff we do there as well.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.500
It's full of all of our content.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:58.820
Catch it.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.660
I also just want to say that we're ramping up

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.620
into beginning production on our TV show.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.660
And just as a personal note, I'm super excited about it.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.700
Yeah, fuck yeah.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.300
I think you all are really gonna like it.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.820
We've been trying as we've been like talking about it

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.460
to think like what would our listeners like above all?

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.820
And I'm very excited about it.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:19.940
I can't wait to get started.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.660
Yeah, we're gonna, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.340
Anything else, boys?

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.380
You like follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.420
No, we're not gonna do that.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.540
All right, here we go with the final Yahoo.
