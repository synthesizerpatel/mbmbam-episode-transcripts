00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.760
The world is not responsible for fixing your life. Look at the person in the mirror. Oh,

00:49.760 --> 00:57.680
thank you. Thank you so much. Hi, welcome to my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.040
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.080
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:20.080 --> 01:27.680
Who here has never listened to My Brother, My Brother, Me before?

01:29.200 --> 01:32.960
How confused were you when Frankenstein had popped up on the screen?

01:35.520 --> 01:40.960
We just really like him. We think he's great. Welcome to your number one Frankenstein fancast.

01:41.840 --> 01:48.800
So welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. This is a kind of notable episode in terms of live shows

01:48.800 --> 01:58.480
we've ever done in our entire lives because we are sober. I want to step in here and say,

01:58.480 --> 02:03.600
I've done a lot of shows with diarrhea. There was no way I was drinking during those.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.560
Fair enough. Fair enough. This is par for the course for me.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.080
I, how has everybody's podcast, this is like, you know, fishing for applause,

02:16.080 --> 02:24.000
but how has PodCon treated you all? It's nearly the end of day one.

02:25.680 --> 02:31.920
I have just, I've had a great time. My mind is flooded with great new podcast ideas.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.400
There's definitely a sense of, I love meeting everybody, but I bet at least a few people in

02:36.400 --> 02:40.480
this room have had this thought, this has been so fun. I would actually at this point like to

02:40.480 --> 02:45.040
just go home and listen to some podcasts, please. I need a little bit of a break.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.120
I mean, wouldn't it be great that maybe that's something we could offer at PodCon 3 where like

02:49.120 --> 02:52.400
you're all sitting there watching, but also you're wearing headphones and just getting

02:52.400 --> 02:56.320
the audio feed through there and you're all in individual cubicles and don't have to see each

02:56.320 --> 03:04.160
other. That would be. That's the dream. I had an idea for a podcast. I wanted to bounce off

03:04.160 --> 03:09.040
you guys because I'm looking for collaborators. I'm shopping around. You're looking for funding.

03:09.040 --> 03:16.320
I'm looking for $1.5 million in startup funding. I had this idea for a podcast that was inspired

03:16.320 --> 03:21.360
from my experience of being here. And the podcast, I don't have a title or anything yet.

03:21.360 --> 03:28.640
It's still very early days. But it's about how to use a convention center bathroom like an adult.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.160
And that's not a judgment of the PodCon attendees. I would say you all are above average in that

03:36.160 --> 03:40.800
department. I've been to a lot of cons in my day. And there's just something about stepping foot

03:40.800 --> 03:45.680
into a convention center that makes a lot of people apparently feel like this is not my home.

03:46.320 --> 03:54.080
I can do whatever I want in here. It's universal. It's not just podcast. Marie Kondo could be doing

03:54.080 --> 03:58.640
like a manners convention and step into a convention center bathroom stall and be like,

03:58.640 --> 04:06.000
let's see what I can do in here. This is my canvas. This brings me joy.

04:09.520 --> 04:19.680
I like podcast. Probably Comic Con is the best for this because I love seeing beloved characters

04:19.680 --> 04:25.440
come out of the shitter. There's nothing better than I just saw Deadpool and he was pooping.

04:25.440 --> 04:31.200
Seeing a Spider-Man walk out of a bathroom stall and you're like, oh, sick costume. And you walk

04:31.200 --> 04:38.320
in there after them and you're like, great responsibility, dog. You've done irresponsible

04:38.320 --> 04:43.280
things in here, Spidey. More than that, I've also seen poor cosplay planning where I did

04:43.280 --> 04:51.040
once see a Spider-Man walk up to a urinal and go, oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. And then I just had to

04:51.040 --> 04:58.160
picture a fully naked Spider-Man. At that point, the mass becomes essential.

05:00.720 --> 05:06.800
No one can know. So anyway, we hope you're enjoying podcast convention too. We know we are.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.440
So let's get into the podcast proper. This is an advice show where we take your questions and

05:11.440 --> 05:15.600
turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. Later on in the program, we're going to be taking some

05:15.600 --> 05:22.400
questions from the audience. So please start cooking those up in your noggin. We're going to

05:22.400 --> 05:28.400
do some other stuff first, though. So let's get right into it. That sounded sinister.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.920
No, but this is wonderful because normally when you do this at home, people can't see

05:31.920 --> 05:34.960
that it's not that you don't have the questions pulled up. You just don't know what you're saying.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.120
So here we go.

05:39.120 --> 05:46.640
Here we go. I work for a grocery delivery service downtown, and one of our regular customers is

05:46.640 --> 05:56.240
Macklemore. He is always buying the best food in the store. Pizza, soda, chips.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.680
In large- Where is this store?

05:59.680 --> 06:02.880
Where is this person is what I want to know. The best stuff.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.640
What else does the store sell?

06:04.640 --> 06:10.160
Well, in large enough quantities that I know he has to be throwing some baller parties.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.720
I frequently shop this order for him and it always makes me hungry.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.280
How do I get him to invite me to these parties?

06:19.280 --> 06:27.360
Please, sir, may I have some Macklemore in Seattle? Question. Is Macklemore a Seattle person?

06:27.360 --> 06:35.760
Okay. Don't brag about it. Round of applause. How common is this? Have you all seen Macklemore

06:35.760 --> 06:42.400
around? Holy shit. That's like half of you. Are you here by the way? Question asker.

06:43.200 --> 06:48.160
All right. Awesome. Are you prepared for the reality that you get there? I'm like,

06:48.160 --> 06:52.000
he invites you in and it's just him eating eight bags of chips by himself.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.320
Oh, thank God. Please come in. I'm so lonely. I'm going to pop some bags.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.760
I've been waiting for someone to ask. I've been buying the best pizzas.

07:09.760 --> 07:14.080
I'm only getting name brand sodas. Come on. Hey, don't lie to me. Have they invented any

07:14.080 --> 07:18.480
new chips yet? You promise you can tell me, right? If they invent any new chips,

07:18.480 --> 07:23.520
Macklemore's got to be on the edge of chip fashion. Do you think he would take a bite and

07:23.520 --> 07:34.320
just be like, more like cracklemore? No, please don't leave. I need you to think through whether

07:34.320 --> 07:41.360
or not you really want Macklemore to invite you to his party. I know you think in theory you do,

07:41.360 --> 07:45.840
but if Macklemore's like, killer, see you at eight on Wednesday night after church.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.640
After youth group.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.840
After youth group. If you are standing outside his door at 755,

07:53.200 --> 07:58.000
there's not a moment where you're like, am I going to really go into Macklemore's house?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.560
Because you're not going to know anybody there.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.640
You're not going to know fucking anybody.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.920
Except Macklemore.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.920
Macklemore's going to be like, look, this is my grocery person. I'm crazy about them.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.040
They're cool.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.880
They're so cool, guys. Hold on a second.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.480
They always give me the best chips.

08:12.480 --> 08:16.720
Do you remember last time at the last party we had chips? They brought those.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.320
All of them.

08:18.320 --> 08:23.040
So let's take a moment to thank this grocery delivery person for the great chips.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.520
Thanks for the pizzas and sodas too. I don't want to let that get lost in the shuffle.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.520
Hey Macklemore, why did you buy pizza at the grocery store?

08:33.520 --> 08:34.960
If you're here, please.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.520
If only there was an easier way to have pizzas delivered.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.640
I know you're huge on thrift, but please, you don't have to resort to Tombstone, Macklemore.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.800
I don't think there's a person alive who is talking to somebody and they're like,

08:48.800 --> 08:51.120
how did you meet your best friend or significant other?

08:51.120 --> 08:54.880
And they'll be like, I met them at Macklemore's party that he had at his house.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.640
Didn't really know anybody there.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.840
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

08:57.840 --> 08:58.320
Yahoo.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.960
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merit Palmer. Thank you, Merit.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.160
It's Yahoo Answers user.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.960
Well, something's gone wrong.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.200
Someone called them.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.800
Bryce asks, can a PowerPoint be sexy?

09:17.920 --> 09:19.760
Like a sexual experience?

09:21.200 --> 09:26.240
So we're not talking about like the slides don't contain sexual material.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.120
Yeah, I think that would be a little too on the nose.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.480
This is more like the deliver the tone of voice, the pacing.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.760
The framing of it itself can be...

09:35.760 --> 09:41.040
You know, I think that when you see someone do something they're very good at,

09:41.040 --> 09:42.240
that can be intensely...

09:42.240 --> 09:43.360
Like if you see someone play...

09:43.360 --> 09:47.440
Were you about to say the words intensely sexual out loud?

09:47.440 --> 09:50.240
I was, I pulled the ripcord and I bailed out of it.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.320
Three quarters of the way.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.960
You stuffed the ripcord back in the hole like, no, no, no, get back in there.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.320
Please don't look at my parachute.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.200
And that's all I've got.

10:01.200 --> 10:01.520
Bye.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.000
Bye.

10:02.000 --> 10:02.960
That's my time.

10:02.960 --> 10:08.800
That was a challenging thought to float at a convention about a specific craft, Trav.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.280
Thank you.

10:10.080 --> 10:14.080
I guess what I'm saying is, you know, when you watch Hank and John make a podcast

10:14.080 --> 10:15.280
and you're like, damn.

10:15.280 --> 10:15.780
Yeah.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.960
It's the pacing is so important with a sexy PowerPoint.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.720
Because a lot of people just rush through them before they've completed their thought

10:26.720 --> 10:28.480
and you have to slow it down.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.800
One, hit every bullet.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.040
What I love is when I...

10:33.040 --> 10:34.800
Make me wait for it.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.840
When I'm just about to...

10:35.840 --> 10:40.400
Hold your hand up to the screen and act like you're going to click.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.720
It doesn't let your thumb caress the button.

10:44.240 --> 10:48.000
And then you're saying, moving on.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.200
Here we go.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.640
The next thought is coming up.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.520
Up, right.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.020
Now!

11:06.240 --> 11:07.520
And then you just cum.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.120
Come on!

11:09.120 --> 11:12.000
I mean, it was obviously fucking implied, but Jesus.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.560
Oh, okay.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:14.080 --> 11:14.960
Can we take it back?

11:14.960 --> 11:15.600
Edit that out.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.520
Of your brains.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.880
I mean, you got a laser pointer.

11:20.880 --> 11:27.280
You could ostensibly go real fast with it to make sort of a laser light show of some

11:27.280 --> 11:28.240
erotic shapes.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.520
And I won't be blue like my rude brother Travis.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.880
This rude boy.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.120
I guess I'm kind of the bad boy of the podcast.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.840
Last summer, this won't play in audio.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.320
No way.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.680
We sometimes distribute this.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.080
Last summer, I was working for a summer camp.

11:48.080 --> 11:52.560
And I told my mom that I needed a pair of khaki shorts.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.640
The official clothes of summer camp.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.640
If you're going to summer camp or catching Pokemon.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.720
So I got a pair of khaki shorts.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.280
She proceeded to buy me three pairs of them.

12:04.000 --> 12:04.720
This was fine.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.680
Until the next week when she bought me three more.

12:11.120 --> 12:16.000
This continued every week until I begged her to stop buying me khaki shorts.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.840
Begged.

12:17.840 --> 12:22.160
How do I keep this from happening to me again in the future?

12:22.160 --> 12:24.560
That's from covered in khakis.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.200
Are you here?

12:26.000 --> 12:26.400
Hello.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.360
I can see you.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.680
Hey, just how many shorts did that?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.520
What was the grand finale total?

12:31.520 --> 12:32.240
What did you net?

12:33.920 --> 12:37.120
No, that is not divisible by three.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.920
I'm sorry to math you like that.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.160
21 perhaps.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.160
Well, now we're all wondering what happened to that one pair.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.960
That's mom's cut.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.880
I don't feel like this is going to happen again.

12:55.920 --> 13:03.120
I would say first off, if your concern is you'll somehow fall into this khaki vortex once more.

13:03.120 --> 13:10.960
I do think that I would really appreciate the thrill of going about my life day to day.

13:10.960 --> 13:15.440
Eating whatever chilies I liked or melting ice creams and thinking,

13:15.440 --> 13:16.240
fuck these shorts.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.880
I actually don't care.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.840
Dribble on down all you want, Mr. Chocolate Sauce.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.480
I've got another pair of you at home.

13:24.480 --> 13:30.640
I also think it would be worth it for like just gifting the story to the Goodwill employee

13:30.640 --> 13:32.400
who like opened the bag and was like.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.640
The light shines out of it.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.120
There's like 30 pairs of khaki shorts in here.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.720
Is this person Doug funny?

13:38.720 --> 13:39.600
What the hell?

13:40.560 --> 13:41.600
Yeah, that's a good point.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.560
You could actually develop a uniform, which would be very cool.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.680
You could wear the same.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.760
You just need to tell them like, I love green sweater vests and white t-shirts.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.000
Also, I need them for camp.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.320
I think if you want to stop the flow, you need to find some way to start

13:56.320 --> 13:58.640
doing the shorts like drugs.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.920
I don't know what that looks like.

13:59.920 --> 14:06.720
There's probably some way of getting shorts inside of you that would goof you up somehow.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.240
I meant like smoking.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.160
God, you all are nasty.

14:10.160 --> 14:16.720
But the PodCon one crowd was not nearly this yucky and their bathroom usage was way better.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
I'm sorry to bring this back on you.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.680
I messed up.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.040
I flossed in front of my students.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.920
Now they won't, uh,

14:27.920 --> 14:31.600
Now they won't, uh, stop asking me to do it again.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.920
How did I regain power in my classroom?

14:37.520 --> 14:39.280
That's from Courtney in Vancouver.

14:39.280 --> 14:39.840
Are you here?

14:40.720 --> 14:42.080
It sounds like you have the power.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.880
Yeah, you're the most powerful person in that room for sure.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.480
You have something they want.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.000
As you say, do your homework and I shall floss.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.800
Yes, teacher.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.920
Or if you don't do your homework, I'm gonna floss.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.400
Is this how far gone we are that they have not seen people floss before?

14:58.400 --> 15:02.560
Like, is it like they've never, they never learned how?

15:02.560 --> 15:03.600
Is that fascinating?

15:04.160 --> 15:05.280
Wait a second, Justin?

15:10.240 --> 15:11.200
You know what I mean.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.280
So wait, hold on, audience, don't reward this.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.600
In your mind, this teacher, this wonderful PodCon guest just stood up one day and said,

15:21.600 --> 15:24.880
Hey, class, check it out.

15:24.880 --> 15:31.680
And they were like, whoa, how did you put it between your chompers?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.880
That's why I'm doing it again.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.640
These plaque riddled teens.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.800
That's why I thought it was so funny.

15:40.800 --> 15:52.160
Well, that's our last episode, everyone.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
That's how we knew we were so far out of touch.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.120
We weren't allowed on the internet anymore.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.680
This is the Fortnite, isn't it?

15:59.680 --> 16:00.640
Yeah, it's one of them.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.920
I do not know how to continue with this question,

16:07.920 --> 16:12.240
which is unfortunate because I felt like it had a lot of promise.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.480
I thought it was weird that they flossed in front of, okay.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.120
Okay.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.880
I did think it was weird that they flossed in front of students,

16:20.880 --> 16:28.080
but also I've been alive for 38 years and flosses meant one thing for like 37 of those.

16:28.080 --> 16:28.880
So fuck off.

16:28.880 --> 16:39.120
Wait, how did you turn so quickly to being on his side?

16:39.840 --> 16:42.960
We were all in this moment together 30 seconds ago.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.840
The good news is within like the next three months,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.480
I can pretty much guarantee you that floss is going to go back to

16:50.480 --> 16:52.560
only meaning that stuff you do with your teeth.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.480
The shelf life of these things is usually very limited.

16:56.480 --> 17:02.240
You made a prison for yourself and it's not our job to scoop you out of it.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.840
We're not going to give you the ball hammer Andy Dufresne.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.480
You goofed up pretty hard.

17:08.480 --> 17:13.120
You give a mouse a floss dance and the rest of the saying.

17:13.120 --> 17:22.480
I don't know what the only sort of member of the team up here I feel like.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.280
And I said something dirty like 30 minutes ago.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.320
A real dirty word so you all remember.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.320
Why do you want them to relish in it?

17:30.320 --> 17:31.680
God, what a weird episode.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.400
I want it.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.880
I know what it I know what it means.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.000
Do it in that.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.040
No, I'm not going to do it.

17:37.040 --> 17:37.360
No way.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.880
This is an audio medium.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.000
Not a million years.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.080
He's just scared.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.920
You're making the show worse because there's not a reality in which this will happen.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.720
It's an audio product and I'm not going to have.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.920
Oh, he's doing it.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.880
He's watching so good.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.280
The speed of his arms is lifting him off the ground.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.600
He's ascending into heaven.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.040
Goodbye, Justin.

18:01.040 --> 18:01.520
Goodbye.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.760
He took his mic with him.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.120
What's it like in heaven, Justin?

18:09.120 --> 18:13.040
I just Jesus told me that floss has meant something for 2000 years.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.960
And it wouldn't have occurred to him either, he says.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.400
I do have a Yahoo.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.040
Okay.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.400
This one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

18:24.400 --> 18:24.880
Thank you, Seth.

18:24.880 --> 18:34.480
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Jason with an M. Jason asks,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.960
what does the moon smell like?

18:39.920 --> 18:42.720
I've always been curious about what the moon smells like.

18:42.720 --> 18:47.760
And because there is no time that I will be on the moon and or able to smell the moon,

18:47.760 --> 18:50.320
it is a question I honestly wonder about.

18:50.320 --> 18:55.360
Also, I can't smell moon rocks that are on earth because their inherent moon smell would

18:55.360 --> 18:57.360
be compromised by earth smells.

18:58.000 --> 18:58.240
Yeah.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.160
Excellent point, Jason.

19:00.880 --> 19:06.640
I am saddened by Jason's question because of the line there will not be a time because

19:06.640 --> 19:10.560
what I realized is the question is that there will not be a time when I will be on the moon

19:10.560 --> 19:16.080
and or able to smell the moon, which does create a scenario in which Jason is on the

19:16.080 --> 19:20.800
moon but is unable to smell it because of that pesky glass and the helmet and he's

19:20.800 --> 19:26.240
just picking up handfuls of moon turquoise as he sucked back into space.

19:26.240 --> 19:26.480
Okay.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.360
I'm pretty sure it's the lack of atmosphere on the moon that would make it so you can't

19:31.360 --> 19:32.560
smell anything up there, right?

19:32.560 --> 19:34.720
Like even if you could, this is going to be another.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.720
If you nut in space, does it push you backward?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.480
I think everything got a smell.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.080
Everything got a smell.

19:44.080 --> 19:47.200
Water has a smell even if our noses can't pick it up so good sometimes.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.400
Everything got a smell.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.960
Even if you remove the atmosphere around it, if you take a stinky egg and you put it in

19:52.960 --> 19:55.920
a little vacuum tube and you suck all the air out, there may not be-

19:55.920 --> 19:57.840
It would fall at the same speed as a feather.

19:57.840 --> 19:58.400
Yes.

19:59.600 --> 20:05.040
There may not be the egg stink in there, but the egg still has a stink.

20:05.680 --> 20:06.160
Whoa.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.480
So you're saying that if it's dark, like if it's a dark part of the moon, you can like

20:12.480 --> 20:16.400
the rock still has a look, even though you can't see it?

20:16.400 --> 20:17.040
Whoa.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.280
We're sober, but are we stoned?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.120
Here's what I'm saying.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.080
Here's what I'm saying.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.480
I think that, okay, I'm pretty sure about this.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.920
You could never smell anything on the moon without compromising it with our terrible

20:29.920 --> 20:30.960
earth smells.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.520
Yes.

20:31.520 --> 20:36.000
If you brought a moon rock back in a vacuum from space-

20:36.000 --> 20:37.760
And you stuck your head in there real fast.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.080
I think you could have one, right?

20:40.080 --> 20:47.600
You'd have one chance where you could like get the good smell of it without the dirty

20:47.600 --> 20:48.240
earth air.

20:48.240 --> 20:48.960
This is interesting.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.800
Justin thinks it would be a very good smell.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.480
Well, but here's the problem.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.400
There would be no context because it literally smells like nothing on earth.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.680
So you would smell the moon and you'd be like, it smells like something.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.880
What would you compare it to?

21:00.880 --> 21:02.880
That's like seeing a new color for the first time.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.080
I want to smell the moon.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.600
But then think of the loneliness that you would have as being the only one who's ever

21:07.600 --> 21:08.560
smelled the moon.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.800
You could never discuss it with anyone.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.960
They would have to, now this is 2019.

21:12.960 --> 21:18.160
There would be like a bunch, they would bring back millions of rocks in tiny vacuum boxes

21:18.160 --> 21:20.480
and they would all be wrapped in like blind boxes.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.800
So you'd have to like have unwrapping videos and the people would smell them on YouTube

21:24.800 --> 21:26.080
is how it would probably go down.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.280
They wouldn't just bring back one moon rock in a vacuum box.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.200
Yeah, Justin-

21:31.200 --> 21:33.760
We've talked about this too seriously for too long.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.360
I'm just saying it's kind of a bummer that you can't smell the moon.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.360
What do you think the moon tastes like?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.960
No, I'm not going to do that.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.160
It's just rocks.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.040
But like the smell of-

21:43.040 --> 21:44.240
Like cheese?

21:44.240 --> 21:45.760
No, like the smell of the moon.

21:46.880 --> 21:47.440
If the moon-

21:47.440 --> 21:49.040
It smells like Neil Armstrong's feet.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.160
If the moon crashed into the earth.

21:52.160 --> 21:52.660
Okay.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.200
That would be bad.

21:55.200 --> 21:55.680
For sure.

21:57.120 --> 21:57.620
Okay.

22:00.880 --> 22:05.440
I'm a lifelong knitter and whenever I'm going somewhere where I know I will be waiting a

22:05.440 --> 22:09.200
lot like the airport or riding public transport, we know.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.160
I mean, thank you, but like we know places you wait.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.080
I like to take a small project and knit while I wait.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.600
The thing is on several occasions, I've looked up for my work at just the right moment to

22:19.600 --> 22:22.160
see what someone clearly trying to take a picture of me.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.480
More often than not, we lock eyes and they know that I know they're trying to take a

22:28.480 --> 22:29.040
picture of me.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.320
What do I do when I make eye contact with the person trying to stealthily take my picture?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.480
I didn't think knitting in public was that weird.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.520
The awkwardness kills me every time and that's from stitching in your Snapchat stories.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.400
Are you here?

22:43.840 --> 22:44.240
All right.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.320
And PS, I'm Jennifer Garner.

22:46.320 --> 22:46.820
Yeah.

22:47.760 --> 22:53.280
The great news is you already have two sharp objects in your hand.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.800
What the fuck are they doing?

22:56.800 --> 23:01.920
No matter how interesting or like unusual the thing you're doing is, it's like,

23:01.920 --> 23:05.680
gotta take a picture of this stranger is always weird.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.720
Even if you were flying and someone's like, well, they're not looking.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.800
Like that's a weird, it's uncomfortable.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.080
I'm gonna bet also that you are not the only person in this room that brought knitting

23:14.080 --> 23:14.720
with you today.

23:16.400 --> 23:16.960
All right.

23:16.960 --> 23:17.280
Yes.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.080
I see somebody.

23:18.080 --> 23:18.480
Yes.

23:19.200 --> 23:19.520
Yes.

23:20.720 --> 23:26.560
This is a sample size that is probably not representative, but still everybody's doing it.

23:26.560 --> 23:32.000
Maybe just everyone that you've seen try to take a picture is like me and has like,

23:32.000 --> 23:37.840
is just sitting there thinking like, this human being can focus on a project that long?

23:37.840 --> 23:38.560
Who is this?

23:38.560 --> 23:40.880
I need to remember them visually forever.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.280
In my phone.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.120
What were they gonna do with that fucking picture?

23:48.240 --> 23:50.480
Instagram, you'll never believe it.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.520
A scarf.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.880
Can you, I don't know how quickly you can knit,

23:54.880 --> 23:59.200
but can you super quick knit like, fuck you?

24:00.720 --> 24:02.720
Or like, no.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.080
Or like a net you can throw over them.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.200
Oh, that would be good.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.240
Give me the camera.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.480
And then you smash it on the ground and then you knit them a new camera.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.640
That's how it works.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.200
Yep.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.680
You knit a little cocoon that you wrap them up in.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.440
That would actually be very comfortable.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.120
That'd be a bad punishment.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.960
Knit me up a cocoon.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.080
That's just called a hammock.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.600
A fully enclosing apparatus?

24:31.600 --> 24:32.960
I've been doing hammock wrong.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.080
Yeah, I would say so.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.000
Hey, this is unconventional, but I have a riddle.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.600
We do a segment called riddle me piss.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.720
And you're not doing the voice.

24:48.720 --> 24:53.520
Riddle me piss, and Travis loves to take it over and do the voice and I hate the voice.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.960
I like to keep it very straight laced here on riddle me piss.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.640
Riddle me piss, boys.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.160
This is a riddle.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.920
Does it say, Travis, you know this website, does it say who did it?

25:08.640 --> 25:09.140
No.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.720
Someone did this riddle and they thought it was cool enough to share with the internet.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.560
Now I'm going to read it here in this room.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.000
Work it over in your own brain.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.200
I don't know why my voice just sounded like that.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.640
Do not shout the answer out.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.600
I'll be furious.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.100
Don't.

25:23.440 --> 25:28.320
A man with two heads walked down the street, but no one noticed or cared.

25:28.320 --> 25:28.820
Why?

25:30.800 --> 25:35.200
A man with two heads walked down the street, but no one noticed or cared.

25:35.200 --> 25:35.700
Why?

25:37.120 --> 25:38.160
Everyone was busy.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.760
Because in this cellular age, am I right?

25:41.760 --> 25:45.280
Hey, put your phones down and look at the dude with two heads.

25:47.600 --> 25:51.440
Is it the dirty reason?

25:54.480 --> 25:54.980
Okay.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.760
One head was in a bag.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.240
Zayfod Bibblebrox was filming a sequel to Cherry Head.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.320
You just wanted to say Zayfod Bibblebrox out loud.

26:06.320 --> 26:06.820
Yeah.

26:06.820 --> 26:07.320
Yeah.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.160
That's okay.

26:08.160 --> 26:08.880
What's the answer?

26:08.880 --> 26:12.000
The second head was the head of lettuce he was carrying.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.400
Still, someone should have noticed or cared.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.460
Lettuce.

26:17.460 --> 26:17.960
Nice.

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
Good for you, dog.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.000
Eating healthy.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.280
If you did see someone carrying a head of lettuce around, you would notice and care.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.080
I guarantee.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.120
This is from riddles.com, a website we like to visit from time to time.

26:29.120 --> 26:34.960
And I did not realize about this website there is a like dislike function, sort of similar to YouTube videos.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.000
I looked through a few of these.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.040
I looked through a lot of these.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.280
I looked through a few of these, I looked through a lot of these.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.480
There's not a single one with a positive ratio.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.360
That's my favorite thing.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.880
Because every time you'll see one, it's like 10 likes, 100 dislike.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.160
I'm like, ooh, gotta check this one out.

26:52.160 --> 26:52.880
Yeah, I gotta know.

26:52.880 --> 27:07.520
Oh, we didn't time our segments out very well.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.440
All the way out in Seattle, we've been found by a haunted doll watch.

27:14.960 --> 27:22.560
This doll is named Rhea, or rather Meshivius Rhea, haunted spirit doll, haunted doll child.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.560
Is the eBay listing.

27:24.560 --> 27:31.200
You can, it's currently bidding with no bids starting at 9.99.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.680
The evil number almost.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.400
The upside down evil number.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.360
Rhea is the spirit of a nine year old child.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.720
That's rough start.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.160
That's why it's 9.99.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.280
Very active energy and very demanding of attention.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.800
She communicates by spirit board and spirit box.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.640
She has broken English.

27:55.360 --> 27:59.360
Well, like that's for a ghost is good, though.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.760
If you think about it, that's pretty impressive.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.240
Like, why would you waste time with a bunch of words?

28:04.240 --> 28:06.080
You don't need just like get to the point.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.440
You're using someone's pointer to scoot across the board.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
There's not going to be a bunch of like apostrophes and stuff.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.360
It's ridiculous if my dog started talking and I was like, that's amazing.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.960
And I'd be like, it's not full sentences.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.760
Yeah, how did you, how did you die?

28:19.760 --> 28:21.440
Horse tragedy.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.280
What does that mean?

28:24.320 --> 28:25.680
Give me some pronouns in there.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.280
Her favorite thing to communicate are.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.240
Oh, now who's speaking with broke.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.280
Yeah, yeah.

28:33.280 --> 28:33.760
Right.

28:33.760 --> 28:37.040
Her favorite things to communicate are no mine.

28:37.040 --> 28:49.840
Get it pretty kitty.

28:52.240 --> 28:52.960
Apple time.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.640
Hey Ray, I'm going out on a date tonight.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.440
How do I look?

28:59.440 --> 29:02.800
Apple time speak sentences.

29:03.360 --> 29:03.840
Get it.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.800
What do you mean?

29:04.800 --> 29:05.520
Pretty kidding.

29:05.520 --> 29:10.400
No mine and various other simple things that she repeats.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.360
Does she speak in broken English or does she say four different things?

29:15.360 --> 29:18.160
Like a, like a peewee Herman doll, you're pulling the string on.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.680
She is known to be heard giggling, especially when your back is to her.

29:22.400 --> 29:22.960
Okay.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.440
Why would you ever turn your back on something haunted?

29:25.440 --> 29:26.160
But you're cool.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.920
That sentence construction would be way different.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.120
If you looked at her and she giggled, you could just write she giggles.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.280
I've seen it.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.760
I watched her face move.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.200
This one is real child.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.640
Because of her broken communication.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.600
She has been very hard to learn from about her past.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.920
She is very content as she is.

29:47.360 --> 29:47.680
Cool.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.000
That's like good for her.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.920
Why we're all trying to get there, right?

29:51.920 --> 29:55.600
I mean, it does beg the question, then why is she here?

29:56.320 --> 29:59.040
Cause it seems like if you're content, that's when you normally get.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.800
You know, that's an interesting thing that Justin has floated

30:02.800 --> 30:07.280
that if you walk into a there's not a toy store anymore, huh?

30:07.280 --> 30:12.560
Yeah, you walk into an American girl store and it's like, good.

30:12.560 --> 30:17.760
Everyone here is fulfilled their charge on earth and ascended into the afterlife.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.120
All of these empty husks.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.600
I just think, you know, maybe like she died and she got trapped in a doll

30:25.600 --> 30:28.240
and she was like, oh no, you know what?

30:28.240 --> 30:29.040
It's apple time.

30:29.040 --> 30:33.760
She easily adjusts to new places and people.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.320
If you don't mind bumps in the night and hearing giggling

30:36.320 --> 30:38.320
and the sounds of little feet running around.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.800
I do mind.

30:40.800 --> 30:41.760
You have a child.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.520
Yeah, I do.

30:44.240 --> 30:49.040
I have a child that we made together and is not a doll.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.400
But when you hear those feet in the night, you're not like, oh damn it.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.880
Actually, that's either my kid or a ghost.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.440
Right.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.160
I would be more scared if I heard feet running around in the middle of the night.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.960
And I did think it was my child who had woken up from slumber.

31:01.920 --> 31:06.000
She is best with other spirits and people who are understanding

31:06.000 --> 31:09.120
and know to expect anything from mischievous spirits.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.600
If you're a lover of spirits and treat them as family,

31:11.600 --> 31:14.320
if you're kind and understanding of their special needs

31:14.320 --> 31:19.040
and care required to own spirit items, then please consider Rhea.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.760
My spirit items come from a clean and non-smoking environment.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.800
I mean, it's important.

31:22.800 --> 31:23.360
Yeah.

31:23.360 --> 31:23.920
You do.

31:23.920 --> 31:24.880
You want to know that.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.560
You want to raise them right, you know?

31:26.560 --> 31:28.720
Well, this is my favorite part.

31:28.720 --> 31:33.280
She will arrive to you carefully and safely packed in a discreet manner.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.640
We'll just write on the box dildo box and no one will ever know.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.600
It would be pretty brutal to get like, just like wrapped in cellophane.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.520
Just like a doll is lying on your porch.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.640
Like, well, that tells, that's a short story that tells you everything

31:50.640 --> 31:52.080
you need to know about our new neighbors, honey.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.560
Well, time to move.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.840
I think I cracked the case.

31:55.840 --> 31:56.960
She'll arrive to you carefully.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.760
Please check back as I'm offering many of my spirit items all month.

32:01.760 --> 32:05.280
My items are well-known and loved across social media.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.240
Oh wait, who was this?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.320
Mysterious Rhea?

32:08.320 --> 32:09.920
Oh yeah, she's great.

32:11.440 --> 32:12.800
I know her on Tumblr.

32:14.480 --> 32:19.040
Previously, I was among the highest entrusted spirit item sellers on eBay

32:19.040 --> 32:21.760
until I took a break a few years back for family and self-care.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.400
I haven't.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.800
You sold a doll that killed someone.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.680
All right.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.960
You had the lay low.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.240
We get it.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.760
Anyway, that's your, for this week, your haunted doll watch.

32:46.880 --> 32:47.520
Don't do the thing.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.600
You always do the thing where you're like, oh, great job.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.440
But it's the only one, guys.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.640
It's the only one.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.360
Why don't I start with like, that's it?

32:55.360 --> 32:56.320
Maybe go negative.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.200
Yeah, neg us.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.560
Okay, okay, okay.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.280
All right, all right.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.080
We could tell they were trying, folks,

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
but these boys just couldn't bring it home.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.320
Bride in gears.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.760
Gotta get the long cane and grab them all by the necks.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.680
And who's that holding the cane?

33:11.680 --> 33:15.600
Well, it's Mike Myers and he's playing a new character on this game show.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.840
Comedy god, Dr. Kane.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.920
Dr. Herman Cain starring Mike Myers.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.720
So we have some advertisements that we'd like to tell you about.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.360
Thank you to PodCon, by the way, for coming out to PodCon.

33:26.960 --> 33:27.520
What?

33:27.520 --> 33:29.360
Our first sponsor is Blue Apron.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.480
Blue Apron is wonderful.

33:30.480 --> 33:34.880
Blue Apron makes these boxes and the boxes are full of food parts

33:35.840 --> 33:40.160
and special recipes specifically for those food parts that you follow

33:40.160 --> 33:44.400
to turn them into amazing dishes like sage and brown butter chicken

33:44.400 --> 33:47.600
with roasted vegetables and so many more.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.560
Did you know you can eat the box?

33:50.560 --> 33:53.440
Travis, they don't like it when you say that, I'm pretty sure.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.560
No, I mean, let me be clear.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.800
You're not supposed to, but you can.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.040
Yeah, and we're not gonna tell you that it tastes better than a regular old box.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.440
No, it's not seasoned.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.000
Let me be clear, the box is not seasoned.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.520
We won't not tell you that.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.840
So anyway, they got chef designed recipes that use fresh,

34:09.840 --> 34:13.200
seasonally inspired ingredients and time-saving tips and technique videos

34:13.200 --> 34:14.720
to help you learn how to be a better chef.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.680
It worked for me.

34:15.680 --> 34:16.640
I love cooking.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.680
I used to not and then this magical box came into my life.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.720
I climbed inside of it, traveled six years into the future

34:22.720 --> 34:25.280
and now here I am talking to you today.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.560
And I just ate it.

34:26.560 --> 34:27.840
So check out this menu.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.880
I need some gas money.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.840
I left my wallet back in 2013.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.160
Oh no, so check out this week's menu

34:34.160 --> 34:36.880
and get $60 off at blueapron.com slash my brother.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.800
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.440
And then it says here, Blue Apron, a better way to cook,

34:41.440 --> 34:44.240
parentheses, don't eat the box in parentheses.

34:44.240 --> 34:44.740
Yeah.

34:44.740 --> 34:46.180
I got this next one.

34:46.900 --> 34:47.400
Okay.

34:48.100 --> 34:48.820
Eat stamp?

34:52.020 --> 34:53.460
Stamp for not to eat.

34:53.460 --> 34:54.340
For mail.

34:55.780 --> 34:59.300
Stamps.com is a website that is just like a post office

35:00.660 --> 35:07.700
in that stamps are available but in every other way possible.

35:07.700 --> 35:10.980
It's like a post office in that Mark works there.

35:12.420 --> 35:14.420
There are Marks involved.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.100
But you won't feel like a Mark

35:16.100 --> 35:19.620
when you see these great prices and see how convenient,

35:19.620 --> 35:24.420
easy, reliable and efficient stamps.com is.

35:24.420 --> 35:27.460
You know, it is nice to be able to save yourself

35:27.460 --> 35:28.340
a trip to the post office,

35:28.340 --> 35:30.820
even if you have a delightful staff like I do,

35:30.820 --> 35:34.020
Frank and Tim and the whole game.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.460
I don't have a Mark.

35:35.460 --> 35:39.300
Stamps.com has all the power of the US Postal Service.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.060
And it's available-

35:41.060 --> 35:42.180
Who sweeps your driveway?

35:42.180 --> 35:43.620
It's available during the shutdown,

35:43.620 --> 35:45.860
which a lot of people didn't go to stamps.com

35:45.860 --> 35:47.620
because they thought it wouldn't be working.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.700
But it's right there and you can go for it.

35:49.700 --> 35:52.420
You can enjoy stamps.com with a special offer

35:52.420 --> 35:55.380
that includes a four-week trial plus postage

35:56.100 --> 35:58.500
and a digital scale.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.300
What?

35:59.300 --> 36:00.580
Start the new year off right.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.180
Go to stamps.com.

36:02.180 --> 36:04.420
Click on the microphone at the top of the home page

36:04.420 --> 36:05.860
and type in my brother.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.460
That's stamps.com.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.060
Enter my brother.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.140
I wish people wouldn't put enter my brother.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.500
Really need a different sort of way of saying.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.220
Just don't ever, please don't do that.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.060
Input my brother.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.100
Input my brother.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.380
Type my brother.

36:19.380 --> 36:23.540
Do you think that when the postman brings your digital stamp,

36:23.540 --> 36:26.820
he knows it's his way of saying goodbye?

36:26.820 --> 36:28.740
He just kind of hefts the box and he's like,

36:28.740 --> 36:31.940
hmm, that feels like Jesus.

36:31.940 --> 36:36.500
You wouldn't be trying to cut out the middle mark, would you?

36:38.260 --> 36:39.940
I'm doing my best over here.

36:39.940 --> 36:46.020
But anyway, stamps.com and then also at my brother.

36:46.020 --> 36:48.420
If you click on the microphone, type in my brother

36:48.420 --> 36:49.780
and press the return key.

36:49.780 --> 36:50.820
Mm-hmm.

36:50.820 --> 36:52.740
There, I avoided saying it again.

36:52.740 --> 36:56.740
Hi, I am Lori Kilmartin.

36:56.740 --> 36:57.780
And I'm Jackie Kish.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.260
Together, we host a podcast called

37:00.260 --> 37:01.780
The Jackie and Lori Show.

37:02.340 --> 37:03.780
We're both stand-up comics.

37:04.260 --> 37:06.500
We recently met each other because women

37:06.500 --> 37:08.980
weren't allowed to work together on the road

37:08.980 --> 37:10.820
or in gigs for a long, long time.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.940
And so our friendship has been unfolding on this podcast

37:13.940 --> 37:14.740
for a couple of years.

37:14.740 --> 37:16.500
Jackie constantly works the road.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.460
I write for Conan, and then I work the road in between.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.580
We do a lot of stand-up comedy, and so we celebrate stand-up.

37:22.580 --> 37:24.820
And we also bitch about it.

37:24.820 --> 37:25.940
We keep it to an hour.

37:25.940 --> 37:26.980
We don't have any guests.

37:26.980 --> 37:30.500
We somehow find enough to talk about every single week.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.220
So find us.

37:31.220 --> 37:33.060
You can subscribe to The Jackie and Lori Show

37:33.060 --> 37:36.500
at maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.060
OK, bye.

37:37.060 --> 37:42.020
That sounds like one to check out.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.300
If you would like a different podcast, though,

37:45.300 --> 37:47.620
we have half of one, a perfectly good,

37:48.180 --> 37:51.380
half of a podcast left here for you left on your plate.

37:51.380 --> 37:53.460
You know, there are kids in other countries

37:54.020 --> 37:57.540
that would love to eat half of a podcast.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.340
They got earphones with only one cup on them.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.980
Perfect for this half a podcast.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.460
We're going to do a couple questions here.

38:05.460 --> 38:08.980
I guess dead questions, the opposite of our live ones.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.580
Yeah, undead questions.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.380
Our show at PodCon ended up being kind of short,

38:13.380 --> 38:15.860
and we had some issues during the audience questions.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.340
And so we're going to try, instead of delivering you

38:18.340 --> 38:22.820
a 35-minute-long podcast, we're going to fill for time,

38:22.820 --> 38:25.380
as they say in TV business.

38:26.660 --> 38:27.860
Do we have a question, Justin?

38:28.500 --> 38:29.860
I got a question for you.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.940
I work for a very small company.

38:31.940 --> 38:34.740
My boss loves going on cruises.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.260
My husband and I are well-traveled,

38:36.260 --> 38:38.100
but when my boss learned we had never been on one,

38:38.100 --> 38:41.620
he gifted us a trip with himself and his wife

38:42.180 --> 38:46.580
on a cruise to the Bahamas as a Christmas bonus.

38:47.380 --> 38:51.060
Oh, man, it was a fine enough trip,

38:51.060 --> 38:54.340
but my husband and I decided we are not cruise people,

38:54.340 --> 38:55.700
and we would not like to repeat.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.580
Oh, you went?

38:57.940 --> 38:59.300
Dang, you went, huh?

38:59.940 --> 39:02.500
Okay, but my boss had so much fun,

39:02.500 --> 39:04.900
he keeps telling me that he can't wait for another

39:04.900 --> 39:06.340
annual winter trip with us.

39:06.340 --> 39:06.820
Oh, no.

39:06.820 --> 39:07.940
This fucking guy.

39:08.820 --> 39:09.940
This fucking guy.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.340
He already did the biggest, worst thing,

39:12.340 --> 39:14.980
and he's looking for a traditional repeat.

39:14.980 --> 39:15.480
Gross.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.900
Brothers, how do I kindly let down this generous offer

39:18.900 --> 39:21.940
and ask for a different form of Christmas bonus?

39:22.500 --> 39:24.180
That's from Marooned in Michigan,

39:24.180 --> 39:25.940
and I think I speak for all of us when I say,

39:25.940 --> 39:27.620
well, holy fucking shit.

39:28.180 --> 39:30.900
Yeah, are you fucking with me right now?

39:30.900 --> 39:35.700
I cannot imagine more of like a setup spike

39:35.700 --> 39:38.660
than like, I got you a cruise with me.

39:39.300 --> 39:43.700
This seems like the makings of like the next

39:43.700 --> 39:48.340
Bad Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly feature film.

39:48.340 --> 39:53.380
I feel like this seems like the plot of a film

39:53.380 --> 39:54.660
more than it does a real thing.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.180
Wasn't this like an Adam Sandler,

39:56.180 --> 39:57.460
Drew Barrymore thing where it's like,

39:57.460 --> 39:58.580
you're gonna go on a trip,

39:58.580 --> 40:00.260
but you gotta go with this person.

40:00.260 --> 40:02.100
I think it was called Flipped.

40:02.100 --> 40:02.660
Flipped.

40:02.660 --> 40:03.460
Flipped.

40:03.460 --> 40:04.500
Flipped the trip.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.780
Flipped our Africa trip.

40:05.780 --> 40:06.280
Yeah.

40:07.700 --> 40:08.900
I think it's called Flipped.

40:10.660 --> 40:11.780
I think it's called Flips.

40:12.340 --> 40:13.620
If you say enough nouns,

40:13.620 --> 40:17.220
eventually you will say the name of a Drew Carey, Adam Sandler.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.100
Drew Barrymore film.

40:20.100 --> 40:21.460
Drew Careymore.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.500
Drew Careymore is the name.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.180
That's their celebrity couple name.

40:24.180 --> 40:24.980
Here's what you do.

40:25.780 --> 40:26.660
Man, I have a pitch.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.380
And it's gonna take a little bit of acting,

40:29.380 --> 40:30.980
but I think you can do it.

40:30.980 --> 40:33.220
You're gonna make direct eye contact with your boss

40:33.220 --> 40:35.540
and say in the interim, since the last group,

40:35.540 --> 40:37.540
which, oh yes, you did have a wonderful time,

40:37.540 --> 40:40.820
but in the interim, you watched on the same night

40:40.820 --> 40:43.380
Pirates of the Caribbean and Captain Phillips,

40:43.380 --> 40:45.940
and now you can never go on a ship again.

40:45.940 --> 40:48.820
Are you equating the events of those two movies

40:48.820 --> 40:50.500
in any way, Travis?

40:50.500 --> 40:52.180
Pirates take over a ship, Griffin?

40:52.180 --> 40:52.580
I don't know.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.020
Maybe they have a little bit in common.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.580
Maybe they have a little in common, Griffin.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.980
Not in terms of whimsy, they don't.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.660
Their whimsy sort of meters

41:02.660 --> 41:05.060
are on completely different sides of the spectrum.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.900
I haven't seen Captain Phillips.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.380
No, I have to apologize also

41:09.380 --> 41:11.460
if you get any background noise on my feed.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.580
The Ocean's Eleven guys are here

41:14.580 --> 41:16.020
and they're trying to steal my whole house.

41:17.540 --> 41:18.740
Oh, that's another one you could say.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.980
Ocean's Eleven, that doesn't take place on a cruise ship,

41:20.980 --> 41:23.700
but you're just afraid of general crime at this part.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.300
Maybe there's a casino on the cruise ship.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.340
I think fear-based is the way.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.300
That's the way you're gonna wanna go.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.740
We need to step into this question

41:30.740 --> 41:31.860
because we're having a lot of fun here,

41:31.860 --> 41:33.860
but we need to get our hands fucking dirty

41:33.860 --> 41:36.020
and decide what this person's gonna do.

41:36.020 --> 41:36.980
We're making goof-em-ups

41:36.980 --> 41:38.660
and we're talking about Captain Phillips and stuff,

41:38.660 --> 41:42.180
but we really, really need to get bone deep in this one,

41:42.180 --> 41:42.740
I feel like.

41:44.500 --> 41:47.620
Maybe, ooh, is there a patsy in your office

41:47.620 --> 41:51.860
that you can be like, listen, I can't take all the cruise fun.

41:52.500 --> 41:55.540
Sharon was saying the other day how much she loves cruises.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.020
Maybe she and her partner wanna go with you

41:58.020 --> 41:59.940
this year and you make it like a rotating,

41:59.940 --> 42:02.020
oh, like employee of the year bonus,

42:02.020 --> 42:02.900
and then you do a shitty job.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.420
You do a horrible job.

42:05.220 --> 42:06.100
Probably not.

42:06.100 --> 42:08.340
I don't think that one would work, honestly,

42:08.340 --> 42:10.820
because I think that he's crazy for cruises with you.

42:11.780 --> 42:12.900
Just wild for him.

42:13.940 --> 42:17.380
Maybe you could go one more time, but really tank this one.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.940
Like you eat all the shrimp and you forgot your sandals,

42:21.940 --> 42:24.740
so you have to wear business shoes to the pool.

42:24.740 --> 42:27.940
So this is the script for Dude Cruise 2,

42:27.940 --> 42:32.580
which is the second one with Will and John,

42:32.580 --> 42:34.420
and they are getting together on this one,

42:34.420 --> 42:36.580
but this time they wanna have a bad cruise,

42:36.580 --> 42:39.380
because in Dude Cruise 1, they had a great time.

42:39.380 --> 42:40.660
They met their wives.

42:41.380 --> 42:44.020
Crab grabbed onto Will's penis.

42:45.060 --> 42:45.700
And in this one-

42:45.700 --> 42:46.900
But in a good way.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.180
You saw that in the trailer.

42:48.180 --> 42:51.460
Good for me as the viewer, how funny it was.

42:52.020 --> 42:54.020
But in this one, two crabs get on there,

42:54.020 --> 42:55.300
but they have a bad time.

42:55.300 --> 43:00.980
In Dude Cruise 2, something's gone sour on the seven seas.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.620
It's a long poster, but it's a film.

43:03.620 --> 43:08.340
It's a widescreen sort of landscape poster.

43:08.340 --> 43:10.500
Our first landscape poster.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.980
Film historians all agree

43:12.980 --> 43:18.500
that the first ever landscape poster was for Dude Cruise 2.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.980
Sorry, what was the subtitle of the film again?

43:20.980 --> 43:24.260
Something's gone sour on the seven seas?

43:24.260 --> 43:27.060
I believe that's correct, yes.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.740
Now, Griffin, are you saying that

43:28.740 --> 43:32.260
they're gonna have a bad time because it's a bad time,

43:32.260 --> 43:35.300
or that the movie wants us, the audience,

43:35.300 --> 43:37.700
to stop coming to the Dude Cruise movies

43:37.700 --> 43:38.660
so they can stop coming?

43:38.660 --> 43:40.580
Oh, it's like a sabotage.

43:40.580 --> 43:42.260
I don't even think they could pull that off.

43:42.260 --> 43:43.940
There's nothing they could do on that screen

43:43.940 --> 43:45.940
that would make me not come back for the next one.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.180
For Dude Cruise 3, Cruise to the Moon?

43:48.180 --> 43:50.340
I'm just tantalized by the idea of three crabs

43:50.340 --> 43:52.660
hanging off of Will Ferrell's ruined member.

43:53.220 --> 43:55.140
How many more crabs can he put on there?

43:58.020 --> 43:59.300
Yeah, sure, I got one here.

43:59.860 --> 44:01.540
This one was sent in by several people.

44:01.540 --> 44:02.100
Thanks, everyone.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.180
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Jenny, who asks,

44:04.820 --> 44:06.980
cat smelled my vape?

44:06.980 --> 44:07.700
Is that okay?

44:08.500 --> 44:09.860
I was playing around with my vape,

44:09.860 --> 44:10.980
and my cat was beside me.

44:10.980 --> 44:14.180
It was turned on, and my cat, the vape, I assume,

44:14.900 --> 44:15.780
was turned on.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.140
The cat like, I'm alive!

44:17.860 --> 44:19.300
It was turned on, and my cat came over

44:19.300 --> 44:22.740
and smelled it directly in front of the mouthpiece.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.260
I didn't know if it was bad for cats

44:24.260 --> 44:25.460
until I did some research after.

44:25.460 --> 44:27.380
Now I'm really concerned if the cat gonna be okay.

44:28.580 --> 44:30.820
So the concern is that in smelling it,

44:30.820 --> 44:32.260
it was ripping mad cotton, right?

44:32.260 --> 44:36.500
It was so close to the carb or whatever,

44:36.500 --> 44:41.060
and did what I do when it's time for me to do my tricks

44:41.060 --> 44:43.060
at the street corner.

44:43.060 --> 44:47.860
And like I didn't see any of that delicious fog

44:47.860 --> 44:51.380
come out of the cat, but maybe it was just, you know.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.620
Oh, maybe it's still holding it.

44:53.620 --> 44:54.660
It might still be.

44:57.060 --> 44:59.540
And so like three weeks from now,

44:59.540 --> 45:02.420
you're gonna open up, you know, the can of Fancy Feast,

45:02.420 --> 45:04.100
and he's just gonna look up at you like,

45:04.100 --> 45:05.380
baaahhh!

45:07.380 --> 45:08.900
Fuck you, Denny!

45:10.340 --> 45:11.860
You said I couldn't rip.

45:11.860 --> 45:14.340
I couldn't rip, I can rip.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.380
Nah, it's possible.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.820
Then that's not good.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.500
I don't think you're supposed to keep that stuff

45:18.500 --> 45:19.540
in there that long.

45:19.540 --> 45:21.700
Do they make special vape juice for cats?

45:23.060 --> 45:24.100
It's all like tuna.

45:24.740 --> 45:25.700
Or like catnip.

45:25.700 --> 45:26.340
Imagine that.

45:26.340 --> 45:28.980
Like I breathe out just a mad cloud,

45:29.540 --> 45:31.300
and my cat's just like, I love it.

45:31.300 --> 45:33.460
And there's my cat like swirling around in it,

45:33.460 --> 45:34.820
having a good old time.

45:34.820 --> 45:35.540
What if you're-

45:35.540 --> 45:39.780
I'm dead cause I inhaled catnip, but it's okay.

45:39.780 --> 45:42.900
He loves your corpse, he's wild about it.

45:42.900 --> 45:45.060
I don't think you need to make it more addictive for cats.

45:45.060 --> 45:48.660
Cats are already so prone to get addicted to vaping.

45:48.660 --> 45:50.340
I don't feel like you want to make it taste

45:50.340 --> 45:51.300
like something that-

45:51.300 --> 45:52.900
Actually, I don't know, is it taste?

45:52.900 --> 45:55.460
I don't know what drives him so wild about catnip,

45:55.460 --> 45:57.540
honestly, I'm not sure the mechanics.

45:57.540 --> 45:59.300
I think it's just that it's forbidden.

45:59.300 --> 46:00.500
Yeah, is it forbidden?

46:00.500 --> 46:01.700
Okay, that's how they know.

46:01.700 --> 46:04.100
Because it's still a schedule one drug,

46:04.820 --> 46:07.380
so when cats get a chance to get catnip,

46:07.380 --> 46:09.540
they just go fucking crazy because they're like,

46:09.540 --> 46:10.980
who knows, then I'll get more catnip.

46:10.980 --> 46:12.740
I don't have a car or a job.

46:13.620 --> 46:18.260
If we were to develop a brand of vape juice accessories,

46:18.820 --> 46:24.260
carbs, turbo batteries, and what have you,

46:26.100 --> 46:28.500
tanks, and all of it,

46:28.500 --> 46:30.980
I'm thinking specifically of the juices and the flavors

46:30.980 --> 46:36.020
were designed so that humans and cats could both enjoy it.

46:36.020 --> 46:38.340
So you and your buddy could pass them back and forth, right?

46:38.340 --> 46:44.740
Because I don't want to give a huff of strawberry sex

46:44.740 --> 46:47.940
or whatever I'm huffing today over to the kitty

46:47.940 --> 46:50.980
because they might not enjoy it.

46:50.980 --> 46:53.140
But I don't want to have the stinky tuna

46:53.140 --> 46:55.220
like Travis suggested in my mouth.

46:55.220 --> 46:57.620
So what's the compromise here?

46:57.620 --> 46:58.980
So you're talking about what's the flavor

46:58.980 --> 46:59.940
or what's the brand name?

46:59.940 --> 47:00.660
What's the flavor?

47:00.660 --> 47:02.500
I don't know, I'll think of the brand name later.

47:02.500 --> 47:03.460
This is my bim bam.

47:04.420 --> 47:05.940
Maybe saucer of milk?

47:05.940 --> 47:08.420
90 people will tweet at us with the brand name.

47:08.420 --> 47:08.820
You know what?

47:08.820 --> 47:09.620
I like cream.

47:10.180 --> 47:11.460
Kitty like cream.

47:11.460 --> 47:13.860
Cream vape is not good for me, I think.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.980
Kitty like cream.

47:16.980 --> 47:17.940
Kitty like cream?

47:17.940 --> 47:18.740
Yeah, sure.

47:18.740 --> 47:19.780
I don't want milk.

47:19.780 --> 47:21.700
I don't like any sort of milk in my vape.

47:21.700 --> 47:27.060
I love a creamy, round, vanilla cream.

47:27.060 --> 47:27.940
Oh, just a cream?

47:27.940 --> 47:28.420
Lap it up.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.140
Lap it up is-

47:31.140 --> 47:33.140
Oh, lap it up would be a good name for a brand, yeah.

47:33.140 --> 47:34.100
It's just challenging.

47:34.100 --> 47:35.860
It's challenging when you say lap it up.

47:35.860 --> 47:37.780
What if, if there's some way-

47:37.780 --> 47:39.380
Can we just put cream in the tank?

47:40.740 --> 47:42.340
The problem is you can only do that once.

47:42.340 --> 47:43.940
Gotta crank your ohms.

47:43.940 --> 47:46.660
Gotta ask you good ohms though to get through that cream.

47:46.660 --> 47:48.980
I got 1.21 gigabots.

47:50.580 --> 47:51.780
Don't worry about it.

47:51.780 --> 47:52.740
Is there a way-

47:52.740 --> 47:54.020
I love Star Trek jokes,

47:54.020 --> 47:56.420
but that is actually gonna start a fire in your mouth

47:56.420 --> 47:59.140
and I don't think you should try to vape cream.

47:59.140 --> 48:00.980
Is there a way to have a flavor

48:00.980 --> 48:04.500
that when the cat tastes it tastes like Dave killed a mouse,

48:04.500 --> 48:06.100
but when I taste it,

48:06.100 --> 48:08.660
tastes like the peace of mind I have

48:08.660 --> 48:10.420
knowing that my kitty kills the mice?

48:12.500 --> 48:16.020
That was the most abstract thought

48:16.020 --> 48:19.140
that has ever been communicated via this podcast.

48:19.140 --> 48:20.580
Or the English language, I feel like.

48:20.580 --> 48:23.140
That was the most challenging abstract thought

48:23.140 --> 48:25.380
I've ever heard on this exact show.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.820
Listen, what I make is art

48:26.820 --> 48:28.260
and it's up to your interpretation.

48:28.260 --> 48:30.020
I'm not here to tell you how to feel

48:30.020 --> 48:32.500
about the complicated idea I just laid before you.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.940
You look at it, you sit on that bench,

48:33.940 --> 48:35.940
maybe you try to draw it for your art class,

48:35.940 --> 48:38.740
you do a shitty job because you're not where I am.

48:38.740 --> 48:39.700
That's my art.

48:40.660 --> 48:42.020
Travis is like Jackson Pollock,

48:42.020 --> 48:45.220
but instead of paint diarrhea, it's like thought diarrhea.

48:45.220 --> 48:46.260
That's correct.

48:47.060 --> 48:47.700
Lap it up.

48:48.660 --> 48:52.580
Jesus also lasagna flavored.

48:53.780 --> 48:55.140
Oh, nailed it.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.340
Two things are those.

48:56.900 --> 48:58.340
I work at an escape room.

48:59.700 --> 49:01.780
For the most part, I love my job.

49:01.780 --> 49:03.540
Real quick, I gotta place an embargo right here.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.420
We can't talk about the cool escape rooms we've gone on

49:06.420 --> 49:08.020
because that'll take 25 minutes.

49:08.020 --> 49:09.140
Okay, continue.

49:09.140 --> 49:10.660
We'll save that for the after show.

49:10.660 --> 49:13.380
But I will say that if you come to the lost escape room

49:13.380 --> 49:15.300
in Huntington, you're in an area,

49:16.260 --> 49:18.260
our dad is in like three of them.

49:18.820 --> 49:19.940
In like the videos.

49:19.940 --> 49:20.740
Not in the room.

49:22.100 --> 49:24.980
He might be in the room, but he is in the videos.

49:24.980 --> 49:27.140
Please free our daddy from the escape room.

49:27.140 --> 49:27.700
Tell no one.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.980
I think he's a private detective.

49:28.980 --> 49:29.700
It's amazing.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.220
Anyway, I love my job,

49:31.220 --> 49:33.860
but I really struggle when teams who are very terrible

49:33.860 --> 49:35.620
at the whole thing ask how they did.

49:35.620 --> 49:37.460
Usually I mumble some nonsense

49:37.460 --> 49:39.380
about how they solved a particular puzzle.

49:39.380 --> 49:40.420
I fear it's very obvious.

49:40.420 --> 49:41.940
I'm grasping at straws.

49:41.940 --> 49:43.620
What's the convenient line I could use

49:43.620 --> 49:46.740
for these hapless dummies to ask me this dreaded question?

49:46.740 --> 49:49.780
And it's from artisanal escape in Astoria.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.660
What kind of person do you have to be

49:52.660 --> 49:55.540
to do a very bad job and lose an escape room,

49:55.540 --> 49:57.060
but then also be like, how'd I do?

49:58.180 --> 50:00.180
Like, well, hypothetically,

50:00.180 --> 50:03.220
you would have died in there if that was a real room,

50:03.220 --> 50:04.580
so bad?

50:04.580 --> 50:05.620
I mean, you lie,

50:05.620 --> 50:08.340
but you need to do so while making eye contact

50:08.340 --> 50:10.580
with the actually good people in that group,

50:10.580 --> 50:13.220
who I guarantee are 50 times more frustrated

50:13.220 --> 50:14.660
than you are at that moment.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.140
Right.

50:15.140 --> 50:16.500
Or go the other way and be like,

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
you're the only one who really solved it.

50:18.500 --> 50:21.620
Remember how you became so focused on that lamp

50:21.620 --> 50:23.860
and everybody else told you that the lamp was nothing

50:23.860 --> 50:24.900
and to leave the lamp alone

50:24.900 --> 50:26.500
because you spent 20 minutes on the lamp

50:26.500 --> 50:27.700
and it was just a lamp?

50:28.580 --> 50:29.460
You were right.

50:29.460 --> 50:30.260
You were right.

50:30.260 --> 50:32.660
Remember when you walked in and the lamp was the room?

50:32.660 --> 50:33.860
Do you remember when you walked over

50:33.860 --> 50:35.860
and you knocked all the chess pieces off the board,

50:35.860 --> 50:38.740
making the entire room unsolvable for everyone?

50:38.740 --> 50:41.380
That was so smart.

50:41.380 --> 50:43.300
That was so smart and cool.

50:43.300 --> 50:45.140
Do you remember when you ate one of the cookies

50:45.140 --> 50:46.100
that was on the plate

50:46.100 --> 50:47.620
and the number of cookies answered

50:47.620 --> 50:48.980
how to get out of the room?

50:48.980 --> 50:52.180
Do you remember we told you not to fool

50:52.180 --> 50:54.180
with the outlets or the vents

50:54.180 --> 50:57.220
and you unscrewed that one vent with your keys

50:57.220 --> 51:00.180
and tried to climb in it like John McClane?

51:01.540 --> 51:03.380
Your arm and head got stuck

51:03.380 --> 51:05.780
and we called the fire department

51:05.780 --> 51:08.820
and they had to come ply you out with the jaws of life

51:08.820 --> 51:10.980
and you lost your pinky finger.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.980
That was actually, you were very close.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.660
You were so close.

51:14.660 --> 51:15.860
You were supposed to lose your thumb.

51:16.660 --> 51:17.700
There was a key.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.100
If you just reached a little farther, there was a key.

51:20.100 --> 51:21.540
When you kept loudly suggesting

51:21.540 --> 51:24.980
that if everyone just kept farting at the same time,

51:24.980 --> 51:27.780
the pressure would blow the front door wide open,

51:27.780 --> 51:29.220
that you're the only one

51:29.220 --> 51:32.980
and good news, now you're the puzzle master.

51:32.980 --> 51:36.820
Wouldn't it be fun to have a puzzle escape room

51:36.820 --> 51:38.260
where at the end of it they lost

51:38.260 --> 51:41.620
and you say, well, did you pry the power outlets

51:41.620 --> 51:42.900
off the wall?

51:42.900 --> 51:45.780
They said, no, you told us specifically not to do that.

51:45.780 --> 51:47.940
It's like, huh, well, twist.

51:47.940 --> 51:50.100
I guess you still learned a little something today.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.260
Nothing is what it seems.

51:52.260 --> 51:53.620
Nothing is what it seems.

51:53.620 --> 51:55.620
I also said nothing is what it seems.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.900
Wouldn't you guys fucking love to make up an escape room?

52:02.900 --> 52:03.940
I think it would be so fun.

52:03.940 --> 52:07.540
I think I would, but then I would be so mad.

52:07.540 --> 52:08.980
I would be watching on the monitors

52:08.980 --> 52:11.380
and they'd solve a puzzle that I thought was really hard,

52:11.380 --> 52:13.060
but they do it in like 30 seconds

52:13.060 --> 52:15.140
and I just go down there and I'm like, no,

52:15.140 --> 52:16.500
you don't appreciate this enough.

52:16.500 --> 52:17.000
Leave.

52:17.540 --> 52:18.020
You're done.

52:18.020 --> 52:18.500
You escaped.

52:18.500 --> 52:20.660
You're rushing for your way.

52:20.660 --> 52:21.460
Gotta enjoy it.

52:21.460 --> 52:22.340
Savor the lock.

52:22.340 --> 52:23.300
Savor the lock.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.980
Did you smell the puzzle?

52:24.980 --> 52:26.340
I did a good job.

52:26.340 --> 52:28.100
I don't know why the escape rooms have

52:28.100 --> 52:30.420
to only challenge the mind.

52:30.420 --> 52:30.920
Yes.

52:31.940 --> 52:35.540
Why not have a big oiled man in the final,

52:35.540 --> 52:38.500
standing between you and the actual open door out

52:38.500 --> 52:39.140
of the place?

52:42.900 --> 52:43.780
So you open the-

52:43.780 --> 52:44.900
You do the code.

52:44.900 --> 52:46.420
Fresh air awaiting.

52:48.420 --> 52:49.620
Read the globe.

52:49.620 --> 52:50.740
You connect the dots.

52:50.740 --> 52:51.700
You turn off the light.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.860
You use the black light to find the four numbers,

52:53.860 --> 52:56.660
to turn the key, to swallow the cat, to eat the fly,

52:56.660 --> 52:58.980
and you open the door to the final lock.

52:59.940 --> 53:00.980
And there's Brutus.

53:00.980 --> 53:02.980
And there is a sign above him that says,

53:02.980 --> 53:03.620
fight the man.

53:04.260 --> 53:05.380
Fight the man.

53:05.380 --> 53:06.580
Fight the man for clue.

53:09.860 --> 53:11.380
Fight man for freedom.

53:11.380 --> 53:12.660
Fight man for clue.

53:13.460 --> 53:15.860
And sitting next to him is a six foot party sob

53:15.860 --> 53:18.180
you have to finish before you can get out the door.

53:18.180 --> 53:18.660
Yeah.

53:18.660 --> 53:22.740
Eating challenge, mind, body, stomach, everything.

53:22.740 --> 53:23.620
Fight man.

53:23.620 --> 53:23.860
Clue.

53:23.860 --> 53:25.780
And maybe just a challenging concept.

53:27.620 --> 53:29.940
And what do you think about the idea of faith?

53:29.940 --> 53:31.140
And you're like, oh, shit.

53:31.140 --> 53:31.700
Oh, shit.

53:31.700 --> 53:32.200
Okay.

53:33.620 --> 53:34.660
The clue's in the man.

53:36.820 --> 53:37.620
Unlock man.

53:38.500 --> 53:40.020
Unlock man.

53:40.020 --> 53:40.740
Fight clue.

53:41.380 --> 53:42.660
Use clue on man.

53:42.660 --> 53:44.580
Use clue on man.

53:44.580 --> 53:46.020
Use carrot on man?

53:46.020 --> 53:47.540
Aw, man ain't carrot.

53:47.540 --> 53:51.540
I like to stand in escape rooms and just say west, west, west.

53:52.260 --> 53:53.300
Use door.

53:53.300 --> 53:53.780
Damn it.

53:54.420 --> 53:55.620
Use note on door.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.620
Oh, fight man.

53:59.460 --> 53:59.940
That's good.

53:59.940 --> 54:01.300
Make you try hug man.

54:01.300 --> 54:02.340
You would have had it.

54:02.340 --> 54:03.540
Yeah, you did actually.

54:03.540 --> 54:04.900
Love was the answer the whole time.

54:04.900 --> 54:05.700
You had to debate it.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.060
Love man, love self.

54:07.780 --> 54:09.300
Debate him about climate change.

54:09.300 --> 54:10.740
It wasn't a physical fight.

54:10.740 --> 54:14.100
God, he's a scientist who takes care of himself.

54:14.100 --> 54:15.700
He's just an in-shape scientist.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.940
What about your preconceived notions?

54:17.940 --> 54:19.460
Maybe that was the true challenge.

54:20.260 --> 54:22.420
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

54:22.420 --> 54:23.700
We got a little bit more for you.

54:25.700 --> 54:30.100
Live from our live appearance at podcast convention too.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.620
Thanks again for coming out to it.

54:31.620 --> 54:37.700
And thank you to everyone we met there who was so very nice.

54:37.700 --> 54:38.420
We had a great time.

54:38.420 --> 54:39.380
We hope you did too.

54:39.380 --> 54:41.060
So that's going to do it for us, folks.

54:41.060 --> 54:44.340
So let's get without any further ado.

54:44.340 --> 54:45.220
Let's get back into the show.

54:46.180 --> 54:47.380
Hello, my name is Taylor.

54:47.380 --> 54:48.660
My pronouns are she, her.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.620
Hi, hi, Taylor.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.260
Hello.

54:50.980 --> 54:51.380
Okay.

54:51.380 --> 54:56.100
So I have a new boss at my office job and her and one of my co-workers do not get along.

54:57.140 --> 55:05.460
Sometimes they'll go into my boss's office and they like to have, I guess, quiet arguments.

55:05.460 --> 55:11.700
So my question is, what's the best way to eavesdrop so that I can, because sometimes

55:11.700 --> 55:14.660
like sometimes you can just hear them because they're loud enough.

55:14.660 --> 55:19.540
But other times it's like standing in my co-worker's doorway that's next to theirs.

55:19.540 --> 55:20.180
Okay.

55:20.980 --> 55:23.140
You got to have, you got to have the juice.

55:23.140 --> 55:23.380
Right.

55:24.100 --> 55:24.740
Got it.

55:24.740 --> 55:24.980
Okay.

55:25.540 --> 55:27.460
And what is your, your name and question?

55:27.460 --> 55:29.060
Hi, my name is Lisa.

55:29.060 --> 55:29.700
Lisa.

55:29.700 --> 55:30.020
Yeah.

55:30.020 --> 55:30.900
Pronouns she, her.

55:32.420 --> 55:35.780
My friend set me up with her fiance's cousin and-

55:35.780 --> 55:37.220
Oh, thank God you finished that.

55:37.220 --> 55:44.340
And on that setup, he threw up on my shoes and feet.

55:45.700 --> 55:48.740
She's planning on sitting me next to him at her wedding.

55:49.780 --> 55:53.620
How do I interact or get away from that?

55:54.660 --> 55:54.980
I really-

55:54.980 --> 55:56.740
Did the date go well other one?

55:57.380 --> 55:58.340
No, no.

55:59.220 --> 56:00.740
It was a real Prince Charming.

56:01.540 --> 56:03.380
There was one part.

56:03.380 --> 56:09.300
Uh, I want to do that question very badly, uh, because again, I don't know the best way

56:09.300 --> 56:12.100
to tell you to install a bug in your boss's office.

56:12.100 --> 56:13.380
That's going to sound ethical.

56:13.380 --> 56:18.180
I would, I would actually try just like walking past and just say like, King louder.

56:18.180 --> 56:18.660
Yeah.

56:18.660 --> 56:19.140
Please.

56:20.020 --> 56:21.540
Or, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

56:21.540 --> 56:21.940
Okay.

56:21.940 --> 56:22.420
Wait, hold on.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.220
I can help very quickly.

56:24.180 --> 56:27.620
Whisper into their ear as they're talking to, can I just take a moment?

56:28.180 --> 56:31.460
They said the meanest thing just a second ago.

56:31.460 --> 56:35.460
Just a second ago, you would not believe it and try to make them angrier.

56:35.460 --> 56:38.980
Cause if they're like really starting up, they might get into it a little deeper.

56:38.980 --> 56:41.220
Or just lean in and go, what are you arguing about?

56:41.780 --> 56:44.420
Hey, I want them writing it down.

56:45.620 --> 56:47.300
I learned shorthand for this.

56:47.300 --> 56:49.540
HR says I have to hear all of that.

56:50.900 --> 56:54.580
That happened once we had to call HR down because they were yelling very

56:54.580 --> 56:56.020
loudly and it was disturbing other people.

56:56.020 --> 56:57.220
That's why they whisper now.

56:57.220 --> 56:57.700
Okay.

56:57.700 --> 56:57.940
Yeah.

56:57.940 --> 57:01.700
Yeah, tell them it's a, tell them you're on a special HR mission

57:01.700 --> 57:02.900
and you have to listen to everyone.

57:02.900 --> 57:05.300
Tell them HR said this, it was too quiet now.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.580
They had to find a middle ground.

57:08.340 --> 57:08.660
Right.

57:08.660 --> 57:09.460
Does that help?

57:09.460 --> 57:09.940
Yeah.

57:09.940 --> 57:10.500
Average.

57:10.500 --> 57:11.300
Thank you, Taylor.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.940
And then I want to, I want to address the other one too.

57:15.700 --> 57:17.780
You asked what to do in that situation.

57:17.780 --> 57:22.340
I think the first thing you need to do is cheat a little bit to the right with the

57:22.340 --> 57:25.460
way that you're sitting next to this, next to this person.

57:25.460 --> 57:27.700
I say that they're probably, can I say something?

57:27.700 --> 57:29.540
They're probably not going to barf on you again.

57:30.340 --> 57:33.220
And you know, here's the wonderful thing about social anxiety.

57:33.220 --> 57:35.780
I bet they're more nervous than you are.

57:35.780 --> 57:36.420
I'd hope so.

57:36.420 --> 57:37.700
They were my favorite shoes.

57:38.420 --> 57:39.060
What?

57:39.060 --> 57:39.300
What?

57:39.300 --> 57:41.780
They were my favorite shoes and suede.

57:41.780 --> 57:42.500
Oh no.

57:43.940 --> 57:46.820
Did they refund, like pay for the shoes?

57:47.460 --> 57:50.260
No, he texted me the next day and I just never responded.

57:51.300 --> 57:51.700
Yeah.

57:51.700 --> 57:53.540
Well, you made the right choice there, I think.

57:53.540 --> 57:58.740
I think, although what a story that would have been.

57:58.740 --> 57:59.300
Yeah.

57:59.300 --> 58:00.180
How did you meet?

58:00.180 --> 58:04.260
Well, I wasn't sure at first, but it's what's inside that counts.

58:09.860 --> 58:10.660
Does that help?

58:11.380 --> 58:12.260
Definitely, yeah.

58:12.260 --> 58:13.060
Okay, excellent.

58:14.580 --> 58:18.660
Folks, thank you so much for coming to our podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me.

58:18.660 --> 58:29.620
If you would like some merchandise based on our program, there are t-shirts and pins,

58:29.620 --> 58:34.580
some of which like pins you can't get online anymore over at the DFTBA booth over there.

58:34.580 --> 58:36.340
So go get them.

58:37.300 --> 58:37.540
Get it.

58:37.540 --> 58:38.900
It's Apple time.

58:38.900 --> 58:40.260
Apple time, folks.

58:40.260 --> 58:40.980
Apple time.

So, but everybody does.

58:48.820 --> 58:51.060
So check out everyone else's stuff.

58:51.060 --> 58:52.260
Thank you all so much for coming.

58:52.260 --> 58:53.140
Like, this is wonderful.

58:53.140 --> 58:54.020
Yeah, this is incredible.

58:55.540 --> 58:56.420
Thank you.

58:56.420 --> 58:59.700
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

58:59.700 --> 59:03.060
Maximum Fun is a great place for us to do our thousand podcasts,

59:03.060 --> 59:04.820
and we are very appreciative of them.

59:04.820 --> 59:07.620
And to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these four theme songs.

59:07.620 --> 59:09.460
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

59:10.820 --> 59:14.100
Every week on My Brother, My Brother and Me, Griffin has like a final-

59:14.100 --> 59:15.300
Don't exit yet.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.980
Wait, hold on.

59:16.980 --> 59:18.180
There's still more goof.

59:18.740 --> 59:20.260
There's lots of good stuff coming.

59:20.260 --> 59:21.940
I mean, if you all need to go, please go ahead.

59:21.940 --> 59:23.300
Just don't start a stand.

59:23.300 --> 59:24.500
And leave me some pizza.

59:27.460 --> 59:29.460
There's a last question that Griffin says,

59:29.460 --> 59:31.700
and then we pretend like we're going to talk about it later.

59:31.700 --> 59:32.660
Here it comes.

59:32.660 --> 59:34.580
This one was sent in by Sid Ross.

59:34.580 --> 59:35.300
Thank you, Sid.

59:35.300 --> 59:39.940
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call.

59:41.780 --> 59:46.900
Jamison asks, does anyone else crush up Pringles?

59:46.900 --> 59:50.820
Pour some on the lid and then eat them like a pet licking water from a bowl?

59:50.820 --> 59:52.100
Or is that just me?

59:53.460 --> 59:55.140
My name is Justin McElroy.

59:55.140 --> 59:56.180
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:56.180 --> 59:57.140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:57.140 --> 59:58.340
It's been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

59:58.340 --> 01:00:17.860
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.620
And I'm Julia Prescott.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.340
And we're the hosts of Everything's Coming Up Simpsons.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.460
Every episode, we cover a different episode of The Simpsons.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.460
That is a favorite of our special guests.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.380
We've had guests that are showrunners and writers and voice actors like Nancy Cartwright.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.820
And we've also had people that are on the Max Fun Network already.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.900
We've had Weird Al Yankovic on the show.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.540
I was just struck by how sharp the writing is.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.460
I mean, that's no surprise because it's The Simpsons.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.340
But I mean, you can't say that about a lot of TV shows,

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.540
particularly ones that at that point had been on the air for 14 years.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.100
Find us on MaximumFun.org, iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.580
All right.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:26.820
Smell you later.
