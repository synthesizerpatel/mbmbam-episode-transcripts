WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.200 --> 00:51.920
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.920 --> 00:59.120
Just hear those T-R-A-V-E-I-S bells. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.120
I'm your sweet baby brother, Dash for the reindeer McElroy.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.200
Hold on, I'll be right back. What?

01:05.200 --> 01:07.600
I don't know if this is for the show or not. I don't know either.

01:07.600 --> 01:13.280
I think he might have just flown off to take Santa and all his crazy reindeer.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.080
But we're still making show. Yeah?

01:16.080 --> 01:18.880
Just works just fine without Griffin. Yeah, have you noticed?

01:18.880 --> 01:21.280
I think it flows better. I think the chemistry is there.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.680
Same show, basically, without Griffin. A lot of, it feels like a lot of dead air

01:25.680 --> 01:32.400
is gone. This is all 100% usable content. Salvageable content. Well, you know what?

01:32.400 --> 01:34.800
I could go ahead and tell people this is our candle night special.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.120
Indeed it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're celebrating our fake holiday.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.040
Hey. Hey, Griff, you okay?

01:41.040 --> 01:46.560
Yeah, I've been waiting on a gift for Rachel that I would need to sign for that I needed to

01:46.560 --> 01:49.520
intercept. Oh, was it from Santa?

01:49.520 --> 01:54.240
I tried to do that because I got Sydney a rug to replace the rug that the cat pissed on.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.680
And there was no cool way to do it because we're both at the house all the time.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.760
I got her a nursery rocker, too, and that one showed up in a big box from Wayfair that was

02:05.760 --> 02:13.360
like, hey, Rachel, here's your nursery rocker. Griffin got it for you. Merry Christmas.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.120
There was no- Did Carrie Carrie do it?

02:15.120 --> 02:18.320
I hope she's not a listener because this- This isn't the show.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.600
Oh, my mistake. Oh, how embarrassing.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.200
Justin and I thought it was the show this whole time.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.280
Yeah, the show was continuing. Some really choice stuff.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.320
So this is Candlelightz. It is our- And I'm Griffin McElroy.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.280
Let's start. What do you guys think about starting over?

02:33.280 --> 02:37.360
No, no. Are you kidding me? There's three minutes of quality stuff there.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.920
Well, I was going to say salvageable. Okay.

02:41.200 --> 02:46.560
This is exciting for so many reasons. One, it is our Candlelightz Spectacular.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.560
Of course. That means no cursing in this one.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.080
Oh, beans. Can we just- It's our second Candlelightz Spectacular,

02:54.080 --> 02:58.160
really, if you think about it. Yes. The other one is a video that you can

02:58.160 --> 03:02.960
still watch if you go to bit.ly forward slash Candlelightz 2020.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.120
It's available until January 4th. It's a two-hour long Spectacular full of tons of

03:08.160 --> 03:13.840
great bits and skits and goofs and songs and dances and celebrity cameos and holiday festivities and

03:13.840 --> 03:25.040
and cocktails and it's got everything and it's $6.25 to get it and proceeds are going to Harmony

03:25.040 --> 03:28.640
House, which is a shelter for people experiencing homelessness in our area.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.280
So my area, I should say. Although we still claim the voice.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.080
So please go do that if you have not already done it.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.120
You got until January 4th to watch it. Okay. But that's just a video.

03:39.120 --> 03:43.200
This is still the podcast Candlelightz. This is the one that counts.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.680
This is the- No, they both count. No, this is the one.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.400
That one? This one counts less because it's free.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.720
Oh, man. Yeah, it's not as valuable.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.560
This one's free? We're going to not be using swear words.

03:54.560 --> 04:00.320
So if you want to gather your family around the radio, Victrola,

04:01.120 --> 04:02.880
we're just going to be doing a show without swears.

04:02.880 --> 04:08.080
Now, can we use alternate swears? Sorry, just like beans and butterscotch.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.880
You guys remember like frack, like from- Frack it.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.480
Frack, yeah. From Bubble Star. H-E double hockey six.

04:15.120 --> 04:20.320
Sorry, did you say Bubble Star? Bubble Star Galactica.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.040
Bubble Star Galactica. Bubble Star Metallica.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.680
Oh, frack, I miss Bubble Star Metallica.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.200
We also always mention this and it is a fact that just because it doesn't have bad words

04:39.200 --> 04:41.040
doesn't mean a lot of challenging ideas. Yeah.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.000
Oh, boy. And just to reinforce that,

04:44.000 --> 04:49.600
I would like to start with an anecdote. Two nights ago, or two days ago, rather,

04:49.600 --> 04:56.880
I was in the shower getting rid of all my filth and my two-year-old,

04:56.880 --> 05:03.040
as she is what to do, just sort of barges in and because she wanted me to do something,

05:03.040 --> 05:06.720
I don't know what it was, probably to do something to one of her dolls,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.680
like wrap it up in toilet paper or throw it into the toilet.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.520
Could she not do that last one? From what I understand,

05:13.520 --> 05:18.560
toddlers excel at throwing things into toilets. Yeah, but if I do it, she can't get in trouble.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.640
So she barges in- And you and I both know

05:20.640 --> 05:25.200
Cooper likes making people do things, but like she has her whims

05:25.200 --> 05:32.160
and she likes them to be acknowledged. So she barges in and while I'm mid-shower,

05:32.160 --> 05:34.800
I'm just wrapping up. Where are you at in this point?

05:34.800 --> 05:37.840
In the shower? Yeah, what stage of the process?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.480
I'm rinsed, I'm ready to go. The shower's over, basically.

05:42.400 --> 05:50.720
She barges in and I am, of course, caught unawares and I rush to turn the water off

05:50.720 --> 05:55.600
so I can reach out and grab a towel, but in the way that little children want to do,

05:55.600 --> 05:59.360
she was already taking notice of my privates and started scowling at them

05:59.360 --> 06:01.600
and pointing in a very angry way as if to say,

06:01.600 --> 06:06.720
what do you do with those and why do you have those? And so I cover myself up

06:06.720 --> 06:12.720
and I go to see with the towel and before I could say anything,

06:14.240 --> 06:21.520
she points at my now covered crotch and says, Daddy, I'm sorry about your little jumble.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.880
Oh, great. How would she know

06:28.880 --> 06:36.160
the worst imaginable thing to say? Every word of that is the sickest burn I've ever heard.

06:36.160 --> 06:42.000
I'm sorry is not what you want to hear about your little, I don't know, jumble?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.800
Jumble suggests that there's things where they ought not be.

06:47.440 --> 06:55.040
Which, from her perspective, all right, fair. But she said sorry about your little jumble.

06:55.040 --> 07:04.400
And then she went on to inquire more and I said, no, it's 6.15 in the morning.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.000
I'm not doing this with you. We're not doing this. I'll put the doll in the toilet. You win.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.280
But we're not talking about my little jumble. Sorry about your little jumble.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.720
Real quick, I just wanted to say like-

07:20.720 --> 07:24.640
Yet another interruption before the show can begin.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.600
Well, I just know like this year is pretty different for people.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.840
And this Candle Nights, people aren't traveling as much.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.680
Not sad, not sad libs, right?

07:31.680 --> 07:35.760
No, it's been a rough year for everybody. And, you know, people are like, what can we do at home?

07:35.760 --> 07:39.360
We had a lot of questions about what kind of traditions they could do at home.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.080
And so I thought maybe we could play along at home.

07:42.080 --> 07:42.720
All right.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.840
Oh, my gosh.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.960
Dutch Sinterklaas is believed to originate where?

07:49.600 --> 07:50.160
Norway.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.760
Where does he come from to come visit the Dutch?

07:53.760 --> 07:54.400
Heaven.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.240
Dressen?

07:56.720 --> 07:57.520
Iceland.

07:57.520 --> 08:03.360
It is believed he comes from Spain and also believes that he travels with a group of elves

08:03.360 --> 08:06.560
who will take bad children back with them to Spain.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.520
Rad. Oh, God, please. Take me, please. Get down to Barcelona, please.

08:11.520 --> 08:11.920
Korea.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.880
Yeah, wouldn't mind. Take me away. I've been really bad, Mr. Elf.

08:17.440 --> 08:22.320
The first artificial Christmas tree developed in the 19th century in Germany

08:22.320 --> 08:24.800
was made from what material?

08:24.800 --> 08:25.600
Asbestos.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.040
Well, come on.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.080
Human hair.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.920
Cat hair.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.680
It was goose feathers.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.240
Dang!

08:34.240 --> 08:36.800
Died green, but you were in the right realm.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.360
Man. This is so festive.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.280
Associated British Foods.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.320
And funny!

08:43.040 --> 08:48.160
Associated British Foods did a study and found that the average American consumes

08:48.160 --> 08:50.720
how many calories on Christmas day?

08:50.720 --> 08:53.760
Oof. I mean, am I trying to stay in Keto?

08:55.280 --> 08:57.200
Because, uh, 3,500.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.800
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say 2,200.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.960
7,000.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.520
Shut up.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.000
Shush.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.960
No, I mean, shut up.

09:04.960 --> 09:09.440
How do you get that? I mean, uh, I mean, how much, how much calories is in cinnamon rolls?

09:09.440 --> 09:12.160
Because I kind of just eat one of those every half hour.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.200
I mean, you get a pud.

09:13.200 --> 09:13.920
You get a pud.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.960
You get a little bit of pudding.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.920
Oh, I'm going to eat a pudding.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.560
Some custard.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.480
Cream with the pudding?

09:18.480 --> 09:22.080
Oh, I love a custard and cream on the pudding.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.520
There's always a pud.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.960
Um, one more.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.320
With, it's a two parter.

09:27.120 --> 09:35.200
In 1950, the record holder for world's tallest cut Christmas tree was erected in the middle of Seattle.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.360
In feet, how tall was it?

09:37.920 --> 09:45.440
And, for another point, adjusted for inflation, how much would the tree cost in the year 2020?

09:45.440 --> 09:49.760
I'm more envious than those uncut trees.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.760
You know how I do it?

09:51.760 --> 09:56.000
It's more natural if you know what I'm saying.

09:56.720 --> 10:02.320
I'll say, here's, and here's a problem that I feel like we are put up against from time

10:02.320 --> 10:09.600
and time on this show, which is my complete lack of sort of spatial imagination.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.880
Because the first thing that came to mind, like I wanted to say like 1500 feet,

10:14.880 --> 10:20.560
but then I was like, no, that would be 150 stories.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.520
Here, I'm going to say, I'm going to say 225 feet.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.800
I'm going to say, I'm going to say 690 feet.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.920
Is that still a lot?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.280
It still feels like a lot.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.440
I'm going to give that point to Justin because it was 221 feet.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.880
No, give the point to Justin.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.240
I was four feet off.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.360
Yeah, but you weren't right.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.320
Crescent over here.

10:41.120 --> 10:41.600
Still wrong.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.720
If you kicked a field goal that was four feet to the left,

10:44.720 --> 10:47.200
the referee wouldn't be like, I'll give it to you.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.400
What if it was, but unless it was near the right post, in which case,

10:51.760 --> 10:52.640
it'd be even better.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.160
So the price.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.040
The price in 2020 dollars.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.000
When was the tree built?

10:58.560 --> 11:00.240
This was 1950.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.120
1950?

11:01.680 --> 11:03.280
But we're adjusting for inflation now.

11:03.840 --> 11:08.320
I'm going to give it a rate of, which is pretty typical for home cut trees.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.440
Heard this on Planet Money.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.400
It's like 10 bucks per feet.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.960
So I'm going to put it at $2,210.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.160
I'm going to say $750,000.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.240
Wow.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.240
You were both wildly incorrect.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.400
It was $185,000.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.000
Wow.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.280
At the time, it was like $19,000, but all right.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.920
Yeah, I say give that one to him so we can move on.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.040
Okay, it's tied.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.080
One, one.

11:36.080 --> 11:36.960
All right.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.560
Okay, but that was the last one, right?

11:38.560 --> 11:42.800
Well, I guess the time breaker will be, who's been the best boy this year?

11:42.800 --> 11:43.360
I mean, not me.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.560
I'm trying to get to Spain.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.360
I've been real dirty.

11:45.360 --> 11:45.920
That's true.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.640
All right, Justin wins because Justin was the best boy this year.

11:48.640 --> 11:48.960
Yeah.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.400
This is an advice show.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.920
I burned down a Whole Foods.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
Stole a cab.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.240
Did take an Uber.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.200
Drove into a river.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.560
Smashed it all up.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.520
The Uber drove into the river.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.020
Yep.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.640
After burning down the Whole Foods?

12:04.640 --> 12:05.920
Yeah, it was on my way back home.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.360
His car was in the Whole Foods.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.200
He drove his car into the Whole Foods, burned the Whole Foods down, didn't have a ride home.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.160
It was embarrassing.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.880
Called an Uber, took an Uber, drove it into the river.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.960
Well, I asked the driver to please drive it into the river, and I was very convincing.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.280
Yeah, it was a fun day.

12:23.280 --> 12:30.160
I did want to, we didn't have a traditional candlelight live show performance.

12:30.160 --> 12:36.000
We did have our Sawbones Christmas special that's part of the video.

12:36.560 --> 12:41.040
But I did want to just tell you guys about a lifetime Christmas movie I watched last night.

12:41.040 --> 12:41.440
Okay.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.320
If I have a moment.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.400
Because it was called Dear Christmas, and I thought it would really speak to you guys

12:46.400 --> 12:48.240
because it is about a podcaster.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.040
Ooh, all right.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.360
So they really got into our territory.

12:51.360 --> 12:59.120
Melissa Joan Hart is up in the mix, and she is the best podcaster.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.080
Now, what do I mean by that?

13:00.080 --> 13:05.920
How can you, she has, her show is the number one podcast in America.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.400
Oh, wait, why, what rating?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.920
Well, Trevor, that's never specified, but it's the number one.

13:11.920 --> 13:16.880
It's on the Earmuffs Network, and it's the number one podcast in America, guys.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.760
And here's what it is.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.480
It's called Holiday Love.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.040
Oh, boy.

13:21.040 --> 13:27.680
And in each episode of the number one podcast in America, she, it's called like Dear,

13:27.680 --> 13:30.560
and then inputs the holiday there.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.160
So it's like Dear Halloween.

13:32.160 --> 13:37.280
And then it's about like real love stories from that holiday, right?

13:37.280 --> 13:37.840
Oh, boy.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.240
Okay.

13:39.120 --> 13:45.920
Okay, but so this, so in this movie, Dear Christmas, she is doing, people keep asking,

13:45.920 --> 13:47.360
so what's the next episode about?

13:47.920 --> 13:50.240
She's like, well, Christmas.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.920
And in my head, I'm thinking, this is the number one podcast.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.560
It's called Holiday Love, and you are just now hitting Christmas.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.200
So I don't believe there's like a Dear Arbor Day.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.920
Me and him both love trees, and we were like, let's do it.

14:03.920 --> 14:12.160
I mean, it definitely means that roundabout, let's say March to like July, real dry spell

14:12.160 --> 14:15.840
in there, real stretching for material.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.960
I love my dad, and he loves her dad, so whatever.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.280
We're in love.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.640
That's the whole bit.

14:22.640 --> 14:28.800
Okay, but the thing about this movie is that makes it really special, besides the fact

14:28.800 --> 14:37.760
that her love interest, played by Jason Priestley, his name is, well, I should tell you first

14:37.760 --> 14:41.120
off, he's a volunteer firefighter and an amateur glass blower.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.200
Those two should cancel each other out, by the way.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.560
And an accomplished baker, and at the firehouse, they make the best fried chicken in town.

14:50.560 --> 14:55.920
And also, he hangs Christmas lights and decorations on the side.

14:55.920 --> 15:01.600
So this is a lot of side jobs that he does, and his name is Chris Massey.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.720
That rolls.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.200
He would call him Mr. Christmas, which would have been a better name for the movie than

15:11.200 --> 15:11.680
Dear Christmas.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.680
So Melissa Genhart and Jason Priestley.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.440
They should have just called the movie, is that Jason Priestley?

15:17.440 --> 15:18.400
Is that Jason Priestley?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.080
I think that's Jason Priestley.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.120
He's 51 years old.

15:21.120 --> 15:21.840
He looks great.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.840
Okay, the weird thing about this movie-

15:25.840 --> 15:27.520
Hey, what's his, Justin?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.200
What's his core job?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.360
He's a volunteer firefighter and amateur-

15:31.360 --> 15:35.360
He does all the side gigs to support his glass blowing, which is germane to what I'm about

15:35.360 --> 15:35.840
to talk to you about.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.080
Okay.

15:37.520 --> 15:44.320
The thing that is fascinating about this film is its relationship to the ongoing COVID-19

15:44.320 --> 15:45.520
pandemic.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.160
Which is, it's an interesting relationship.

15:48.160 --> 15:55.040
So he makes these little, he blows these little glass hearts and puts them up all around town,

15:55.040 --> 15:57.760
and it's a way to thank our first responders, right?

15:57.760 --> 16:01.360
And his sister is an ICU nurse in New York, right?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.840
So it is happening.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.640
We can appreciate this, right?

16:06.640 --> 16:09.520
I just want to say real quick, because I had a very loud sigh there.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.080
If you're trying to make a living as a glass blower, hanging up your product for free around

16:14.080 --> 16:15.520
town is not the way to do it.

16:15.520 --> 16:21.200
He might, no, he does the other jobs to support the glass blowing.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.280
But he's doing it gratis?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.320
He is not attempting-

16:24.320 --> 16:24.960
It's art.

16:24.960 --> 16:25.760
It doesn't matter.

16:25.760 --> 16:30.560
Listen, so the interesting thing about this is, so that is happening.

16:30.560 --> 16:37.920
But also in this film, in like the first five minutes of this film, her boss at earmuffs

16:37.920 --> 16:40.400
is like, are you coming to the holiday party or not?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.080
And it's like, okay, so what?

16:42.080 --> 16:42.720
Sorry?

16:42.720 --> 16:43.920
We're having a holiday party?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.400
We're in the same universe, right?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.000
Okay, that's fine.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.880
And then later in the movie, there is a ugly Christmas sweater party full of people, but

16:54.880 --> 16:57.520
they're just on the outside of it doing something else.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.560
All right.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.280
Yeah.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.960
And they don't actually talk about, you don't see it.

17:02.960 --> 17:08.080
And then later there's a fireman's ball that she shows up too late to.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.160
So it's just her and Jason Priestley.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.880
And that is the thing I wanted to talk to you about, really, is that this movie really

17:14.880 --> 17:21.120
is, it was filmed during, it's not just set in a world that is sort of doing the COVID

17:21.120 --> 17:23.600
thing, but not really doing the COVID thing.

17:24.160 --> 17:29.280
It's also filmed in a world that definitely does have the COVID thing going on.

17:29.280 --> 17:36.640
As such, Jason Priestley, Melissa Joan Hart, Ed Begley Jr.

17:36.640 --> 17:47.200
as her dad, Faith Prince as her mom, two other, her sister and her boss, end of cast in movie.

17:47.920 --> 17:55.520
There are six people in this movie, which you don't really notice until like they're

17:55.520 --> 18:01.840
having, they're at like a restaurant and they're the only ones there because they can only

18:01.840 --> 18:06.480
get, I guess, enough COVID tests for these two and nobody else.

18:06.480 --> 18:10.720
So every once in a while, you'll see someone 30 feet in the distance, just sort of walking

18:10.720 --> 18:11.760
through the shot.

18:11.760 --> 18:17.120
But there are no extras, no zany neighbor.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.720
There's no zany neighbor.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.200
There's no waitress at the restaurant.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.360
They're like getting their own drinks.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.440
And it's this in the wild thing is she doesn't hate Christmas.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.240
So if you know anything about these movies, that's the thing that has to be overcome.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.320
They both like Christmas fine.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.120
So there's no movie either.

18:37.120 --> 18:41.840
It's literally, I said it's literally Melissa Joan Hart to Ed Begley Jr.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.000
just shouting about how much they love candy canes.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.440
It's like waiting for a good toe.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.800
It's madness.

18:46.800 --> 18:52.080
Justin, is it possible that there's a deeper underlying thing going on here in which the

18:52.080 --> 18:57.360
six of them are not just the only people in this movie, but in this movie, the only people

18:57.360 --> 18:58.640
left on Earth?

19:01.680 --> 19:07.520
Well, no, because there is a brother.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.320
The sister, her job is that she's pregnant.

19:11.600 --> 19:16.640
And the other job she has is her husband got stuck in like traffic or something.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.960
So he hasn't been able to come to where she's about to have a baby.

19:20.960 --> 19:26.400
She does eventually have a baby, and it is 100% a plastic doll that is completely, obviously

19:26.400 --> 19:31.680
a plastic doll and really ratchets up the full blown panic attack that this film is

19:31.680 --> 19:36.400
where they're just passing around this beautiful plastic baby and making Google ads at it.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.000
But he makes it just in time.

19:40.800 --> 19:46.320
But he doesn't talk because I guess maybe it's particles.

19:46.320 --> 19:52.960
Maybe it's somebody just not wanting to give him his after card because I'm pretty sure

19:52.960 --> 19:54.560
he's the cinematographer.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.640
I was looking at pictures trying to figure it out.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.840
I'm pretty sure the cinematographer doesn't say anything when he finally makes it.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.680
Doesn't say anything to his plastic baby.

20:01.680 --> 20:04.400
Just falls asleep and he's asleep on the couch.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.440
He stumbles in with suitcases, lays them down, lays on the couch, goes to sleep for the rest

20:09.440 --> 20:11.120
of the film, does all the speak.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.800
Can I ask you guys something that's really twisted my noodle?

20:14.800 --> 20:15.280
Sure.

20:15.280 --> 20:15.920
Yeah, sure.

20:15.920 --> 20:20.320
And it's something I've never thought about before, but only now this movie is making

20:20.320 --> 20:20.880
me question.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.440
Do volunteer firefighters get paid?

20:25.440 --> 20:28.160
I think they're just in it for the love of the game.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.400
Travis, they just hate fire so much.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.560
They hate fire more than anything else at all.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.680
It just seems like a really hard job to do.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.160
For sure.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.080
For no money.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.400
So is fighting the Joker, but you don't hear Batman complain.

20:40.400 --> 20:40.800
That's true.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.200
Does that for free.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.560
Batman doesn't get paid?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.080
We're not cutting Batman a check, no.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.920
No, somebody should.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.920
You think Commissioner Gordon's got him on the payroll?

20:47.920 --> 20:49.680
That would sort of go against the whole thing, huh?

20:49.680 --> 20:51.760
No, I just assumed it was the mayor.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.520
He gets advertisements.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.120
That's why he has like, you know.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.400
Oh, endorsements.

20:56.400 --> 21:02.080
Yeah, he's got on his cape, he's got like the thing for Razer keyboards and a lot of

21:02.080 --> 21:03.120
gaming chairs.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.320
A lot of gamer fuel.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.200
A lot of gamer fuel.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.440
Do we want to try and sneak in a quick question before the break or?

21:09.440 --> 21:11.200
Just one quick, quick.

21:11.200 --> 21:11.440
Yeah.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.240
One quick quick.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.280
Quick question.

21:13.280 --> 21:18.000
I bought my little brother his favorite candy online as a stocking stuffer, but accidentally

21:18.000 --> 21:19.520
made it a bulk order.

21:19.520 --> 21:24.480
I now have enough boxes of Swedish Fish to open my own old timey candy shop, and I can't

21:24.480 --> 21:26.000
decide what's the best way to give him his candy.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.680
If there was a candy shop in my town that only sold Swedish Fish, I'd be so gized about

21:31.680 --> 21:32.400
that.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.880
Yeah, they have lots of different colors and shapes and sizes now.

21:34.880 --> 21:41.280
Anyway, should I stuff his stocking to the brim, wrap them all up in a giant box, trim

21:41.280 --> 21:43.200
the tree with them?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.800
Any ideas are appreciated.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.360
Happy candle nights, candy conundrum in California.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.720
And what can I just say?

21:48.720 --> 21:49.920
What a lovely problem to have.

21:49.920 --> 21:50.240
Yeah.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.200
Too many Swedish Fish.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.920
Oh, now I need to Google shelf life of Swedish Fish.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.600
Oh, forever.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.960
There's, there's, yeah, they keep, man, this astronaut.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.720
And I think they get better, honestly.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.840
Like less fresh.

22:03.840 --> 22:08.560
When they get that crust on it, like you got a kind of, yeah, I like that, I like that.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.720
They do not spoil easily.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.000
Yeah, absolutely.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.400
Okay.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.680
The problem is box candy.

22:15.680 --> 22:19.920
Candy in boxes is not great stocking stuffer material.

22:19.920 --> 22:20.400
You know what I mean?

22:20.400 --> 22:23.280
Because it's not an efficient use of stocking space.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.400
You got to have a candy that can get down in the toes, fam.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.000
That's why the chocolate orange is such a classic.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.120
Perfect, perfect.

22:31.120 --> 22:31.520
It's perfect.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.840
By the way, weirdly sold out everywhere.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.480
Chocolate orange?

22:34.480 --> 22:36.320
Cannot find a chocolate, cannot get a beat.

22:36.320 --> 22:42.000
I think I'm, folks, I may have to go to Cracker Barrel and I don't want to.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.200
I've made a promise and I keep my promises.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.880
But Swedish Fish, you're going to have to grip it, rip it and tip it into the stocking

22:48.880 --> 22:52.880
so that it's just loose fishies in there.

22:52.880 --> 22:53.920
Here's what you could do.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.120
I think this would be fun.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.480
This is a legit suggestion.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.800
I want to preface that because sometimes it's hard to tell.

22:59.520 --> 23:05.760
Every day, slap a stamp and an address on one of those boxes, drop it in the mail.

23:05.760 --> 23:11.680
And eventually what will happen is every day your brother will receive one box of Swedish

23:11.680 --> 23:12.560
Fish in the mail.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.440
So good.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.160
That's so good.

23:14.800 --> 23:19.440
Better yet, when you're putting in the address, put mine in maybe sometimes.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.200
That's fine.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.240
Here's an idea.

23:22.240 --> 23:28.160
Maybe your brother, you start doing this and then he starts not thanking you or stops thanking

23:28.160 --> 23:30.720
you as a normal person would say it.

23:30.720 --> 23:36.560
And when he gets sort of like that, to teach him a lesson, send it to me because I will

23:36.560 --> 23:38.080
enjoy it quite a bit.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.480
I won't thank you like your brother does, but I will still eat it and you'll know that.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.280
The problem with Travis's idea is-

23:45.280 --> 23:46.480
Oh, please.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.360
There's a small one.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.560
Is that, let's say 12 packages, right?

23:50.560 --> 23:52.160
That's probably what we're talking about here.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.480
I'm looking at the bulk assortment on Amazon.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.760
It looks like 12 packages.

23:55.760 --> 24:03.440
So you get 12, he gets a fresh, delicious bag of Swedish Fish maybe once per week.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.800
And then week 13, his mouth starts watering.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.960
Oh, cherry.

24:08.960 --> 24:09.840
Yellow.

24:09.840 --> 24:13.200
And then he opens it and the bag's not there.

24:13.680 --> 24:18.560
And then he has to start wondering, like, what did I do wrong?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.480
Why did I- I've been enjoying every delicious fish-

24:22.480 --> 24:23.520
I was a good boy this week.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.560
I want my candy.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.920
I want my candy.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.960
I shared them.

24:26.960 --> 24:32.080
I think that's worst- that's best case scenario, Justin, because worst case scenario is then

24:32.080 --> 24:38.480
he gets that Swedish Fish hunger and he's out there, you know, like ripping up mailboxes

24:38.480 --> 24:43.520
trying to find where his Swedish Fish went and it just becomes a real mess.

24:43.520 --> 24:47.360
You got to trank him, you know, until the madness passes.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.240
Or you get some more.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.480
Or yeah, or you just, I guess, keep buying them.

24:52.480 --> 24:57.280
I just feel like if you do this for 12 weeks, then you have to do it for at least, like,

24:57.280 --> 24:58.160
the rest of the year.

24:58.880 --> 25:04.000
Or it's like six- it's like when you have to pick the duration of a gift subscription,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.120
which is always the worst.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.640
It's like, I thought you might want this for three months and then not want it again.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.600
So that's what I went with.

25:09.600 --> 25:14.320
I might suggest, though, again, just to circle back to sending me some of your great candy,

25:14.320 --> 25:19.840
that I think eating 12 boxes of Swedish Fish would make your brother pretty sick, even

25:19.840 --> 25:21.920
if spaced out over a long period of time.

25:21.920 --> 25:27.360
You're going to gum up the works so hard in there that he will become more gummy than

25:27.360 --> 25:28.640
man at that point.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.520
Then alternate between Swedish Fish and Metamucil.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.680
Okay, just to clear out, just to make room for more Swedish Fish.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.400
Just to keep the aisles clear, you know?

25:38.400 --> 25:44.080
Maybe you dust the Swedish Fish with Metamucil, like it's the acid powder that they put on

25:44.080 --> 25:44.800
Sour Patch Kids.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.360
That's fun.

25:45.360 --> 25:45.840
There you go.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.560
Oh, what do Swedish Fish like to swim in?

25:48.560 --> 25:50.880
Oh, that's a big drink of Metamucil, my friend.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.480
Yeah.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.920
And it'll treat your body like one of those tubes that they blast the salmon out of.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.040
I have always...

26:01.040 --> 26:03.440
I have very little interest in marine life.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.640
I have always wanted to blast one of those salmon cannons.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.040
Yeah.

26:07.040 --> 26:07.680
You've seen those?

26:07.680 --> 26:10.320
It's like, oh, we'll help you get up this waterfall of salmons.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.440
Here's your salmon blaster.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.200
And it's like, well, first of all, that's cheating.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.840
But also, it looks like a lot of fun.

26:17.840 --> 26:22.400
And I would love to just really launch these boys.

26:22.400 --> 26:26.880
Now I just want to go down a deep rabbit hole of YouTube watching videos of that, Griffin.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.080
Of salmon blasters?

26:28.080 --> 26:28.800
Yeah, let's do that.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.040
We'll do that together while Justin does the ads by himself.

26:31.040 --> 26:31.280
Okay.

26:32.400 --> 26:32.960
Fantastic.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.200
Well, let's go to the money zone.

26:35.200 --> 26:48.160
I googled salmon blasters.

26:48.160 --> 26:48.960
Oh, boy.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.000
That's not anything.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.720
It does kind of sound like a new, like, appetizer at TGI Fridays.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.040
Yeah.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.440
Listen, this is perfect.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.960
If you are planning on mailing any of your siblings

27:00.960 --> 27:08.560
a piecemeal bulk order of Swedish fish, there is only one place that is going to let you do that

27:08.560 --> 27:12.560
from the comfort of your own home, and that's stamps.com.

27:12.560 --> 27:17.600
Last minute holiday gifts or holiday gifts that will go throughout January and February

27:17.600 --> 27:20.960
and some of March that are fish shaped and cherry flavored.

27:20.960 --> 27:25.280
Well, the post office is a little busy.

27:25.280 --> 27:29.040
And, you know, with the ongoing unpleasantness, maybe not the best place to go hang out.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.720
But you can do all the post office stuff from your house.

27:32.720 --> 27:39.760

27:39.760 --> 27:45.920
You can send out invoices to big warehouses, send out lots of packages every day,

27:45.920 --> 27:51.440
or maybe smaller operations that's more focused on transporting Swedish fish around this great country.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.920

27:53.920 --> 27:57.040

We'll know. We'll know if you do.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.040
We'll know. They track your phone.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.480
To celebrate the holidays, you guys, I have a new invention.

28:40.480 --> 28:40.880
Okay.

28:40.880 --> 28:41.280
What's that?

28:41.280 --> 28:42.640
I call it red apron.

28:43.600 --> 28:50.400
And with red apron, you get, it's kind of a loose, really thin material plastic bag

28:50.400 --> 28:56.160
full of just a random assortment of ingredients that don't really go together.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.760
No clear instructions.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.320
There's like snippets of instructions that I've included in there.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.280
And oh, and I should be clear.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.480
All the food is room temperature or worse.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.440
Okay, worse.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.400
And you get that at random times.

29:10.400 --> 29:15.280
There's really no way to predict when it will come, what will be in it.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.440
Sometimes you'll get two boxes on the same day and then not get another box for the next month and a half.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.800
Right, but you'll still get charged.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.440
Let's be clear, you'll still get charged at regular intervals.

29:24.640 --> 29:32.160
And it's just kind of my, it's a dinner innovation, as I like to call it, a denovation.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.040
What do you think?

29:33.040 --> 29:33.840
I'm sorry, y'all.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.760
I've been watching the salmon cannon video for the last four minutes and it's entrancing.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.760
Can you imagine if a big giant man picked up your body and shoved it into a white tube

29:41.760 --> 29:47.120
and then all of a sudden you were in Illinois and you were like, thanks, giant human-like being?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.400
Well, then let's put it this way.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.480
Blue Apron is like a salmon cannon for ingredients to your door.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.040
Exactly.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.800
Including, but not limited to.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.680
Salmon.

29:55.680 --> 29:56.480
Salmon, yeah.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.200
You blast a bunch of salmon out of a can.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.760
Maybe you want a nice little caper sauce with those.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.680
Yep, they blast that too.

30:03.680 --> 30:08.560
Yeah, it's a series of salmon tubes that run all over this beautiful country of ours

30:08.560 --> 30:13.600
and you get it and you make a tasty home-cooked meal and they're really good.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.480
And they come with super clear recipes that are easy to follow.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.800
And yeah, they also have meal prep options now, which allows you to cook one time

30:20.800 --> 30:24.800
and get eight servings of food that can all be prepared in under two hours

30:24.800 --> 30:27.600
using one streamlined set of steps.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.960
That sounds pretty convenient, if you ask me.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.360
Don't miss out on all that Blue Apron has to offer this season.

30:33.360 --> 30:37.120
See what's on this week's menu and get $30 off across your first two deliveries

30:37.120 --> 30:39.760
when you visit blueapron.com slash my brother.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.240
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.520
Okay, here's my new invention.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.400
Blue Apron.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.960
Never go to the post office again.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.000
Here's my new invention.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.720
It's a salmon cannon that as the salmon passes through the cannon,

30:52.720 --> 30:58.480
it gets slowly roasted until it arrives at your door fully cooked and seasoned.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.480
And then it lands right in your ears and you're like,

31:02.480 --> 31:04.480
I cannot hear my music with these.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.440
And someone's like, why are you putting cooked salmon in there?

31:07.440 --> 31:09.440
You should be using Raycon.

31:09.440 --> 31:14.880
Okay, I mean, I guess that's not really great for my pitch for Shark Tank, Justin,

31:14.880 --> 31:15.520
but I guess...

31:15.520 --> 31:16.000
No.

31:16.000 --> 31:16.320
Okay.

31:17.040 --> 31:22.640
Well, Raycon, if you want to get a gift and for somebody it's hard to shop for,

31:22.640 --> 31:29.600
there's one that so many people would love to have and use and they're wireless earbuds.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.240
And Raycon makes a great pair.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.840
I've got a pair that I use.

31:33.840 --> 31:37.920
They are my, like around the house, the kids are maybe still asleep

31:37.920 --> 31:39.760
and I want to pop in a podcast or music.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.360
Or the kids are talking about your jumble.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.760
Okay, they fit my wife's weird, shameful ears,

31:46.320 --> 31:49.520
which is a real feather in their proverbial cap.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.520
They're great earbuds and you're not going to...

31:53.600 --> 31:58.160
It's comparable quality to what you get from the other premium brands,

31:58.160 --> 32:00.720
but Raycon started at half the price.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.280
So that makes them a great gift in my book.

32:04.080 --> 32:07.200
You can use them for calls, music, for work, for play, home,

32:07.200 --> 32:08.080
or on the go.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.400
It's a gift that keeps on giving.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.600
Griffin, let's say I wanted to get a pair.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.240
How would I do it?

32:14.240 --> 32:18.320
Well, you can get a pair and you can also get them for 15% off.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.120
If you go to buy...

32:19.120 --> 32:19.680
What?

32:19.680 --> 32:20.000
Yeah.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.040
Griffin knows the guy.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.200
Yeah, I know Ray.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.320
And so go to buyraycon.com slash my brother

32:26.320 --> 32:28.640
and you're going to get 15% off your Raycon order.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.040
That's buyraycon.com slash my brother.

32:31.840 --> 32:36.240
Just one more time for good measure, buyraycon.com slash my brother.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.800
And while you're there, if you need tires or a stereo or like,

32:40.800 --> 32:43.120
I don't know, a new jacket, you let Ray know.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.480
Just ask Ray.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.200
Just ask Ray.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.240
He'll take care of you.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.800
But whatever you do, do not go to the post office.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.160
Don't go in the post office.

32:50.160 --> 32:50.880
Ray will know.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.840
Hi, I'm Jo Firestone.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.440
And I'm Manolo Moreno.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.800
And we host After Game Show, a podcast where listeners submit games

32:58.800 --> 33:03.040
and we play them regardless of quality with a dozen listeners from around the world.

33:03.040 --> 33:08.320
We've had folks call in from as far as Sweden, South Africa, and the Philippines.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.240
Here's an example.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.040
This is the game we called Zooey Deschanel,

33:13.040 --> 33:16.000
where you turn a celebrity's name into an animal pun.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.440
You have an example, Manolo?

33:17.440 --> 33:18.560
Brad Gorilla Pit.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.520
Oh, that's a pun on Gorilla Pit?

33:21.520 --> 33:21.760
Yep.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.440
I don't know.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.560
That's Brad Pit.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.440
Oh, okay.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.240
That's a high quality game that you could expect.

33:28.240 --> 33:33.280
After Game Show has new episodes every other Wednesday on Maximum Fun.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.480
Check us out, please.

33:37.120 --> 33:38.000
How about a yahoo?

33:38.640 --> 33:38.880
Yes.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.320
Yeah, I love that.

33:40.320 --> 33:40.560
Okay.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.680
Are you going to interrupt me with a bit?

33:42.640 --> 33:42.880
Okay.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.000
I'm not.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.440
I'll miss the most sacred of days.

33:45.440 --> 33:45.680
Sure.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.600
I'm just saying if you were sucked up into a human-sized salmon cannon,

33:49.600 --> 33:51.360
wouldn't you just be like, oh, I'm dead?

33:51.360 --> 33:55.200
Like before you even got to the other end, you'd be like, now this is your own interruption.

33:55.200 --> 33:55.440
Okay.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.160
But that assumes that the salmon is aware of what's happening, Griffin.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.360
Absolutely, they are not.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.480
Absolutely, they are not.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.920
Brian sent this one in.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.960
Thank you, Brian.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.160
It's from yahoo answers user Daddy Bear1964.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.920
Who asks, how do you start a new city or town in Texas?

34:12.560 --> 34:15.120
Would like to have the area where I live become a city.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.200
What a city to have.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.800
I have wondered about this for a good long time.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.160
Yeah, gotta have.

34:22.160 --> 34:26.240
Because there used to be a time in this great land of ours

34:26.240 --> 34:31.840
where you just walk into a big empty space and you're like, all right, this is Traveston now.

34:31.840 --> 34:32.720
This looks like a city.

34:32.720 --> 34:32.960
Yep.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.840
Colisepe Huntington did it, thank God.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.120
Walked into, I don't know, Holderby Landing, correct?

34:39.120 --> 34:41.200
It's like, hey, this place sucks.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.080
I want to build a train right through the middle of this pit

34:44.080 --> 34:47.920
and you're all going to love me for it and I'm going to call it Huntington after me.

34:47.920 --> 34:54.400
Cities have mayor, city hall.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.280
Mayor, that's you.

34:55.280 --> 34:55.600
Yes.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.160
I think if you start the town, you got to be the first mayor.

34:58.160 --> 34:58.640
That's it.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.720
Hey everybody, welcome to Coolville.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.800
Order number one, I'm the mayor.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.080
Order number two, we got to get a Chili's up in here.

35:06.800 --> 35:07.360
Yeah.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.600
Does anyone know how to start a Chili's franchise?

35:09.600 --> 35:11.760
Because that's going to put Cooltown on the map.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.600
Did I say Cooltown or Coolville?

35:13.600 --> 35:14.160
I forgot.

35:14.160 --> 35:22.640
I forgot how long you have to have an area that is separate from other town, right?

35:24.080 --> 35:26.720
Real city will not take kindly to you sort of annexing.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.240
Making a middle city in the city.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.440
You know what I did?

35:29.440 --> 35:29.680
What?

35:30.400 --> 35:32.560
It's been long enough now that I think I can reveal this.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.920
I started my own city here in the middle of Cincinnati,

35:35.920 --> 35:38.800
but what I did was my city is also called Cincinnati,

35:38.800 --> 35:41.200
but with one extra N in there and I won't tell you where.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.080
Oh no.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.640
And so like nobody knows yet.

35:44.640 --> 35:49.600
And I've been slowly pushing the fence one inch every year.

35:49.600 --> 35:55.280
Yeah, and Travis also has his own like pirate bootleg version of Babes in Toyland

35:55.280 --> 36:13.840
where they sing I come from C-I-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-A-T-I, Cincinnati.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.920
It's loose dry beans.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.880
I call it the Chili that crunches.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.840
It's Travis's crunchy garbanzo surprise.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.640
Welcome to Cincinnati.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.440
That's not where the inn is, Griffin.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.440
You'll never guess.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.440
And you wouldn't tell me if you got it right.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.440
No, I wouldn't tell you, because that's how they get you.

36:34.440 --> 36:47.440
If my town had an army, I feel like that would help me be respected by nearby towns that maybe wouldn't recognize my sovereignty.

36:47.440 --> 36:54.440
Justin's making a joke point that many a militia has actually made in this terrible world of ours that-

36:54.440 --> 36:57.440
All right, now that I've backed into it myself, I can see the logic.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.440
I'm sorry I've been so hard on militias.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.440
Thank you for defending us from the government.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.440
You're all doing a great job.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.440
Now, let me say this.

37:06.440 --> 37:12.440
Speaking of government, I think if your city immediately starts paying taxes to the government,

37:12.440 --> 37:16.440
the federal government probably isn't going to do anything to stop-

37:16.440 --> 37:19.440
The city that you are annexing from is going to be like,

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
hey, government, do something.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.440
And they're like, we recognize it.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.440
They're giving us money, and you're giving us money.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.440
It's win-win.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.440
It's double money.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.440
That's a good point, Trav.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
How big's the city got to be?

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
Big enough for a Chili's and a Town Hall.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.440
You start with a Hamlet.

37:34.440 --> 37:38.440
You got to start with a Hamlet, and then you're a township.

37:38.440 --> 37:44.440
Then you're a town, and then you're a townburg, and then you're a burg city.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.440
And then you're a city.

37:47.440 --> 37:52.440
Then you're a metropolis, and then you're a super metropolis.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.440
Right.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.440
And then-

37:54.440 --> 37:55.440
It's a kingdom.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.440
I think kingdom comes after that.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
Yep.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
That's right.

37:59.440 --> 38:03.440
How are we going to get statehood, though, for my cool city that's just a Town Hall and Chili's,

38:03.440 --> 38:06.440
so that we can get two senators there?

38:06.440 --> 38:07.440
Hmm.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.440
This is a good question.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.440
I think we can really-

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
I think first you need a professional sports team.

38:11.440 --> 38:16.440
Everybody's always fighting about the Senate, and we got to take it, and we absolutely do need to take it,

38:16.440 --> 38:21.440
but gosh, that would be easier if Chili's Town could just put up two more.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.440
And let's say Chili's Town is also the most progressive city on the map.

38:24.440 --> 38:31.440
San Francisco seems like a very conservative city compared to Chili's Town.

38:31.440 --> 38:39.440
Could you get your city sponsored by Chili's and have them get you statehood?

38:39.440 --> 38:42.440
I bet someone at Chili's knows a guy.

38:42.440 --> 38:47.440
I'm just saying, everyone eats at Chili's, probably including the Supreme Court justices.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.440
Yes.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.440
You could probably make this happen.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.440
Yeah.

38:50.440 --> 38:54.440
It's like how NBA players eat at Cheesecake Factory so much when they're on the road,

38:54.440 --> 38:57.440
because they just know that Cheesecake Factory's going to- this is not a joke.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.440
Whenever- it's like a thing.

38:58.440 --> 39:03.440
NBA players just like, when they're going to a city and they don't know what the food's like at that city,

39:03.440 --> 39:07.440
they're like, I know what Cheesecake Factory has, and it's always there.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.440
You're laughing, but that's also what we do.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
Yeah, we have stuff.

39:11.440 --> 39:17.440
I'm laughing out of familiarity because we have stumbled into this exact practice where we're traveling.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.440
I know they're going to have something that everyone will eat because it's Cheesecake Factory.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.440
We have five children, six adults.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.440
Yeah, throw a cheesecake in there.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
You ready for another question?

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
Yeah, sure.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.440
Okay.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.440
Oh, wow.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.440
What a surprise.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.440
I interrupted myself, though.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.440
It's a present to you.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.440
Thank you.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.440
A holiday present.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.440
Welcome to Haunted Doll Watch.

39:36.440 --> 39:49.440
It is a dip into the paranormal where we're going to talk about the hottest, sexiest paranormal items on eBay.

39:49.440 --> 39:55.440
Now, this week is very special, and of course it's special because this is Candle Nights, so...

39:55.440 --> 39:58.440
Ooh, do we have a holiday spirit?

39:58.440 --> 39:59.440
We do, Travis.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.440
We do have a holiday spirit, but you know what we don't have with this one?

40:01.440 --> 40:03.440
What?

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
A doll.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.440
Huh.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.440
Okay.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.440
So that begs the question.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.440
What's the question?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
What's the haunted thing?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
What is it?

40:11.440 --> 40:13.440
What are you talking about?

40:13.440 --> 40:18.440
This is listed as haunted, not doll.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.440
Christmas elf spirit will be sent to you.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.440
New.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.440
Never before seen.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.440
That part, I bet, is very accurate.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.440
Yes.

40:29.440 --> 40:36.440
So it's a spirit of a Christmas elf.

40:36.440 --> 40:37.440
I'm going to send it to you.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
Just wait.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
Sorry.

40:39.440 --> 40:43.440
Just a loose, loose, jingling around in that box spirit?

40:43.440 --> 40:46.440
Christmas elf special mystery spirit will be sent to you.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.440
Mystery spirit.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.440
So it's like a slime bag.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.440
It's like a chase elf.

40:51.440 --> 40:55.440
Ghosts actually hate it when you call them slime bags.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.440
We're not all slimers, okay?

40:57.440 --> 40:58.440
Yeah.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.440
New.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.440
Never before seen.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.440
Very true.

41:01.440 --> 41:05.440
This mystery spirit will travel on his or her own once you submit payment.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.440
Or there.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.440
Come on.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.440
Or there once you submit payment.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.440
Wow.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.440
About this mystery spirit.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.440
These mystery spirits come from many creatures.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.440
Of course, the one we're talking about today is the ghost of a Christmas elf, I guess.

41:19.440 --> 41:25.440
But we sell spirits from ancient unicorns, single-headed dragons, double-headed dragons,

41:25.440 --> 41:27.440
wolves, centaurs, mermaids.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.440
Wow.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.440
Way to just drop wolves in the middle of those.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.440
Yeah.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.440
Like wolves are like, uh, hey.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.440
Hey, Debbie.

41:34.440 --> 41:37.440
You know I'm real, right?

41:37.440 --> 41:41.440
Mermaids, mermen, chickens, giant moths, orcs.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.440
Chickens.

41:42.440 --> 41:43.440
Wait.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.440
Sorry.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.440
Back up.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.440
Sorry.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.440
Did you say chickens?

41:47.440 --> 41:48.440
Was that really in there?

41:48.440 --> 41:49.440
Yeah, bud.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.440
Mermen, chickens, giant moths, orcs, fanguses, griffins.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
Oh, no.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.440
No.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
Fawns.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.440
Niads.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
Centaurs.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.440
Centaurs.

41:58.440 --> 41:59.440
Cyclopses.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.440
And more.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.440
Oh, boy.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.440
I'll take one wolf and eight chickens.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.440
Or is this a grab bag thing?

42:04.440 --> 42:06.440
They can't put them both in the same bag.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.440
Oh, god, no.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.440
And I'll also take a spirit of a bag of grain, please.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
Yes.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.440
Oh, how do I get them across the river?

42:12.440 --> 42:17.440
Upon winning this auction, we will send you a message when mystery spirit will come to

42:17.440 --> 42:19.440
you after you submit your payment.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.440
They can't be more clear about that.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.440
Oh, boy.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.440
Different kinds of spirits travel at different times of days.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.440
But each mystery spirit arrives within 24 hours.

42:28.440 --> 42:33.440
These mystery spirits travel very quickly since they are only in spirit now and are

42:33.440 --> 42:35.440
not weighted down by their bodies.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.440
They do not need to travel in a box.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.440
Thank god.

42:39.440 --> 42:45.440
But since they are in spirit form, they travel to you in spirit on their own.

42:45.440 --> 42:51.440
Hey, seller, I recognize that they don't need to travel in a box, but could they just so

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
I feel like-

42:52.440 --> 42:53.440
Could they just.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.440
What will the kids open?

42:54.440 --> 42:55.440
Just so something is.

42:55.440 --> 43:00.440
And maybe also you could put a little note in there that says definitely a spirit in

43:00.440 --> 43:01.440
here.

43:01.440 --> 43:02.440
Something.

43:02.440 --> 43:04.440
Just put like some smoke in a box.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.440
I don't know if it'll keep, but just something.

43:05.440 --> 43:10.440
I need something to come out of a box or else my kids are going to be pretty ticked off.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
Warning.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.440
These mystery spirits have different personalities.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.440
We cannot guarantee one personality over another one.

43:16.440 --> 43:21.440
However, we will let you know what kind of personality the mystery spirit you buy has

43:21.440 --> 43:23.440
and any other information that would be helpful to you.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.440
Wait, what?

43:24.440 --> 43:25.440
We can't.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.440
Wait.

43:26.440 --> 43:27.440
You're going to buy one.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.440
They can't guarantee a personality, but after they've shipped it, they'll be like, this

43:30.440 --> 43:31.440
is a mean one.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.440
Hang on for the ride of your life.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.440
It's a mean minotaur.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.440
So, uh-oh.

43:36.440 --> 43:43.440
Hey, can I just real quick, I just want to put up some, just a curtain here real quick

43:43.440 --> 43:46.440
and say, this is all made up.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.440
Why don't you guarantee the spirit?

43:48.440 --> 43:51.440
Why don't you say like, they're going to be super nice.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.440
I'll tell you exactly why, Travis.

43:53.440 --> 43:56.440
Pretend that you are this mystical seller and I'm the recipient.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.440
Hi, I want a triple-headed dragon.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.440
Oh, you don't have those?

43:59.440 --> 44:02.440
Then I guess give me two-headed dragon and one-headed dragon at the same time, please.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.440
You got it.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.440
When will they be here?

44:05.440 --> 44:08.440
They'll be here within 24 mystical hours.

44:08.440 --> 44:09.440
Okay.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.440
25 hours later, I'm partying with my ghost dragons and I call you up.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.440
Hey, I didn't get them.

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
Are you sure?

44:16.440 --> 44:17.440
I didn't get them.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.440
I want my money back.

44:18.440 --> 44:19.440
I didn't get them.

44:19.440 --> 44:23.440
I hear a party going on in the background and I know that these were radical dudes.

44:23.440 --> 44:26.440
It's my son's birthday and we got an entertainment dragon.

44:26.440 --> 44:30.440
But I hear him saying I'm partying with a two-headed dragon and a one-headed dragon.

44:30.440 --> 44:37.440
You can send me three more dragon heads arranged on as many bodies as you want or my money back.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.440
I'll just keep sending you dragons.

44:39.440 --> 44:40.440
All right.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.440
25 hours later again.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.440
Hey, where are those dragons?

44:44.440 --> 44:45.440
I sent the dragon.

44:45.440 --> 44:46.440
You didn't get them?

44:46.440 --> 44:49.440
No, but just send me a few centaurs, I guess.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.440
Oh, I'm fresh out.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.440
I'm pretty sure I got my own fantasy ghost menagerie.

44:54.440 --> 45:01.440
How will you know Mystery Spirit has started preparing to travel to you when we send message?

45:01.440 --> 45:04.440
I'll just read it exactly word for word.

45:04.440 --> 45:10.440
You will know your Mystery Spirit has started preparing to travel to you when we send you a message via the eBay messaging system.

45:10.440 --> 45:14.440
Your Mystery Spirit will arrive promptly within the next 24 hours.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.440
Not prompt, by the way.

45:16.440 --> 45:19.440
That flies in the face of the definition of prompt.

45:19.440 --> 45:23.440
Each Mystery Spirit has one or more feelings that come with it.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.440
I can relate to that.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.440
How are you, man?

45:27.440 --> 45:29.440
Happy still.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.440
Yeah.

45:31.440 --> 45:38.440
You will know that your Mystery Spirit has arrived when you sense the feeling that is included in the message that we send you.

45:38.440 --> 45:43.440
This feeling may start small and be hard to identify at first, but it will set in soon.

45:43.440 --> 45:51.440
Because some Mystery Spirits take longer than other to completely move in, and they like to make sure they are welcome.

45:51.440 --> 46:01.440
So make your special Mystery Spirit feel at home, and they will get more comfortable around you, and your feeling of will increase before long.

46:01.440 --> 46:07.440
Finally, this is fascinating to learn, and I really appreciate them sharing this last tidbit.

46:07.440 --> 46:12.440
Most Mystery Spirits like to have the company of other Mystery Spirits, too.

46:12.440 --> 46:19.440
So feel free to come back for more Mystery Spirits if you enjoy what you receive.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.440
Now, I have been dying to know, Justin.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.440
How much?

46:22.440 --> 46:23.440
Ask me anything.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.440
How much?

46:24.440 --> 46:25.440
Okay.

46:25.440 --> 46:26.440
Okay.

46:26.440 --> 46:32.440
Well, God, so much of this is not going to seem real to you.

46:32.440 --> 46:35.440
Well, sir, it's $49.99 each.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.440
All right, all right, all right.

46:37.440 --> 46:41.440
But if you buy two, it's $49.49 each.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.440
Oh, boy, that's a discount.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.440
That's awesome.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.440
You buy three, well, friend, you're getting them for $48.99 a piece.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.440
Wow.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.440
That's a big savings, baby.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.440
Just a quick sidebar.

46:52.440 --> 46:58.440
Do you think in the Pokémon universe there's shady individuals who are like, hey, kid, you want to buy a Gastly?

46:58.440 --> 47:00.440
Yeah, it'll be $20.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.440
Okay, where is it?

47:01.440 --> 47:02.440
It's right here in my hands.

47:02.440 --> 47:03.440
Can't see it?

47:03.440 --> 47:05.440
Yeah, it's a dead person.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.440
There's two more things I wanted to share.

47:08.440 --> 47:23.440
First is that this is sold by a seller named Omar D Zero, and they have gotten a few complaints because they sell mystery boxes, and they don't tell you what's in them.

47:23.440 --> 47:28.440
And then people are leaving reviews that say it's a ripoff.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.440
Huh.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.440
And they say, well, I don't know, it's a mystery.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.440
You solved it, though.

47:34.440 --> 47:41.440
The listing specifically say they're worth more or less than you pay.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.440
I didn't know you could just do that.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.440
Don't buy this.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.440
A flashlight for $25 is the only thing I got.

47:47.440 --> 47:48.440
Ripoff.

47:48.440 --> 47:53.440
And it says, the response from Omar D Zero says, you paid $24.99 for electronics.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.440
Please tell me how a $25 flashlight is a ripoff.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.440
It makes light.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.440
Got them.

47:58.440 --> 47:59.440
That's a miracle.

47:59.440 --> 48:03.440
You travel back in time, you pull out that flashlight, you're a king.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.440
Yeah, you're in charge.

48:05.440 --> 48:09.440
The last thing I wanted to tell you guys about this Christmas elf.

48:09.440 --> 48:13.440
They, this Christmas elf spirit, sorry.

48:13.440 --> 48:17.440
They can't guarantee delivery before Christmas.

48:17.440 --> 48:18.440
Huh.

48:18.440 --> 48:24.440
28th is the, December 28th is what we're looking at.

48:24.440 --> 48:25.440
Right.

48:25.440 --> 48:26.440
This one.

48:26.440 --> 48:36.440
We know it might make it a bit more appealing if you could get your Christmas elf before Christmas, that's the ideal, but they cannot guarantee Christmas arrival of this spirit.

48:36.440 --> 48:39.440
December 28th is the best they can do.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.440
Now, does that make sense?

48:41.440 --> 48:51.440
Judging from what I know about these mystery spirits, I'm not sure I'd have the sort of emotional bandwidth to be able to focus on them in the way that they need in their run up.

48:51.440 --> 49:00.440
Well, and also they're booked up right now trying to convince old jerks, old rich jerks to be nicer.

49:00.440 --> 49:04.440
And as you might know, that isn't an easy thing to do.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.440
So maybe we can cut them a little bit of slack.

49:06.440 --> 49:10.440
And maybe after Christmas Santa kills a bunch of them to cut down on food costs.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
There it is.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
Well, that's it.

49:12.440 --> 49:17.440
In order for a new elf to be born, it has to rest in a pool of blood from an old Christmas elf.

49:17.440 --> 49:25.440
They don't talk about this, but every year the workforce is replenished or else we'd run out of magical elf spirits pretty quickly.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.440
Pretty fast, yeah.

49:26.440 --> 49:28.440
You want to do one more question?

49:28.440 --> 49:29.440
I'd love that.

49:29.440 --> 49:35.440
My girlfriend and I are celebrating our first holiday season living together and have loved decorating and getting into the holiday spirit.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.440
But there's one very obvious hole in our decorations.

49:37.440 --> 49:40.440
What should we put on the top of our Christmas tree?

49:40.440 --> 49:42.440
Should we stick with the classics?

49:42.440 --> 49:44.440
Should it reflect 2020?

49:44.440 --> 49:46.440
Or should we be thinking outside the box?

49:46.440 --> 49:49.440
And that's from Hatless Tree from down in DC.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.440
What do you guys put on the top of your trees?

49:51.440 --> 49:52.440
I mean a bow.

49:52.440 --> 49:53.440
A bow.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.440
It's so easy.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.440
You don't have to balance a big heavy.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.440
We used to put a big heavy metal star.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.440
What was I thinking?

49:59.440 --> 50:00.440
Dangerous is what that is.

50:00.440 --> 50:01.440
A bow.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.440
You just kind of throw it up there.

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
Whatever.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.440
It's at a crooked angle.

50:05.440 --> 50:06.440
It's a bow.

50:06.440 --> 50:08.440
It's a bow.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.440
I put a picture of myself up there.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.440
Of course.

50:11.440 --> 50:12.440
Yeah.

50:12.440 --> 50:13.440
But it's me.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.440
It's me.

50:14.440 --> 50:15.440
It's very tastefully done.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.440
It's me as an angel fully nude.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.440
Every year we, for the past 10 years.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.440
Yeah, Justin, I know you're wondering.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.440
My jumble is out.

50:24.440 --> 50:29.440
Every year for the past 10 years we've put our little Yoda up there.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.440
And we've had this Yoda tree topping for 10 years.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.440
You plug him in and his little lightsaber lights up.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.440
It's fantastic.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.440
And then I see on Twitter trending topic yesterday.

50:36.440 --> 50:40.440
Millennials are going wild about putting baby Yoda at the top of their tree.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.440
And it was infuriating to me because I got here first.

50:42.440 --> 50:45.440
Well, they're all putting Go-Gurt up there.

50:45.440 --> 50:47.440
And it makes you look like a real boob.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.440
They're putting TikTok up there.

50:49.440 --> 50:57.440
It should make you angry, Justin, because now you've got an old, busted, ugly, dirty adult Yoda up there.

50:57.440 --> 50:58.440
Yep.

50:58.440 --> 50:59.440
Gross.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.440
I want to-

51:00.440 --> 51:01.440
He said gross.

51:01.440 --> 51:02.440
I've been watching some Star Wars stuff here at the house.

51:02.440 --> 51:06.440
And whenever I see old adult Yoda, it makes me want to freaking barf.

51:06.440 --> 51:09.440
That dude makes me sick because-

51:09.440 --> 51:11.440
He looks like a green prune.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.440
Yeah.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.440
And now I know what he could look like, which is the baby Yoda.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.440
And it's not even close.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.440
It makes me sick.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.440
So I don't want to come to your house.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.440
I'm not going to be able to anyway.

51:21.440 --> 51:25.440
But even if I could, I wouldn't because of how gross your old Yoda is.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.440
You know what would be cool up there?

51:27.440 --> 51:28.440
Go the next step.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.440
Right?

51:29.440 --> 51:30.440
You got old Yoda.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.440
And then you got baby Yoda.

51:31.440 --> 51:34.440
Put some Yoda sperm up there.

51:34.440 --> 51:35.440
All right.

51:35.440 --> 51:37.440
So that's it.

51:37.440 --> 51:41.440
And here's the weird thing that we don't know about the-

51:41.440 --> 51:42.440
Well, I do.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.440
And I'm going to tell you about the Yoda species.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.440
It's just one big sperm.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.440
Not a bunch of little ones.

51:46.440 --> 51:47.440
Just one big sperm.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
All right.

51:48.440 --> 51:49.440
Hey, can I tell you?

51:49.440 --> 51:50.440
It's adorable.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.440
One shot I will have.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.440
You better start swimming.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.440
Here comes my blast.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.440
No, no, no.

51:57.440 --> 51:58.440
Don't move.

51:58.440 --> 52:03.440
I only have one blast.

52:03.440 --> 52:06.440
We're getting dangerously close to infringing on Magic Tavern territory.

52:06.440 --> 52:11.440
What would be sick is a full-sized basketball hoop.

52:11.440 --> 52:17.440
And then you could just do some powerful dunks and drain some threes.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.440
I like that.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.440
What about a live owl?

52:21.440 --> 52:23.440
That's pretty good.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.440
Can he be perched on the basketball hoop just blocking shots?

52:26.440 --> 52:29.440
Don't bring that weak stuff here.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.440
To Kimbe Matumbowl.

52:31.440 --> 52:36.440
Another tree?

52:36.440 --> 52:37.440
Huh.

52:37.440 --> 52:38.440
What about...

52:38.440 --> 52:41.440
This isn't weird, it's just a funny cowboy hat.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.440
And then on the bottom, what's that?

52:43.440 --> 52:44.440
Spurs.

52:44.440 --> 52:45.440
That's cool.

52:45.440 --> 52:46.440
That is funny.

52:46.440 --> 52:48.440
I'm glad you told me that was going to be funny before you said it.

52:48.440 --> 52:50.440
Or else I wouldn't have known.

52:50.440 --> 52:54.440
If you hadn't said it, I wouldn't have known.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.440
Huh.

52:55.440 --> 52:59.440
Well, sometimes things just get sillier and sillier on the show.

52:59.440 --> 53:03.440
And I wanted to bring it back in to a possible actual answer.

53:03.440 --> 53:08.440
And sure, we de-escalated from Yoda sperm back to...

53:08.440 --> 53:11.440
That was the obvious off-ramp.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.440
Thank you so much for listening.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.440
Very quick, just to reiterate.

53:15.440 --> 53:20.440

You got it.

It's new and revised for 2020.

54:32.440 --> 54:37.440
And that's at bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

54:37.440 --> 54:41.440
And MBMBAMANGELS is back.

54:41.440 --> 54:45.440
Go to MBMBAMANGELS.com to claim a stocking.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.440
I want to give a quick plug for that.

54:46.440 --> 54:49.440
That's a program that has been going for a long time

54:49.440 --> 54:52.440
and we sort of got the ball rolling, but we've had a lot of amazing fans

54:52.440 --> 54:53.440
pick it up since then.

54:53.440 --> 54:59.440
Every year people in our area have this list called the empty stockings

54:59.440 --> 55:01.440
that is published in the newspaper.

55:01.440 --> 55:06.440
And it's for people that aren't going to have a Christmas without some help.

55:06.440 --> 55:11.440
And every year our listeners take that list and they demolish it.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.440
They burn it down with generosity.

55:13.440 --> 55:14.440
Yeah, in a good way.

55:14.440 --> 55:15.440
In a good way.

55:15.440 --> 55:20.440
And if you can join in with them, it's not a big push this year

55:20.440 --> 55:22.440
because honestly it's been a hard year for people

55:22.440 --> 55:25.440
and it seems weird to force it really hard.

55:25.440 --> 55:29.440
But if you can, it looks like they're, judging by the progress bar,

55:29.440 --> 55:31.440
it looks like they're about 75% of the way there.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
So Christmas is coming soon.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.440
Please, please, please go to MBMBAMANGELS.com.

55:36.440 --> 55:39.440
You can just donate money if you don't feel like calling,

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
but there's specific stockings.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.440
You can claim one and help people out.

55:42.440 --> 55:45.440
And there's a lot of really deserving folks in there.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.440
So please go help out.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.440
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song

55:49.440 --> 55:52.440
It's a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

55:52.440 --> 55:54.440
It's getting me through this long winter if you know what I'm saying.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.440
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

55:56.440 --> 55:57.440
Go to MaximumFun.org.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
Check out all the great shows there.

55:59.440 --> 56:00.440
They got shows like Triple Click.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.440
They got shows like Mission to ZX.

56:02.440 --> 56:06.440
They got all kinds of fun stuff all at MaximumFun.org.

56:06.440 --> 56:07.440
Do you want the final?

56:07.440 --> 56:08.440
Yes.

56:08.440 --> 56:09.440
This one's actually holiday themed.

56:09.440 --> 56:12.440
I know the other Yahoo wasn't, but this one is.

56:12.440 --> 56:13.440
It was sent in by Graham Robot.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.440
Thank you, Graham.

56:14.440 --> 56:17.440
It's from Yahoo Answers user Brian who asks,

56:17.440 --> 56:24.440
Is it weird to find the Monty Python foot crushing thing sexy?

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
My name is Justin McElroy.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.440
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:30.440 --> 56:31.440
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

56:31.440 --> 56:32.440
Kiss your dad.

56:32.440 --> 56:56.440
Score on the lips.
