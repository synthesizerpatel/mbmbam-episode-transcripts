00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.600 --> 00:14.600
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:14.600 --> 00:23.500
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.200
What's up, you cool baby?

00:27.200 --> 00:55.200
It's Familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:55.200 --> 01:12.700
People ask me, Justin, how are Minneapolis audiences?

01:12.700 --> 01:22.300
And I tell them, Minneapolis audiences are the horniest audiences in the world.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.800
You're all so horny, it's a little overwhelming.

01:25.800 --> 01:32.300
Hello, my name is Justin McElroy, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the Modern Era.

01:32.300 --> 01:38.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.600
The first Justin was more of an emcee, and then I was walking myself into the character of Justin McElroy.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.800
You know, that's true, because we are all just a character we play.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.100
That's so deep, Travis.

01:48.100 --> 02:01.000
And the character I'll be embodying this evening is your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.700
And I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Griffin McElroy.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.200
I've... we, uh, we played...

02:12.200 --> 02:16.600
Travis did, I want it on the audio record, Travis did just shush Griffin's applause.

02:16.600 --> 02:21.300
He gave you a... I just thought it was a little bit like y'all were just trying to make a point.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.500
Like, we like Griffin! Yeah, okay.

02:23.500 --> 02:30.700
We did a show in Minneapolis like two years ago, and I'm remembering now the horniness.

02:30.700 --> 02:38.900
I'm not saying this for applause, because when y'all were doing that thing you just did, it was like, oh yeah!

02:38.900 --> 02:41.700
So horny. Holy shit.

02:41.700 --> 02:48.700
Uh, what's up? We, like the Chilean miners, we've emerged from the ground and returned to you, Minneapolis.

02:48.700 --> 02:54.200
I just think of everything we've done for the past few years as sort of like dead air between our two performances.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.700
Oh yeah, absolutely.

02:55.700 --> 03:02.700
I measure everything in how long it's been since Minneapolis.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.700
We're so happy to be in the Orpheum, because this place is fucking beautiful.

03:06.700 --> 03:11.700
I said it, did I say, I said it? Yeah, the Orpheum. It's so beautiful.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.700
I thought, I wanted to say Morpheus, but that's the fucking Matrix.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.100
We're in the Orpheum. Can we get the chandelier turned on?

03:19.100 --> 03:23.700
Because this place has the most buckwild chandelier I've ever... I don't know if you have the chandelier switch.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.900
Whoa, they broke it.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.100
My angel of music!

03:28.100 --> 03:28.700
There it is.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.000
Look at it.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.100
So we were talking about it backstage, and here's the thing, y'all.

03:37.100 --> 03:41.900
We're going to need you to help us steal that chandelier.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.100
Oh, it's going away. They're turning the lights off.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.900
Please don't steal our chandelier. Please don't steal this chandelier.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.200
We're going to need someone who's good at gymnastics.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.600
We're going to need a hacker.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.800
We're going to need a face.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.900
We're going to need a face person, a person with a face, I guess.

03:54.900 --> 04:00.100
We're going to need someone who's not afraid to get in there and mix it up and scrap the people.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.200
We're going to need...

04:01.200 --> 04:02.200
A gun haver.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.700
A gun haver.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.900
We're going to need someone with a van.

04:05.900 --> 04:09.200
We're going to need someone to go get burgers.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.100
We're going to need someone to just say, like, hey, how's everybody doing?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.900
You guys doing okay? Do you need anything?

04:13.900 --> 04:19.000
Show of hands, has anybody in here ever stolen anything that's worth more than $100?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.500
Wow, a lot of good people in the audience tonight.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.700
No, that balcony. That's full of crooks.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.000
The balcony's nasty.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.600
You all can't see it, but you balcony folks are nasty.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.900
Which is great. They're closer to the chandelier.

04:31.900 --> 04:37.000
Also need to say, because sometimes our fans take things very seriously, please don't steal a chandelier.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.800
No, don't.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.500
No, you know what, Griffin? I'm sorry.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.600
If y'all can figure out how to get up there...

04:42.600 --> 04:45.500
No, we're not entreating you to steal a chandelier.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.300
Wink.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.700
They won't give us the money for the show.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.500
They won't.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.000
Because they're like, you stole our chandelier.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Take it out of the chandelier sales.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.600
Finding a pawn shop big enough is the problem.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.200
Yeah.

04:58.200 --> 04:58.900
Because getting in there...

04:58.900 --> 05:00.800
And ritzy enough.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.600
Yeah, you're going to find a fence with very specific needs.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.700
Can we all just eat a little bit of the chandelier?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.700
Oh, no, they are turning it off now.

05:10.700 --> 05:16.700
Thank you, chandelier. Everybody, big hands for the chandelier.

05:16.700 --> 05:23.700
For our listeners at home, there's a very big, good chandelier in the room.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.900
And we're gonna eat it.

05:24.900 --> 05:25.700
And we're gonna eat it.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.100
Every last delicious crystalline bite.

05:28.100 --> 05:34.100
And we're gonna steal the smaller chandeliers down here to give it to the big chandelier.

05:34.100 --> 05:34.900
As tribute.

05:34.900 --> 05:38.000
As tribute or fuel.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.300
This one used to be small and they kept feeding it small chandeliers.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.800
And it got so big.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.400
So we're gonna need to turn it off, right?

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
I'm just gonna stare at it.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.600
It's so gorgeous.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
They're like, no one's ever asked us to turn it off.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.300
We don't know how to turn it off.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.300
We're gonna do...

05:53.300 --> 05:56.100
So we're gonna do an intermission a little bit in so we can go pee.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.400
That's the truth.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.100
Right now.

05:58.100 --> 06:01.300
Thanks, y'all. You've been great.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.700
And then after that, we're gonna do some audience questions.

06:03.700 --> 06:07.600
And y'all know the rule for audience questions?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.500
No more!

06:09.500 --> 06:10.100
Cool.

06:10.100 --> 06:14.300
There is now a second rule that we've added, which is ask for actual advice.

06:14.300 --> 06:14.600
Yeah.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.100
Please give us a question.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.600
No anecdotes.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.700
It just doesn't give us much of a runway.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.100
We take your questions on the show and we turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.300
Let's do that damn thing.

06:24.300 --> 06:24.900
Let's do the damn thing.

06:24.900 --> 06:25.800
Let's get dirty.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.400
Let's twist it.

06:29.400 --> 06:34.500
My husband and I have two cats that both use the toilet.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.100
In our house.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.200
No, you don't.

06:36.200 --> 06:41.000
You mean like use a toilet, not like go to the bathroom because everybody's cat does that.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, they use the actual literal toilet.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.100
In our house, we only have one toilet.

06:45.100 --> 06:49.100
That is something that you probably should have thought about before you taught the cats to use it.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.600
When we have guests over, we ask them to leave the toilet seat up

06:52.600 --> 06:55.800
and to flush if they see any pee or poop in there.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.600
Is that last part too gross?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.000
I never thought of it before,

06:59.000 --> 07:04.400
but I realize it might be disgusting to ask some folks we have over to look for poop and flush it down.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.200
Is that weird?

07:05.200 --> 07:06.900
And that's from the Cats Can't Flush.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.100
Are you here?

07:09.100 --> 07:10.800
Are you here?

07:10.800 --> 07:11.600
All right.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.700
Everybody cheered all at once.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.000
Oh, you're a hive mind.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.600
Okay, cool.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.100
We are, we are here.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.800
I will say this.

07:20.800 --> 07:26.500
First off, I want to get into the cats shitting on the toilet because that's chef kiss.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.000
But I don't know that you need to give your guests special instructions

07:31.000 --> 07:33.600
for what to do if there's poop or pee in the toilet

07:33.600 --> 07:36.900
because it would be a fairly rowdy houseguest who's like,

07:36.900 --> 07:38.700
huh, look at that, a bunch of dookie.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.600
Anyway, like presumably.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.100
Is that just what they do here?

07:43.100 --> 07:43.600
Cool.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.000
Cool.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.300
Okay.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.700
Well, allow me to join.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.500
When in Rome, I suppose.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.600
Oh, you're a bee.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.500
Here's my leavings.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
Adios.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.800
I think...

07:54.800 --> 07:57.900
That was really gross.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.600
I hated being on stage for that.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.600
Let me ask you this.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.200
What's weirder?

08:03.200 --> 08:07.200
Telling your guests like, hey, we've trained our cats to use the toilet.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.800
So you might need to flush after them.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.600
That's the weirdest possible.

08:10.600 --> 08:16.800
Or two, we keep a box full of dirt and it's just got poop in it all the time.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.700
We keep a box full of dirt that they poop in it.

08:18.700 --> 08:21.400
And then by the way, the dirt smells worse than the poop.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.400
Hey, cat litter manufacturers.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.600
Can you do something?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.700
It smells really bad already.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.200
That's the base state.

08:32.200 --> 08:38.600
There's never cat litter that's like, is somebody making fried chicken?

08:38.600 --> 08:42.300
I think it would be so funny to see little poop in the toilet.

08:42.300 --> 08:45.300
It looks like David the Gnome got in there and wrecked your biz.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.400
I would love that.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.600
I would be so excited.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.400
I don't think I'd be able to flush it.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.500
I'd be too stoked.

08:50.500 --> 08:56.100
Aww, look at that little kitty in his biz.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.900
You know the bad part about seeing the kitty poop in the toilet?

08:58.900 --> 08:59.200
What?

08:59.200 --> 09:06.900
Is that you know upon seeing it that you missed the cat shitting in the toilet.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.600
Oh man, he's not gonna do it again tonight.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.700
Oh man, can't believe it.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.900
You think he sits there and reads a little kitty paper?

09:13.900 --> 09:18.500
Little kitty magazine. He's a big fan of Garfield.

09:18.500 --> 09:25.400
I can't understand the amount of work that goes into teaching a cat to do a person thing.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.900
Like using a toilet.

09:26.900 --> 09:34.100
And you can't go the final yard there to cross the 100 yard line into the touchdown area

09:34.100 --> 09:39.100
by forcing them to learn how to operate a very small lever.

09:39.100 --> 09:45.300
You did you did the hard part which was convincing a cat to pee where you wanted them to.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.800
Specifically a big bowl like a big thing.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.000
Like how did you start that?

09:51.000 --> 09:57.500
Like hey cat shit in this room wherever and so they I'll just narrow it down.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.300
It's different places you get shit.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.200
The answer is the bowl.

10:01.200 --> 10:06.900
The question is where does it stop?

10:06.900 --> 10:10.800
Because you can teach your cat to shit in the toilet and then you can teach your cat to flush.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.800
And then well, I guess you should teach a cat to wash its little paws.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.500
And then it's like now please get off to school.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.900
Please go get a job.

10:20.900 --> 10:27.300
I guess I had a joke but you guys can go ahead and do yours first.

10:27.300 --> 10:32.000
It's just these jokes and this question is like

10:32.000 --> 10:37.700
meet the parents kind already dug this one out for us and I don't know that it's and this is gonna be funnier

10:37.700 --> 10:40.800
because they had a long time to sit in a room and figure out fun.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.800
Ben and Robbie De Niro got together and they're like we got three weeks.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.500
Let's think of some really funny stuff to say and we just have to say it right away.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.500
Do it immediately. It's not fair.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.300
Ben Stiller gets all the breaks.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.300
How about a yahoo though?

10:57.300 --> 11:02.800
I love that.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.200
Sorry my eyes stopped opening there for a second.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.200
The road man.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
How about this one? It was sent in by Lauren McPherson.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.900
Thank you Lauren. It's yahoo answers user cotton.

11:13.900 --> 11:17.500
That's really their name. Nice.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.200
Cotton asks.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.300
My bed smell bad.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.100
I tried everything I could but the mattress still smell bad.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.700
What can I do?

11:30.700 --> 11:31.800
Mattress smell bad.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.500
Oh man.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.300
My bed smell bad.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.600
I tried everything.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.800
Shoot my bed.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.500
I tried everything.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.100
Big washing machine.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.500
Hose and soap.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.000
Bed smell bad still.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.700
Wet washcloth.

11:49.700 --> 11:50.600
Pine saw.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.700
Tricky car wash.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.700
Risky candle. My bed smell bad.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.900
Risky candles and the bed smell bad.

11:58.900 --> 12:02.000
Wish on star.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Bed smell bad.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.400
Bed smell bad.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
Oh man.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.100
Sometimes you stay in a friend's guest room.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.800
And I just did this in Chicago.

12:13.800 --> 12:22.100
So this is not a read on them but.

12:22.100 --> 12:22.800
Bed smell bad.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.300
Bed can smell bad.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.600
And you know it's great.

12:27.600 --> 12:32.400
Bed has sheet bed has pillow bed comfort is great.

12:32.400 --> 12:38.200
It sounds like you're leaving off a certain aspect about bed bed bed smell bad.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.800
Yeah, and you know what bed doesn't spontaneously smell bad.

12:41.800 --> 12:50.900
No like a bed has never just started smelling bad for no reason bed smell bad long time.

12:50.900 --> 12:56.800
Bed smell good forever except human.

12:56.800 --> 13:03.700
You've been made bad smell bad smell bad bad human try bucket for breeze.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.800
Wish on star.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.600
Uh-huh. No good.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.100
Still stink dreams still take dreams.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.700
Extra incense.

13:12.700 --> 13:17.100
Five six bed smell bad.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.700
What can we do about the bed smell bad though?

13:19.700 --> 13:21.600
The bed smell.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.000
What was it?

13:23.000 --> 13:29.800
I think we've tapped it.

13:29.800 --> 13:30.700
We've tapped it, right?

13:30.700 --> 13:36.100
There's no more than me and all the ways bed smell bad smell bad or better.

13:36.100 --> 13:39.000
Does anybody else have any ones they want to kick in?

13:39.000 --> 13:39.900
Bed smell bad.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.600
Bed smell bad.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.500
Tried everything.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.100
Try everything.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
That'd be bad.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.600
Well, people are now offering handy suggestions on how to make that.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.200
Yeah, fuck Heloise.

13:49.200 --> 13:54.100
No, I just we're just trying to a comedy show up here the bed smell bad.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.100
How about another question?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.700
I don't care about this bed anymore.

13:56.700 --> 13:57.700
That's the end.

13:57.700 --> 14:03.000
I fucking hate this bed now stupid bed for the last couple of months.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.700
I've spent some of my downtime watching YouTube tutorials on how to do some card tricks.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.300
It was never serious interest but something I could show friends after a couple of tricks.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.800
Okay, so you've been learning how to do card tricks.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.300
Let's just lay it out there.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.700
Let's put the tiger on the table accidentally learn card trick, right?

14:18.700 --> 14:24.100
I was watching them and it turns out picked up a couple things watching other people do card tricks on YouTube.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.300
Yeah, I know one of my friends was so impressed.

14:27.300 --> 14:35.900
He decided to talk his boss into hiring me to perform at their company holiday party.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.500
In a month without my knowledge.

14:38.500 --> 14:47.300
I know about 10 card tricks with about three good ones.

14:47.300 --> 14:54.000
Oh, no, do I take it on and risk embarrassing myself and my friend or do I decline the chance to make some extra cash?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.500
That's from maybe magical in Minneapolis.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.500
Holy shit.

14:59.500 --> 15:06.000
Are you here?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.100
That was the best.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.700
Yeah.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.700
It was a very oh shit.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.600
They just turned into a bunch of doves.

15:12.600 --> 15:23.400
Fuck it's just that like you gave yourself an out in the email, which I appreciate because there's no amount of money.

15:23.400 --> 15:28.800
You could pay me to go somewhere and do bad at magic in front of people.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.800
I do like though.

15:29.800 --> 15:34.800
I didn't think about this and I was going through but now I'm thinking about it hearing Justin read it out loud.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.000
You are considering doing yeah.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.700
Yeah, that's the real problem, isn't it?

15:39.700 --> 15:46.100
Like there is a part of you that's like listen, I know how it's gonna go but it's money.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.200
Just Matt. It's just card tricks.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.800
I feel like you could hire a plant or several.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.600
Yes is sort of like was this your card?

15:55.600 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, it totally was.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.500
And then someone next to him like it was his card.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.200
He's not a plant.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.300
This guy's not a plant.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.100
I came with this dude.

16:06.100 --> 16:12.300
He works at HR, you know, everyone's plans is every single person except the boss.

16:12.300 --> 16:20.600
Can you just take the money you were gonna get for the show and give everybody like $4 and just be like, please be cool.

16:20.600 --> 16:26.900
Here's one consolation if it helps they can pay somebody to do card tricks at a party.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.800
You can't pay me to watch card tricks at a party.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.400
So you there's a very good chance.

16:31.400 --> 16:37.100
He could walk into a room be like hey everybody. I got something everyone can enjoy press the vegetation.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.800
Bye-bye-bye. Bye-bye-bye. There's punch.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.300
Goodbye.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.900
Also, I don't know what this business is, but your friend deserves a raise if he can sell.

16:44.900 --> 16:48.100
Hey, I saw my friend do a card trick so good.

16:48.100 --> 16:52.300
You should pay them to perform at our holiday party.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.200
That's a hard sell.

16:54.200 --> 16:54.800
That's tough.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.600
Okay. Okay. Okay.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.600
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.000
Table. Four chairs around it.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Say this is very intimate set.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I do intimate close-up magic.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.300
They keep saying the word intimate over and over again.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.400
Yeah, say intimate a lot.

17:09.400 --> 17:14.100
Then you're like if I'm gonna get if I'm gonna get everybody through my set.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.700
I can only do about three tricks.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.200
I'm sorry. I know many more great ones.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.600
Oh, so good. Even better than the ones I'm doing now.

17:21.600 --> 17:25.200
Even better than the ones I do now, but these are my intimate set.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.800
This is my three song intimate set that I can only do with four people.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.100
Then you just turn them through so you don't have to keep it up for 15, 20, 30 minutes.

17:33.100 --> 17:37.300
It's just like five minutes of intimate close-up magic.

17:37.300 --> 17:47.900
Speaking of intimacy, one other thing you could do is introduce some light stripping and erotica.

17:47.900 --> 17:57.900
Like you only need three tricks if each one is preceded by 15 minutes of tasteful erotica.

17:57.900 --> 18:02.100
Justin, is the erotica tied into the show?

18:02.100 --> 18:07.400
Oh, yeah, we're talking about ace of clubs, ace of spades, both pasties.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.800
Like is this your card? Does it even matter anymore?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
Is this your card? No, it's not.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.700
That's the jack of diamonds.

18:13.700 --> 18:14.700
I had the three of hearts.

18:14.700 --> 18:19.500
Oh, well, here's my butt.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.800
Is it gonna say my card on your butt?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.100
No. Here's what I can guarantee you.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.800
If you introduce some light tasteful erotica into your office party,

18:28.800 --> 18:36.200
no one afterwards will be commenting about how few tricks you knew.

18:36.200 --> 18:42.400
That is a promise from me to you.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.500
You want a Yahoo?

18:43.500 --> 18:45.400
Sure.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.500
This one was sent in by Stefan Ruby.

18:47.500 --> 18:52.000
Thank you, Stefan. It's Yahoo Answers user Ned Racine.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.900
Oh, last name, too.

18:54.900 --> 19:07.700
Ned asks, invent new sport, bird fishing.

19:07.700 --> 19:11.700
Just right off the bat, can I point out birding then?

19:11.700 --> 19:12.900
That's a different thing.

19:12.900 --> 19:13.900
That's a different thing entirely.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.600
I know, but you can't put fish-ing in there.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.600
Yeah, sure. I'm going deer fishing.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.100
Do you mean... You mean hunting, right?

19:22.100 --> 19:25.500
Just think of it.

19:25.500 --> 19:31.300
Hooking a tough old nasty crow on your line.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.700
Having the bird take to the skies.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.400
Having the drag on your real spewing out line.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.100
Fuck.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.000
Having more fun... Finishing.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.200
Finishing.

19:43.200 --> 19:49.000
Completing. Achieving.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.200
Having more fun than flying a kite as the bird soars into the blue sky.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.500
You nasty, Ned.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.300
You real nasty, Ned.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.400
Finally, like fishing, do the catch and release.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.100
Sounds like a lot of fun.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.700
You could even invent special lures, etc.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.200
Great new sport.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.300
But what would be the open season?

20:08.300 --> 20:10.300
Would there be some species off limits?

20:10.300 --> 20:13.300
Give me your input, please.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.900
Yeah, Ned. I think there will be some species off limits.

20:15.900 --> 20:22.300
Yeah, Ned. There's already some species off limits, Ned.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.000
Did you kill this bald eagle?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.800
No, I did not, officer. I fished it.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.700
I fished it.

20:26.700 --> 20:27.800
Out of the sky.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.500
Gonna eat it, so it's good.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.800
Now it's good and legal.

20:32.800 --> 20:37.700
Oh, Ned. You caught me again.

20:37.700 --> 20:41.700
The problem I have with this, everything about it is great.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.700
Agreed.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.500
And logical and good and right and pure.

20:45.500 --> 20:50.000
But the thing about birds are, they're not smart animals,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.600
but if you as a bird see a worm in the sky,

20:54.600 --> 20:57.900
you are going to know something is up.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.800
A bird, a worm in a lake, a fish thinks like,

21:00.800 --> 21:03.600
oh, it is not your lucky day, fell in the lake.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.600
No swimmy, a chomp, chomp, chomp.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.500
Right.

21:06.500 --> 21:12.200
Unless, bird sees a worm in the sky and thinks like,

21:12.200 --> 21:15.000
look at that magic worm.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.800
I'm not going to let this opportunity pass me by.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.300
I have to know what the magic worm tastes like.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.300
That's a very short-sighted worm though,

21:21.300 --> 21:24.800
because if I was a bird, I would say, go magic worm.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.100
Make others like you for future generations of birds to enjoy.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.900
You make my job so much easier, magic worm.

21:30.900 --> 21:36.400
Do you think that in bird fishing,

21:36.400 --> 21:39.200
you're like the bobber would be like a balloon?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.200
I think a balloon and a worm.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.200
Because you couldn't just like throw it up in the air

21:44.200 --> 21:46.700
and hope that that second was when a bird went.

21:46.700 --> 21:52.300
Travis, you're making this perilously close to a great achievable idea.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.600
Okay, I will say, the balloon really took me,

21:54.600 --> 21:56.800
because like, I'll credit to you,

21:56.800 --> 22:00.100
I was having a trouble with my mind's eye getting the worm up there.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.600
But of course the balloon, excellent.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.900
No, I mean, we're on some busy world of Richard's scary shit for sure.

22:06.900 --> 22:12.200
No, listen, I don't support this, but with a few tweaks.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.500
Yeah, I don't support it,

22:13.500 --> 22:16.700
but I don't know how you can not support this and support fishing.

22:16.700 --> 22:20.300
Because in fishing, you're like, ha ha ha, here's the water worm.

22:20.300 --> 22:23.000
At least this time you're giving this worm the best day ever,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.400
the most unbelievable story of all time.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.500
Yeah.

22:26.500 --> 22:30.800
But here's the problem, and I love that this person in this question is like,

22:30.800 --> 22:35.100
and then you catch and release the bird.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.200
I don't think that's how that's gonna go.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.800
Yeah.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.500
You have plausible deniability when you catch and release a fish,

22:41.500 --> 22:44.200
because it's like, I got him, but don't worry,

22:44.200 --> 22:48.300
I just put a hook through you, but you're free, splash, gone.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.300
And then you don't have to see it.

22:49.300 --> 22:54.600
You don't get that with a bird, unless it's very foggy outside, maybe.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.200
Or you throw it very hard.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.000
And turn around real quick.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.400
Where did you go?

23:01.400 --> 23:05.200
With a fish, you can be like, ah, did you get hooked on some sort of line?

23:05.200 --> 23:07.500
Allow me to help, little aquatic friend.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.800
I can't believe somebody did that to you.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.800
A bird watched you.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.500
And also, a bird doesn't need to run and hide back in water to live.

23:14.500 --> 23:18.000
A bird's just gonna chill there and maybe talk to you about what just happened.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.500
Hey, what the fuck?

23:19.500 --> 23:21.300
What the fuck?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.500
I was here for that whole thing.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.600
Yeah, I saw all of it.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.300
Do not invent new sport bird fishing.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.700
But if you do, the balloon is mine.

23:32.700 --> 23:37.600
We will happily be the announcers if you go pro.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.200
But it will just involve a lot of this.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.000
Oh, no.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.100
Oh, shit, shit.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.100
Oh, that's horrible to watch.

23:44.100 --> 23:48.500
Oh, it's everywhere.

23:48.500 --> 23:53.500
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

23:53.500 --> 23:57.300
Get your friend Doug to spray bugs, farm wisdom.

23:57.300 --> 23:57.900
That's right.

23:57.900 --> 24:03.500
Farm wisdom is back tonight only for our friends in Minneapolis.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
I didn't even tell.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.000
This is a surprise to them.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.600
I got a whole page here of farm fun facts that I looked up.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.700
And we're just going to talk about farms for a second.

24:13.700 --> 24:17.900
Y'all got farms in Minnesota?

24:17.900 --> 24:19.300
Oh, my God, you're all farmers.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.500
Well, shit.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.900
You all know this already.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.400
Yes, that is true.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.300
That thing you said.

24:25.300 --> 24:30.400
This is a very complete list with a lot of ups and downs.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.000
If something is not funny, we're just going to move on past it.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.500
Okay, but you'll learn something and that's the important thing.

24:35.500 --> 24:41.600
Goats are great companions for other farm animals, including horses, cows, and chickens.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.400
That's a good hang.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.300
That's a good hang right there.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.700
Also, not true.

24:46.700 --> 24:51.500
There are very few animals that will just ram shit.

24:51.500 --> 24:57.900
One mature ewe, a female sheep, produces seven to ten pounds of newly shorn wool a year,

24:57.900 --> 25:00.100
enough to make a man's suit.

25:00.100 --> 25:04.200
Presumably, a very patient man.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.100
Go ahead.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.900
No, it's fine.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.500
Prom's not for another seven months.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.200
I can wait.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.400
Just keep growing it.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.900
Goats were the first animal to be domesticated, according to many historians.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.600
There's no way.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.400
According to some people who don't know shit, like no way.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.200
It wasn't goats.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.500
Trust me.

25:26.500 --> 25:31.900
Pigs are considered the fourth most intelligent animal after chimpanzees, dolphins, and elephants.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.600
Wait, what about humans?

25:33.600 --> 25:35.700
We're not on the list.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.700
Didn't rank.

25:37.700 --> 25:38.200
Here's a good one.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.500
Ow.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.000
Cows can recognize their names.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.900
Fuck you.

25:42.900 --> 25:47.400
But though, though, they may not come when called.

25:47.400 --> 25:52.000
Okay, honestly, list, fuck off.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.100
Sometimes when I say my cow's name, it comes to me.

25:55.100 --> 25:59.200
Sometimes, it doesn't.

25:59.200 --> 26:04.200
How do you, okay, because the only way I could think that this is a fact is that you would say like,

26:04.200 --> 26:07.100
Steven, and the cow would turn and go, no.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.800
No, no, no.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.600
No, man.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.200
Maybe that's just not the cow's name.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.200
Whoa.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.900
Just got a proud cow name that you don't even know about.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.800
What if you just named all your cows cow, right?

26:23.800 --> 26:24.600
It'd be very efficient.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.400
Cow.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.000
When do you ever want just the one cat?

26:27.000 --> 26:33.100
Well, there's a time when you just want the one cow.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.300
Slow cow.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.400
Oh, man.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.900
I gotta stop eating meat.

26:39.900 --> 26:44.900
This fact actually is, this is in sequence, and this fact actually comes at this point.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.400
Female sheep are called ewes.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.600
Yeah, I know.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.700
Could have used that earlier.

26:48.700 --> 26:49.800
That was up the list.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.300
That was earlier.

26:51.300 --> 26:55.100
And that came like, oh shit, did I say it?

26:55.100 --> 26:55.800
I'll add it in.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.100
I'm not going to scroll back up.

26:57.100 --> 27:00.000
Cows have a memory of about three years.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.900
So don't name your cow four years ago.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.800
That's what it is.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.700
Cows have a memory of about three, so you could tell if three years have elapsed, but hey,

27:08.700 --> 27:14.900
do you remember me owing you any money in 2014?

27:14.900 --> 27:15.400
No.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.600
Okay, excellent.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.700
How do you, how the fuck do you know that?

27:18.700 --> 27:19.800
Honestly.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.200
Especially, and I have to say, about three years.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.400
About three years.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.200
Some are more forgetful than others.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.900
Goats are great swimmers.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.000
Goats are fantastic.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.900
Okay.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.700
What cannot goats do?

27:33.700 --> 27:35.800
I don't know that I have a memory of three years.

27:35.800 --> 27:36.700
Yeah.

27:36.700 --> 27:42.900
Yeah, now that I think about it, geese are fateful, and they mate for life, and they

27:42.900 --> 27:45.300
mourn when their partner dies.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.100
Ah, shit.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.300
That's not so much a fact.

27:47.300 --> 27:48.700
It's just like, hey.

27:48.700 --> 27:51.300
And also, devoid, no bummers, Justin.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.000
No bummers.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.400
Cows can sense a storm coming, and will lie down.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.600
Okay, stop, stop.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.400
It is time.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.300
We need a peer review.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.600
Where is this list from, Justin?

28:04.600 --> 28:06.300
It's just farm stuff.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.600
No, my buddy.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.500
I screenshotted it.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.000
I don't know.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I don't have an internet connection anymore.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.100
Can I jump back to the geese are fateful thing?

28:12.100 --> 28:18.300
Yeah, and then I'll jump back to the cows being like, ah, storm coming later.

28:18.300 --> 28:21.600
I think it's great to say, geese are fateful.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.800
All of them.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.300
You know there's nasty geese.

28:25.300 --> 28:29.900
Right, there's the geese out there that's like, listen, when the other geese is away

28:29.900 --> 28:30.800
or whatever.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.500
I don't know, geese, whatever.

28:32.500 --> 28:37.500
But that idea of all, you know, geese will never, never be nasty.

28:37.500 --> 28:43.300
Listen, when you're surrounded by so many of those long, elegant, beautiful, sexy, curved

28:43.300 --> 28:46.700
necks, it is hard not, and those necks they got, they can look all around.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.400
You know geese aren't swans, right?

28:48.400 --> 28:51.000
Like swans aren't geese, geese aren't swans.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.600
Swans are, it doesn't matter.

28:52.600 --> 28:58.100
It's not really playing with me in the space a little bit.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.300
It feels like maybe right now as much as it could be.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.400
We have a room full of farmers here, Griffith.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.900
It's true.

29:02.900 --> 29:08.000
This room is farmers only.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.900
Are you done with your fake list of farm bullshit?

29:10.900 --> 29:17.700
At this point, I do start to worry that the person who wrote this list started to take

29:17.700 --> 29:21.500
their love of goats and sort of delve into fan fiction.

29:21.500 --> 29:26.300
Because the next fact on here is goats have rectangular pupils allowing them to see well

29:26.300 --> 29:27.500
in the dark.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.000
I think that one's actually legit.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.800
That one's legit?

29:29.800 --> 29:33.700
No, they legit have rectangular pupils, but like I thought you were going to say like

29:33.700 --> 29:37.100
Jeremy is the best goat.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.600
I love you Jeremy.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.600
Fact, Jeremy is always there for me.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.900
Jeremy is also faithful and he...

29:44.900 --> 29:51.500
Some wild goats can climb trees and can walk along a ledge, but not much wider than a tightrope.

29:51.500 --> 29:55.400
I like this one because that means at some point a human was watching a goat approach

29:55.400 --> 30:00.300
something terrible and said, let's see where this goes.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.400
You know, you never know.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.300
Let's see how this shakes out.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.400
I also like some wild goats can, some can't.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.700
Some can't.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.200
There's a wild goat try a tree all day.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.200
Nothing's doing.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.000
How will you know the difference?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.600
There's one way to find out.

30:15.600 --> 30:20.200
Not all goats can walk across thin ledges, but eventually all goats will be able to.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.000
Jeremy can fucking do it.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.800
Jeremy the best goat.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.600
Here is another question.

30:29.600 --> 30:34.000
Some friends and I are at my buddy's parents house to stay for the weekend.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Oh, I like this present tense.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I've never been here or met his parents before.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.100
It was a road trip away and 15 minutes after arriving, I went upstairs to use their luxury

30:44.100 --> 30:45.400
rain head shower.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.400
Got that road stink on you.

30:48.400 --> 30:52.700
Unbeknownst to me, the handle was only meant to turn 90 degrees.

30:52.700 --> 31:00.200
I proceeded to turn it 180 in one swift motion, ripping it off the wall.

31:00.200 --> 31:06.900
Currently I'm naked and damp and the shower won't turn off more party guests will be arriving

31:06.900 --> 31:08.100
within the hour.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.200
This is socially awkward.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.400
Defcon one.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.300
What do I do?

31:12.300 --> 31:17.300
And this person has literally just written Derek Brown from Osseo, Minnesota.

31:17.300 --> 31:21.300
So just like, don't even question it.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.300
Derek.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.300
I'm assuming Derek's not here.

31:23.300 --> 31:24.300
Derek cannot be here.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.300
Derek cannot be here.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.300
Someone's parents just heard that and they're like, wait, what?

31:28.300 --> 31:29.300
What?

31:29.300 --> 31:30.300
Oh shit.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.300
You said it was the dog.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.300
Derek, are you here?

31:33.300 --> 31:36.300
He made it out.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.300
Okay.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.300
Oh shit.

31:39.300 --> 31:45.700
There's so many elements at play here.

31:45.700 --> 31:51.600
You could play it off just like, you've got a cool new water feature now.

31:51.600 --> 31:57.240
It's upstairs and inside and forever and forever.

31:57.240 --> 32:01.600
So it just takes the water through the drain and then recycles it back up to the, no, the

32:01.600 --> 32:04.740
utilities are, you would not believe.

32:04.740 --> 32:08.460
Also there's no hot water anywhere else in the house.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.520
How strong are you?

32:10.520 --> 32:12.020
You very strong, Derek?

32:12.020 --> 32:14.020
He's so strong.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.020
Too strong.

32:15.020 --> 32:20.500
That was the, that was the, sorry, weakest delivery of the sentence.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
I'm so strong.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.060
Usually it's, I'm so strong.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.060
I am.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.060
No, I am very strong.

32:26.060 --> 32:29.700
Because right now Derek knows that there is only shame in that string.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.700
Yeah.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.260
This is the moment where Hercules just can't control the power and knocks over all the

32:34.260 --> 32:35.260
columns.

32:35.260 --> 32:36.260
Yeah.

32:36.260 --> 32:37.260
You know what I mean?

32:37.260 --> 32:38.260
And he's not like, boom, you know, this is set.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.260
Can I ask you something, Derek?

32:39.260 --> 32:40.260
And you don't have to answer.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.260
Wait, listen.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.740
Can we get Derek a mic?

32:42.740 --> 32:44.540
We have a crowd mic or you can come down here.

32:44.540 --> 32:45.540
He's up in the, I think he's up in the balcony.

32:45.540 --> 32:46.540
Wait, wait, wait.

32:46.540 --> 32:49.140
Derek, are you in the balcony or are you on the ground floor?

32:49.140 --> 32:50.140
Okay.

32:50.140 --> 32:51.140
Down here.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.140
Yeah.

32:52.140 --> 32:54.660
If we could get Derek, we have a crowd microphone or you can come down here and you can just

32:54.660 --> 32:55.660
talk into mine.

32:55.660 --> 32:56.660
Whatever.

32:56.660 --> 32:57.660
Derek, where are you friend?

32:57.660 --> 32:58.660
Cause I got it.

32:58.660 --> 33:02.820
We could, we could van, we could talk about whatever garbage we want to, but honestly

33:02.820 --> 33:05.500
we do need to know how this actually shook out.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.500
Okay.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.500
Hey Derek.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.220
Derek, my first, my first question for you is this.

33:10.220 --> 33:11.220
Yeah.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.660
How long did you stand there with the handle in your hand?

33:14.660 --> 33:15.660
That's actually a very good question.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.700
And how long was your, oh no.

33:19.700 --> 33:28.900
See, to be honest, I thought it had been hours as I was standing there, but it was probably

33:28.900 --> 33:30.540
just the mic close to your mouth there.

33:30.540 --> 33:31.540
I have to hear every single.

33:31.540 --> 33:38.860
But not too close, you'll ram it through your face with your incredible strength.

33:38.860 --> 33:42.220
I mean, we have so many suggestions of how you could have done it better, but I do want

33:42.220 --> 33:44.900
to know how this played out so badly.

33:44.900 --> 33:49.020
It was, I stood there long enough that I knew that people were going to start wondering,

33:49.020 --> 33:53.740
wow, he's taken a shower for a long time, which has other sort of sinister, which has

33:53.740 --> 33:54.740
other sinister.

33:54.740 --> 33:55.740
Correct.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.740
Correct.

33:56.740 --> 34:04.700
I was waiting and the handle fell off on the worst part is my friend had another friend

34:04.700 --> 34:07.340
had taken a shower before me and apparently figured it out.

34:07.340 --> 34:08.340
I guess it was fine.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.340
Hey bud.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.340
It doesn't sound like a real heart.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.340
It's not.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.340
Jigsaw puzzle.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.340
Right.

34:13.340 --> 34:16.820
How to not break the shower is not a tough one.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.460
How did you fucking cloak your shit?

34:18.460 --> 34:19.460
I don't know.

34:19.460 --> 34:30.940
Well, I, I FaceTimed my girlfriend and she was like, she was like, she was like, why

34:30.940 --> 34:31.940
are you in the shower?

34:31.940 --> 34:33.500
And I was like, there's no time.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
Yeah.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.160
I need help.

34:36.160 --> 34:41.980
So how did you get out of the situation and jumped through the phone?

34:41.980 --> 34:44.820
She was like, just go downstairs and explain and they'll understand.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.540
I was like, are you a crazy person?

34:46.540 --> 34:47.540
Yeah.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.020
I'm not at any sort of solution.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.500
No, that's not it.

34:50.500 --> 34:58.820
I texted my other friend downstairs, who's a plumber, what, what, what now?

34:58.820 --> 34:59.820
A plumber.

34:59.820 --> 35:00.820
There's a plumber.

35:00.820 --> 35:01.820
Your friend's a plumber.

35:01.820 --> 35:03.180
That's the only right answer.

35:03.180 --> 35:05.540
He turned, he figured out how to turn off the water.

35:05.540 --> 35:14.860
Well that's anti-climactic and his, apparently the bathroom was like his mom's like sanctuary

35:14.860 --> 35:18.260
area and I, she's never going to forgive me.

35:18.260 --> 35:19.260
Now it's got a waterfall.

35:19.260 --> 35:20.700
Enjoy your relaxation, Debra.

35:20.700 --> 35:21.700
Correct.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.620
I made it steamy permanently in there.

35:24.620 --> 35:25.620
Forever.

35:25.620 --> 35:26.620
Forever.

35:26.620 --> 35:30.480
So did you ever admit to it or did you figure out a way to reaffix the handle?

35:30.480 --> 35:35.460
I tried to fix the handle and it didn't work and I shamefully admitted to it.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.100
And now are you and your friend's mom like best friends?

35:38.100 --> 35:41.860
I don't know about best friends.

35:41.860 --> 35:44.460
Was she angry at you?

35:44.460 --> 35:45.460
She wasn't.

35:45.460 --> 35:46.460
You didn't do it on purpose.

35:46.460 --> 35:48.140
Derek, Derek, I don't want to lie here.

35:48.140 --> 35:51.940
How did Debra react to you breaking the shower?

35:51.940 --> 35:54.700
She was, she said it was okay, but it wasn't okay.

35:54.700 --> 35:55.700
Okay.

35:55.700 --> 35:56.700
Yes, he has.

35:56.700 --> 35:57.700
That's correct.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.700
Everybody, big hand for Derek, everyone.

35:58.700 --> 35:59.700
Well folks.

35:59.700 --> 36:06.980
One time, one time, one time we were in Florida and we were staying with our uncle Dave and

36:06.980 --> 36:11.180
uncle Dave was psyched about the new screen doors he had in his Florida house.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.740
Keep that in mind.

36:12.740 --> 36:16.220
I've probably told this story on the podcast before, but I saw a golf cart in his driveway

36:16.220 --> 36:17.940
and I got real excited.

36:17.940 --> 36:21.460
Also the video game Grand Theft Auto 3 had just come out.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.860
I saw the golf cart and I yelled, Grand Theft Auto.

36:23.860 --> 36:29.540
I jumped through the screen door and not on purpose, it wasn't like Griffin saw the screen

36:29.540 --> 36:31.060
door and thought, I'm going to jump through that.

36:31.060 --> 36:34.660
No, I saw the golf cart and I thought, Grand Theft Auto.

36:34.660 --> 36:40.580
I jumped through it and my uncle Dave said it was okay, but it was not okay.

36:40.580 --> 36:44.580
Folks, we are going to take a break during which time you can go relieve yourself, go

36:44.580 --> 36:45.580
refresh yourself.

36:45.580 --> 36:46.580
That's what we're going to do.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.580
Straight up.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.580
Got to purchase the posters.

36:48.580 --> 36:49.580
There's posters out in the lobby.

36:49.580 --> 36:51.060
Made by Steven Sugar.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.500
They're fucking beautiful and wonderful and we love them so much.

36:53.500 --> 36:59.060
So go buy those and get your questions ready and please have real questions and we love

36:59.060 --> 37:02.000
you very much and we will see you in a few minutes.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
We love you.

37:03.000 --> 37:15.660
Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy, Sweet Baby Brother.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.720
Thank you so much for listening to our live show.

37:17.720 --> 37:23.380
This was our show for Minneapolis from the Midwest tour that we just got back from yesterday.

37:23.380 --> 37:24.380
Sorry for the late episode.

37:24.380 --> 37:27.700
We were all traveling yesterday and so here it is today.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.580
If you came out to these shows, thank you so much.

37:29.580 --> 37:35.500
We had a lot of fun except for the part where, well, I'm about to do a stunt in the second

37:35.500 --> 37:36.500
half of this show.

37:36.500 --> 37:40.120
So if you hear a bit where everybody starts laughing at me for no reason, it's because

37:40.120 --> 37:42.540
of the very cool and very brave stunt.

37:42.540 --> 37:45.940
Anyway, I'm going to tell you about some of our advertisers and then let you get back

37:45.940 --> 37:47.080
to the rest of the show.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.740
Our first advertiser is Casper.

37:49.740 --> 37:54.060
Casper is a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create

37:54.060 --> 37:57.880
an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

37:57.880 --> 38:01.820
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman, sells directly to

38:01.820 --> 38:02.940
the customer.

38:02.940 --> 38:08.140
We have a Casper mattress in our guest room and nursery and it is really, really comfortable.

38:08.140 --> 38:12.580
I've slept on it a few times and whenever we've had guests over who've slept in the

38:12.580 --> 38:14.660
bed, we get rave reviews.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.660
Four stars.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.660
Out of four.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.900
That's a 100% perfect score.

38:18.900 --> 38:24.300
Anyway, Casper brand mattresses combine multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep

38:24.300 --> 38:28.060
surface with the right amount of both sink and bounce.

38:28.060 --> 38:32.220
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.220
Start sleeping ahead of the curve with Casper.

38:34.220 --> 38:39.180
Get $50 towards any mattress purchase by going to Casper.com slash my brother and using promo

38:39.180 --> 38:40.580

38:40.580 --> 38:43.780
Terms and conditions, they do apply.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.460
I also want to tell you about Lyft.

38:45.460 --> 38:48.380
That's L-Y-F-T, the ride sharing service.

38:48.380 --> 38:51.240
Lyft drivers can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.

38:51.240 --> 38:56.360
In fact, Lyft was the first ride share program with tipping built right into the app.

38:56.360 --> 39:01.800
As a driver, you keep 100% of the tips and happy drivers means happy passengers.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.700
You can join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better.

39:05.700 --> 39:12.460
Just go to Lyft.com slash brother today and you can also get a $500 new driver bonus.

39:12.460 --> 39:14.260
That's Lyft.com slash brother.

39:14.260 --> 39:15.260
One last time.

39:15.260 --> 39:21.340
Lyft.com slash brother, limited time only, terms, they also apply here.

39:21.340 --> 39:22.980
I have a Jumbotron message.

39:22.980 --> 39:28.860
This one is for Future Justin and it's from Past Justin who says, Dear Future Justin,

39:28.860 --> 39:30.700
congrats on getting the hell out of the Navy.

39:30.700 --> 39:34.580
I hope you aren't wasting it with that dank kush and video games.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.220
I hope you are.

39:36.220 --> 39:38.340
Get out there and do some good for this world.

39:38.340 --> 39:39.340
P.S.

39:39.340 --> 39:42.700
I bet you wish you had these 100 smackers right now, don't you?

39:42.700 --> 39:43.740
Too bad.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.580
You should have talked me out of it.

39:45.580 --> 39:46.580
Suck it, Past Justin.

39:46.580 --> 39:52.740
I don't know if this is our first Jumbotron to feature a prominent suck it and a self

39:52.740 --> 39:56.620
suck it too, which is impressive.

39:56.620 --> 40:04.340
But yeah, hey, current, present Justin, get out there and be the change, I think.

40:04.340 --> 40:05.580
Here's another Jumbotron message.

40:05.580 --> 40:08.780
This one is for Band, spelled B-E-R-N-D.

40:08.780 --> 40:13.180
There's some helpful pronunciation tips here as well as the information that he's Austrian

40:13.180 --> 40:19.860
so and that helpful tidbit comes from Amanda who says, pretend for a second this is the

40:19.860 --> 40:24.740
adventure zone where it would be more fitting for me to commemorate and thank you for our

40:24.740 --> 40:29.860
many adventures together from pillow fort snuggles to exercising you in the park.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.340
To exercising you in the park?

40:31.340 --> 40:34.940
Do you mean doing exercise or to get a demon anyway?

40:34.940 --> 40:37.260
To not dying on your motorcycle.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.900
Smell you later.

40:39.900 --> 40:43.380
Or ideally sooner, maybe on my side of the pond this time.

40:43.380 --> 40:47.780
That is a very sweet message and I'm sorry you couldn't get it on adventure zone.

40:47.780 --> 40:52.500
It's a very competitive market right now and with the economy the way it is, something,

40:52.500 --> 40:54.980
something, something, the economy.

40:54.980 --> 40:55.980
I think that's it.

40:55.980 --> 40:58.360
We sure do appreciate you listening to the episode.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.780
We are gonna try really hard to get a new episode recorded for next Monday so we don't

41:01.780 --> 41:06.300
do two live shows back to back again but with the holiday this weekend and folks are traveling,

41:06.300 --> 41:10.860
I'm not 100% on that but we're gonna try really, really hard to get a new episode for you next

41:10.860 --> 41:12.220
Monday.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.220
I think that's it.

41:13.220 --> 41:20.900
Oh, so when we come back after the promo for our fellow MaxFun podcast here after the break,

41:20.900 --> 41:24.820
we lost a little bit of the recording but we are just gonna jump right into the middle

41:24.820 --> 41:29.980
of a, spoiler alert, a haunted doll watch and it's a very good haunted doll watch and

41:29.980 --> 41:33.700
we hope you enjoy it and we'll talk to you next Monday, bye.

41:33.700 --> 41:34.700
I'm Bez.

41:34.700 --> 41:35.700
And I'm Teresa.

41:35.700 --> 41:38.740
And we host the weekly comedy podcast, One Bad Mother.

41:38.740 --> 41:41.260
We celebrate our moments of parenting genius.

41:41.260 --> 41:42.260
As well as our failures.

41:42.260 --> 41:47.260
Just like, we're gonna have hot dogs and I'm like, no, we're having fun, everybody loves

41:47.260 --> 41:50.700
hot dogs and it just like smashes that thing right on my chest and then I'm just crying

41:50.700 --> 41:54.500
in the middle of like kids space while people are like literally dancing with their children.

41:54.500 --> 41:58.020
Parenting can be sad and painfully funny at the same time.

41:58.020 --> 42:03.100
So join us each week as we admit that this is hard but we're getting really good at it.

42:03.100 --> 42:09.460
Visit us at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.340
How tall is the doll again, Juice in inches?

42:11.340 --> 42:12.340
48 inches.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.220
That's a lot of inches, holy shit, okay.

42:14.220 --> 42:16.300
That's a lot of doll.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.820
She's from the 1800s, uncertain of exact year.

42:19.820 --> 42:22.580
She sustained a foot injury from a bad fall.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.780
Your doll broke.

42:24.780 --> 42:26.980
It wasn't injured.

42:26.980 --> 42:29.140
Wait, no, this is important.

42:29.140 --> 42:31.620
When they say from the 18th century, the doll.

42:31.620 --> 42:32.620
The doll of the ghost.

42:32.620 --> 42:33.620
I don't know.

42:33.620 --> 42:36.660
Her foot remained broken and it is the same to this day.

42:36.660 --> 42:42.300
So translation, the doll's foot did break and I did not fix it.

42:42.300 --> 42:45.820
You cannot notice due to her beautiful long Victorian dress.

42:45.820 --> 42:46.820
Oh, I'll notice.

42:46.820 --> 42:49.340
The doll's foot is broken, I didn't fix it but you won't notice.

42:49.340 --> 42:50.340
But it's cool.

42:50.340 --> 42:55.620
You're not gonna bring this on Haunted Antiques Roadshow and they're gonna miss the foot.

42:55.620 --> 43:00.740
I always suggest leave a vessel as is for there's a reason and you'll upset her.

43:00.740 --> 43:01.740
You're lazy.

43:01.740 --> 43:03.700
Well, here's the thing.

43:03.700 --> 43:08.420
My worry is with the broken foot, the ghost is just gonna leak out the bottom.

43:08.420 --> 43:15.580
You can hear her roam the hall and hear her drag her foot.

43:15.580 --> 43:17.780
Now you're building it into the character.

43:17.780 --> 43:18.780
And you know what?

43:18.780 --> 43:19.780
It's better because her foot's broken.

43:19.780 --> 43:21.780
It's even better than other ones you have.

43:21.780 --> 43:24.660
I broke it on purpose.

43:24.660 --> 43:28.660
She may enter your bedroom at night and touch your face.

43:28.660 --> 43:32.940
Okay, what's great about this is y'all reacted.

43:32.940 --> 43:34.100
She won't.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.100
She won't.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.100
It's a doll.

43:36.100 --> 43:39.020
But y'all were like, well, no, no, up till now.

43:39.020 --> 43:40.020
She might.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.300
It gets better.

43:41.300 --> 43:54.100
She may enter your bedroom at night, touch your face, it will feel like a spiderweb.

43:54.100 --> 44:00.260
Is that better or worse than it feeling like a haunted small porcelain hand?

44:00.260 --> 44:02.020
It will feel like a spiderweb.

44:02.020 --> 44:06.340
Also, in what way?

44:06.340 --> 44:11.460
Very lightly because she is captivated by human life form to a wild way of phrasing

44:11.460 --> 44:12.460
that.

44:12.460 --> 44:17.140
Actually, it's just her going, fix my foot, please.

44:17.140 --> 44:18.500
She has such great beauty.

44:18.500 --> 44:23.220
She could have any man she wanted and was lucky with love.

44:23.220 --> 44:28.540
But don't let me read this entire sentence because you're going to be very tempted to

44:28.540 --> 44:29.540
get in here.

44:29.540 --> 44:32.260
Please let me read the entire sentence.

44:32.260 --> 44:39.740
Her witchy ways, her beautiful eyes, her hair, clothing, jewelry and her body lifelike.

44:39.740 --> 44:44.820
She is a designer doll and has real looking breasts.

44:44.820 --> 44:56.700
I have never owned a vessel or doll that looked like this, meaning real.

44:56.700 --> 45:01.380
She is shown on the Victorian couch in the same old house I found her and where I heard

45:01.380 --> 45:02.380
her cries.

45:02.380 --> 45:06.060
I can't believe there's more.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.400
Her clothing alone is very expensive.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.980
Also to mention her true to life look and build.

45:10.980 --> 45:11.980
She is a true companion.

45:11.980 --> 45:12.980
We get it.

45:12.980 --> 45:13.980
We get it.

45:13.980 --> 45:14.980
It's a fucking thing.

45:14.980 --> 45:15.980
It's a fuck thing.

45:15.980 --> 45:16.980
You want to fuck a ghost.

45:16.980 --> 45:17.980
We get it.

45:17.980 --> 45:19.980
Have I made it clear?

45:19.980 --> 45:21.580
Exquisite.

45:21.580 --> 45:25.780
This is one of three that I have and decided to let her go to another good home.

45:25.780 --> 45:27.860
That's a cool house you have.

45:27.860 --> 45:30.880
What a cool, enjoyable house you have to live in.

45:30.880 --> 45:34.060
She has many talents and can help you with most anything.

45:34.060 --> 45:35.780
They're not fucking automatons.

45:35.780 --> 45:38.580
You don't get one of these fucking things for sweeping, right?

45:38.580 --> 45:42.620
Do you think at this point like his wife walked in like, what are you typing?

45:42.620 --> 45:46.420
Like, I'm selling you, dear.

45:46.420 --> 45:47.540
She is very active.

45:47.540 --> 45:49.220
Once again, I warn you.

45:49.220 --> 45:50.220
Once you look into her eyes.

45:50.220 --> 45:51.220
Very sexy.

45:51.220 --> 45:52.220
I got to warn you.

45:52.220 --> 45:54.320
Once you look into her eyes, you will be captured by her beauty.

45:54.320 --> 45:57.100
She is breathtaking.

45:57.100 --> 46:00.140
I know once you see her, you will want her.

46:00.140 --> 46:02.400
Holy shit.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.660
If she is meant for you, she will stay in your mind and perhaps she will enter your

46:05.660 --> 46:10.940
dreams and you will not get her off your mind, man or woman.

46:10.940 --> 46:19.220
I feel like we started a bit at the beginning of this read and this person heard us do that

46:19.220 --> 46:25.020
and they decided to yes and however many weeks ago, yes and us with their doll.

46:25.020 --> 46:28.420
I just hope that three brothers read this listing.

46:28.420 --> 46:31.620
Once again, she is true to size.

46:31.620 --> 46:35.060
A four foot per, I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah, sure.

46:35.060 --> 46:40.740
Beautiful clothing, glass eyes, beautiful jewelry made of porcelain, vintage.

46:40.740 --> 46:42.300
Just like a human being.

46:42.300 --> 46:49.500
Real clothing, glass eyes, glass eyes, beautiful jewelry made of porcelain, vintage and her

46:49.500 --> 46:50.660
defective foot.

46:50.660 --> 46:51.660
You cannot see it.

46:51.660 --> 46:58.760
Made of porcelain, vintage and her defective foot, but you cannot see it.

46:58.760 --> 47:05.060
You will not notice her foot, but you will notice her breasts.

47:05.060 --> 47:06.060
God in heaven.

47:06.060 --> 47:07.060
She is one of a kind.

47:07.060 --> 47:08.060
For sure.

47:08.060 --> 47:10.780
She's one of three, it sounds like.

47:10.780 --> 47:13.140
The other two's feets ain't breaking.

47:13.140 --> 47:17.420
Whoa, that sentence was bad.

47:17.420 --> 47:20.700
I want you to really listen to me for this next paragraph, okay?

47:20.700 --> 47:21.700
Really listen.

47:21.700 --> 47:22.700
I can't, Justin.

47:22.700 --> 47:25.820
It's the end, but I want you to like really think about it.

47:25.820 --> 47:28.260
She is one of a kind for sure.

47:28.260 --> 47:31.460
Ask yourself, do you want her?

47:31.460 --> 47:33.700
Do you need her?

47:33.700 --> 47:36.180
Do you want love?

47:36.180 --> 47:39.780
Only you will know, she is sold as is and beautiful.

47:39.780 --> 47:52.260
So that's the haunted doll watch for this week.

47:52.260 --> 47:56.900
We can never do this bit again.

47:56.900 --> 48:00.820
You all may have just heard the last haunted doll watch.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.260
What a momentous occasion.

48:02.260 --> 48:08.380
I can't imagine a doll watch better than, listen, this doll's super haunted and super

48:08.380 --> 48:09.380
stacked.

48:09.380 --> 48:10.380
Check it.

48:10.380 --> 48:11.380
Check it.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.500
You won't even notice the foot.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.820
Can I tell you the terrible truth?

48:16.820 --> 48:20.500
I read the first paragraph of that and thought, yeah, it seems good.

48:20.500 --> 48:25.300
It's a Babe Ruth called shot, pointed the outfield.

48:25.300 --> 48:26.300
Okay.

48:26.300 --> 48:28.900
All right, we're going to start picking people for this part.

48:28.900 --> 48:31.900
Please stay in your seats and be cool.

48:31.900 --> 48:35.900
If you could lower us, like our lights about 30% so we can see and bring those house lights

48:35.900 --> 48:37.260
just all the way up.

48:37.260 --> 48:39.820
Because it's real hard to find people sometimes.

48:39.820 --> 48:40.820
Yeah.

48:40.820 --> 48:42.580
Just give me a full house.

48:42.580 --> 48:43.580
Okay.

48:43.580 --> 48:47.860
God, there are like, there's a lot of people in here.

48:47.860 --> 48:51.980
If we could get even more house and less us, it would help us because right now I just

48:51.980 --> 48:53.140
see sort of a bunch of overcast faces.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.820
I know that you are not normally tasked with illuminating the audience.

48:56.820 --> 48:59.220
That's not really what the lights are built for.

48:59.220 --> 49:03.820
Um, okay, this person here with, I think it's a green long sleeve shirt.

49:03.820 --> 49:04.820
It looks like.

49:04.820 --> 49:05.820
Yeah.

49:05.820 --> 49:07.860
And yeah, you, where should that, sorry.

49:07.860 --> 49:08.860
Where are the microphones?

49:08.860 --> 49:09.860
Where should they go to?

49:09.860 --> 49:12.420
Once they, uh, there's one on the right, one on the left.

49:12.420 --> 49:13.420
Uh, okay.

49:13.420 --> 49:19.900
Over on this side, uh, there's somebody with a white, uh, short sleeve shirt that's bouncing

49:19.900 --> 49:20.900
up and down and you're celebrating.

49:20.900 --> 49:21.900
You're standing.

49:21.900 --> 49:22.900
Yes.

49:22.900 --> 49:23.900
Yes.

49:23.900 --> 49:24.900
You.

49:24.900 --> 49:25.900
Yes.

49:25.900 --> 49:26.900
You.

49:26.900 --> 49:27.900
You just sit up and celebrate.

49:27.900 --> 49:28.900
Sit down.

49:28.900 --> 49:29.900
Right there.

49:29.900 --> 49:30.900
Right there.

49:30.900 --> 49:31.900
Code to the microphone.

49:31.900 --> 49:32.900
Oh, you're worrying me already.

49:32.900 --> 49:33.900
Okay.

49:33.900 --> 49:37.460
I seem like you also have already begun to hear are the rules.

49:37.460 --> 49:42.100
Um, we're going to hear your name and hear your question and it's going to be a question

49:42.100 --> 49:43.100
that we can help with.

49:43.100 --> 49:49.180
Remember the funny story that ends with your last chance to sit down and, uh, we will choose

49:49.180 --> 49:54.700
the one that we can help the most, not the best anecdote about whatever, just the one

49:54.700 --> 49:55.700
we can help the most.

49:55.700 --> 49:56.700
Okay.

49:56.700 --> 49:58.860
And also if we don't pick yours, it doesn't mean your question wasn't good.

49:58.860 --> 49:59.860
No.

49:59.860 --> 50:02.340
It just means that we can't help you because we're dinguses.

50:02.340 --> 50:03.340
Yeah.

50:03.340 --> 50:04.340
Uh, let's start over here.

50:04.340 --> 50:05.340
Hi, what's your name?

50:05.340 --> 50:06.340
Uh, hi, my name's Ryan.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.340
Hi, Ryan.

50:07.340 --> 50:08.340
What's your question, Ryan?

50:08.340 --> 50:14.220
Uh, so my dad won't stop, uh, texting me animated gifts and then asking me for my feedback in

50:14.220 --> 50:15.220
person.

50:15.220 --> 50:22.620
And I don't know what to say to him.

50:22.620 --> 50:23.620
Okay.

50:23.620 --> 50:29.140
That one's very simple, but relatable.

50:29.140 --> 50:30.140
That's very good.

50:30.140 --> 50:31.140
Uh, what is it?

50:31.140 --> 50:32.140
Is that, that's the end?

50:32.140 --> 50:33.140
Okay.

50:33.140 --> 50:34.140
That's the end of the question.

50:34.140 --> 50:35.140
What's your name and your question?

50:35.140 --> 50:36.140
Danielle.

50:36.140 --> 50:37.140
Hi, Danielle.

50:37.140 --> 50:38.140
Sorry.

50:38.140 --> 50:39.140
Yeah.

50:39.140 --> 50:40.140
It amplifies it.

50:40.140 --> 50:41.140
Yeah.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.140
Shoots it all over this big room.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.140
Even louder.

50:43.140 --> 50:44.140
Yeah.

50:44.140 --> 50:45.140
Uh, what is your question, Danielle?

50:45.140 --> 50:49.100
Um, I work in a nice restaurant and, uh, in an ice restaurant, a nice restaurant, nice

50:49.100 --> 50:50.100
restaurant.

50:50.100 --> 50:51.100
Okay.

50:51.100 --> 50:55.020
I don't do anything besides stick a candle in the desserts, but sometimes I'm asked to

50:55.020 --> 50:58.780
sing because I am studying to be a professional singer.

50:58.780 --> 50:59.780
Okay.

50:59.780 --> 51:00.780
Shit.

51:00.780 --> 51:07.220
So, so sometimes I sing for a guest, but sometimes it's during rush and the entire floor gets

51:07.220 --> 51:08.220
quiet.

51:08.220 --> 51:12.060
And then the next guest wants me to sing happy birthday too.

51:12.060 --> 51:16.380
So how do I stop the chain of snowballing happy birthdays?

51:16.380 --> 51:22.300
Ah, listen, y'all, both your lives are ruined.

51:22.300 --> 51:25.580
We're going to be sorting through rubble either way.

51:25.580 --> 51:27.220
Damn.

51:27.220 --> 51:28.780
These are both really good.

51:28.780 --> 51:29.780
Yeah.

51:29.780 --> 51:30.780
That's really good.

51:30.780 --> 51:32.300
Let's, can we help out?

51:32.300 --> 51:33.300
We can help out.

51:33.300 --> 51:39.260
Cause I think we can help you very fast, very fast.

51:39.260 --> 51:44.260
I don't actually, I was hoping you could.

51:44.260 --> 52:07.980
I'm sorry if you're, if you're listening at home

52:07.980 --> 52:18.460
if you're listening at home, I just did a finishing joke to Griffin.

52:18.460 --> 52:26.420
A very big bee got on the stage and went for my beloved brother Travis.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.220
Just deathly allergic.

52:28.220 --> 52:34.860
I fought the bee and I won, but I farted while I was doing it.

52:34.860 --> 52:35.860
That's right.

52:35.860 --> 52:36.860
Everybody laughed very big.

52:36.860 --> 52:37.860
Griffin fell.

52:37.860 --> 52:43.860
Griffin fell slowly and of his own accord.

52:43.860 --> 52:44.860
Okay.

52:44.860 --> 52:45.860
Okay.

52:45.860 --> 52:46.860
Paul.

52:46.860 --> 52:51.060
Earlier, Paul, earlier you offered me ibuprofen backstage.

52:51.060 --> 52:56.380
I would love some right now.

52:56.380 --> 52:59.540
Okay.

52:59.540 --> 53:00.540
I think what you.

53:00.540 --> 53:07.040
I bought you two dipshits a lot of time to think of a good answer.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.740
So dad texts you a gift.

53:09.740 --> 53:14.620
You then, when you see him next, I want you unprompted to pull out a legal pad that you

53:14.620 --> 53:17.420
have seven pages of notes applied.

53:17.420 --> 53:21.660
And I want you to go beat by beat methodically and go, and another thing I think you could

53:21.660 --> 53:26.380
do better with your gifts and really get in there.

53:26.380 --> 53:28.200
Tell your dad he's ready for Tumblr.

53:28.200 --> 53:32.140
Say these are great gifts and I'm ready for you to start Tumblr.

53:32.140 --> 53:33.540
Then get the link to the Tumblr.

53:33.540 --> 53:36.340
Then send me the link to enjoy your dad's gifts.

53:36.340 --> 53:38.100
I hope that helps you very much.

53:38.100 --> 53:47.220
Thank you.

53:47.220 --> 53:50.500
Three fucking ibuprofen, Paul.

53:50.500 --> 53:51.500
Let's party.

53:51.500 --> 53:54.700
This is our fucking behind the music, Griffin.

53:54.700 --> 53:56.420
Things went bad for Griffin.

53:56.420 --> 53:58.100
Things already went bad for Griffin.

53:58.100 --> 53:59.800
He fought the big bean.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.540
He found his vertigo unable to control.

54:02.540 --> 54:06.740
He turned to using drugs on stage.

54:06.740 --> 54:12.380
So people make you sing.

54:12.380 --> 54:18.780
Can you get some sort of hose peripheral that you just put right up here and then lead directly

54:18.780 --> 54:24.740
to their mouth, their ear or their mouth.

54:24.740 --> 54:27.420
And feed them cake like a mama bird.

54:27.420 --> 54:32.820
I would do the, if Mariah Carey would sing into a hose into my mouth and then make it

54:32.820 --> 54:37.100
sing like I was singing her beautiful voice.

54:37.100 --> 54:41.300
My head's not going to work good for the rest of them.

54:41.300 --> 54:45.300
I actually, I miss, because I see this in movies all the time and TV shows and I've

54:45.300 --> 54:49.940
never seen it happen in real life, like the piano just in the middle of the thing and

54:49.940 --> 54:55.060
like a singer who just like, not like a band that performs, but just like that's what this

54:55.060 --> 54:58.460
restaurant is and everyone's there apparently to see this happen.

54:58.460 --> 55:03.780
So I say you just lean into it and he just like, this happy birthday song is for everybody.

55:03.780 --> 55:07.420
Full blown la la land.

55:07.420 --> 55:08.420
No that sucks.

55:08.420 --> 55:11.740
But the song I sing is only happy birthday?

55:11.740 --> 55:12.740
Well does it have to be?

55:12.740 --> 55:16.020
You're going to have to do your own spin on it, right, where you just like make it really

55:16.020 --> 55:17.860
long because that's what people love.

55:17.860 --> 55:22.860
When the birthday song goes on forever and people are like, yeah more, keep going, slower.

55:22.860 --> 55:26.900
Sing the secret second verse of the happy birthday song.

55:26.900 --> 55:29.620
All the extra stuff with like Scooby Doo and all that.

55:29.620 --> 55:30.620
Oh yeah.

55:30.620 --> 55:31.620
Exactly.

55:31.620 --> 55:32.620
Yeah, and more.

55:32.620 --> 55:35.060
But make it last like seven minutes long.

55:35.060 --> 55:36.860
Nobody will want to hear that again I feel like.

55:36.860 --> 55:38.420
Oh, I got it.

55:38.420 --> 55:39.860
Start offering people a choice.

55:39.860 --> 55:43.860
They can have a free dessert or the song, but not both.

55:43.860 --> 55:46.940
You'll never have to sing the song.

55:46.940 --> 55:53.540
Can you get someone to come out and like put a cape on you after like James Brown used

55:53.540 --> 55:54.540
to?

55:54.540 --> 55:55.540
Like, no, she can't sing anymore.

55:55.540 --> 55:56.540
She can't.

55:56.540 --> 55:57.780
Listen, you heard it.

55:57.780 --> 55:58.780
We put the cape on.

55:58.780 --> 55:59.780
It's over.

55:59.780 --> 56:00.780
That's the end of it.

56:00.780 --> 56:01.780
We need that by the way.

56:01.780 --> 56:03.620
I would love that.

56:03.620 --> 56:06.900
Or a neck brace.

56:06.900 --> 56:07.900
Did we help?

56:07.900 --> 56:08.900
Yes.

56:08.900 --> 56:09.900
Thank you.

56:09.900 --> 56:10.900
Thank you.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.900
Nice.

56:11.900 --> 56:22.980
All right, let's go more middle this time.

56:22.980 --> 56:26.740
Somebody has a top hat over here.

56:26.740 --> 56:28.220
Sorry, this top hat.

56:28.220 --> 56:32.340
The fact that multiple people applauded for the top hat is like, what's up my brother,

56:32.340 --> 56:33.340
my brother, my listeners.

56:33.340 --> 56:34.340
Go left.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.340
Yeah, stage left.

56:35.340 --> 56:36.340
Okay, right here.

56:36.340 --> 56:37.340
This way, this way, this way.

56:37.340 --> 56:38.340
Yeah, you got it.

56:38.340 --> 56:39.340
Right here, you're wearing glasses.

56:39.340 --> 56:43.860
You're here to have a blue shirt that perhaps is denim and maybe yes, please stand up.

56:43.860 --> 56:44.860
Yes, it's you.

56:44.860 --> 56:45.860
Yes.

56:45.860 --> 56:46.860
Come on down.

56:46.860 --> 56:47.860
All right, you're stage right.

56:47.860 --> 56:48.860
You're wearing glasses.

56:48.860 --> 56:52.420
That was the worst injury we sustained during a live show before, right?

56:52.420 --> 56:54.860
Easily top five, at the very least.

56:54.860 --> 56:57.020
Oh, shit.

56:57.020 --> 57:00.580
That's not just any top hat.

57:00.580 --> 57:05.540
Your cosplaying is Griffin from episode two of my brother, my brother and me.

57:05.540 --> 57:07.380
Now available on VRV.com.

57:07.380 --> 57:08.380
VRV.co.

57:08.380 --> 57:12.500
All six episodes available.

57:12.500 --> 57:13.940
That fucking rules.

57:13.940 --> 57:18.180
It's really good.

57:18.180 --> 57:19.380
What is your name?

57:19.380 --> 57:20.380
My name is Anna.

57:20.380 --> 57:21.380
Hi Anna.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.820
And Anna, what is your question?

57:23.820 --> 57:28.980
I work at a job that I hate and I want to quit, but I can't get my vacation benefits

57:28.980 --> 57:31.380
until I hit a year and that's six weeks away.

57:31.380 --> 57:32.380
Okay.

57:32.380 --> 57:36.860
And my boss, I think senses this and is trying to like get me to quit before then by being

57:36.860 --> 57:39.580
like, you seem really unhappy.

57:39.580 --> 57:43.980
So how do I beat her?

57:43.980 --> 57:44.980
I love that.

57:44.980 --> 57:46.540
We don't get the adversarial ones enough.

57:46.540 --> 57:47.540
That's awesome, Anna.

57:47.540 --> 57:48.540
Thank you.

57:48.540 --> 57:49.540
What is your name?

57:49.540 --> 57:50.540
I'm Katie.

57:50.540 --> 57:51.540
Hi Katie.

57:51.540 --> 57:52.540
Who are you trying to thwart?

57:52.540 --> 57:53.540
Security here.

57:53.540 --> 58:02.020
No, we have, my boyfriend got us a season tickets to the Broadway shows that come here.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.020
Okay.

58:03.020 --> 58:05.920
And our seats are actually where we're sitting tonight, which is convenient.

58:05.920 --> 58:12.620
Because my question is what is the best way to hide snacks here for when we come to the

58:12.620 --> 58:13.620
show?

58:13.620 --> 58:14.620
Yes.

58:14.620 --> 58:15.620
In the chandelier.

58:15.620 --> 58:16.620
Hypothetically.

58:16.620 --> 58:26.100
I want to do that one just so I can reference heavyweights a lot.

58:26.100 --> 58:27.100
Anna thank you so much.

58:27.100 --> 58:29.180
I don't think we can help you enough.

58:29.180 --> 58:30.660
Just like, just like chill.

58:30.660 --> 58:31.660
That one's easy though.

58:31.660 --> 58:32.660
Just like chill.

58:32.660 --> 58:33.800
Chill and don't get fired, Anna.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.800
You can do it.

58:34.800 --> 58:38.540
I'll play out without last.

58:38.540 --> 58:40.020
Right.

58:40.020 --> 58:46.220
So your first order of business is going to be disguised because you have been spotted

58:46.220 --> 58:47.700
by the theater officers.

58:47.700 --> 58:49.140
They have your name.

58:49.140 --> 58:50.140
I'm looking.

58:50.140 --> 58:51.140
Yes.

58:51.140 --> 58:53.020
They're putting your picture on a bulletin board.

58:53.020 --> 58:57.700
Listen, the first obvious choice is going to be like slid open the seat.

58:57.700 --> 58:58.700
So the canning.

58:58.700 --> 58:59.700
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

58:59.700 --> 59:00.700
This is a mistake.

59:00.700 --> 59:01.700
But don't do that.

59:01.700 --> 59:02.700
This is a mistake for a lot of reasons.

59:02.700 --> 59:05.340
First of all, you're going to put your butt on your food.

59:05.340 --> 59:06.780
Like this is not great.

59:06.780 --> 59:10.180
But also there's a lovely theater you shouldn't go to.

59:10.180 --> 59:13.300
Maybe just like tape it to the bottom of the seat.

59:13.300 --> 59:17.260
I know that's pretty easy, but is that cool?

59:17.260 --> 59:18.260
I'm looking around at the security.

59:18.260 --> 59:19.260
Do y'all check for it?

59:19.260 --> 59:20.260
No, no, no.

59:20.260 --> 59:21.980
I'm going to, I'm going to begin to shake it head no.

59:21.980 --> 59:22.980
All right.

59:22.980 --> 59:23.980
But serious questions.

59:23.980 --> 59:24.980
Security forces.

59:24.980 --> 59:25.980
Do y'all actually check for that?

59:25.980 --> 59:26.980
They're shaking head yes.

59:26.980 --> 59:27.980
Wow.

59:27.980 --> 59:28.980
That's thorough team.

59:28.980 --> 59:33.020
What don't you check for?

59:33.020 --> 59:34.020
Yeah.

59:34.020 --> 59:39.020
I almost fell over again.

59:39.020 --> 59:42.840
Oh, hell no.

59:42.840 --> 59:43.840
Now it's real.

59:43.840 --> 59:45.820
Now there's nothing holding up your back.

59:45.820 --> 59:46.820
Right.

59:46.820 --> 59:50.340
But my instinct won't be to lean back anymore.

59:50.340 --> 59:54.940
Can you give Katie some sort of like pass, some sort of snack, all you can eat snack

59:54.940 --> 59:55.940
pass.

59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.620
How much would they have to bribe you before you let them bring bribery bribery.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.620
Yeah.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.620
Okay.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.620
Okay.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.620
But like one snack for you, one snack for them kind of thing.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.620
You know what I mean?

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.620
Would that work?

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.620
No.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.620
I'm seeing a shaking head.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.620
No.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.620
Again.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.620
That's another no.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:15.140
You haven't had like you were a kid that if they bribe a Mars bar, holy shit.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:25.900
I don't know why I'm focusing on just, I mean, could you borrow their top hat?

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.820
Cause that's just a lot of snack potential.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:34.140
You could get four summer sausages up in that thing.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.140
Just four.

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140
I mean maybe more summer sausages depending.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:42.660
I mean, if you go full Jamiroquai, we're talking about eight to nine summer sausages.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:48.940
What you need to do is tape the snacks now to the seats now, but don't eat them now later.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.940
Pick them up.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.300
So they're already there waiting for you.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.100
Your seats are saved, right?

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.540
Just magnet them to there like people do with the car keys.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.940
And can I recommend now and laters?

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.780
Perhaps a now and later or something non-perishable along those lines.

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.420
Or maybe like tape them to your body, you know, like.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.380
I don't think that there's a good retrieval path for that.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.380
That is true.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.380
In the middle of it.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:18.340
Do you hear the people sing this song?

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.340
Does that help?

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:24.340
We'll see you in two weeks when we come back for that.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.340
Thank you.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:31.620
I'm going to turn my chair back around now because this is deeply uncomfortable.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:35.100
Could you convince them that it's a Rocky Horror kind of thing?

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:39.460
Like every time we see songs for a new world, we throw Raisinets at this one part.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.460
So I got to bring them in.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.500
I bet Sigourney would be like, oh, cool.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.540
We love when you throw stuff at the stage.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540
So good.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.540
All right.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.540
Okay.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.780
Let's go.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.140
Remember you really everybody's doing good so far.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.140
Let's keep the streak alive.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.940
There's a person with a red toboggan pointing at somebody else.

01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:58.940
Yeah.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.860
You like, I don't know, like 10 rows back.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.860
Yeah.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.660
You just took your toboggan off and now you're pointing at somebody.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:04.660
Yeah.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.660
You're pointing at yourself.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.660
There we go.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.660
This is the most.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.660
You are stage left.

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.620
And then on the right side.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.620
Okay.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.620
Right there.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.060
I think you have on a pink, pink shirt and you have like, yeah, you just turned your

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.060
head to look behind.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.060
Yes, you.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.060
Yes, you.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.060
You're pointing at your own face.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.300
We should have started with you already 30 seconds ago.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.300
Sorry.

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.020
My name is Becky.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.340
Hi Becky.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.540
My question is if you could give me advice on good topic starters when I'm meeting new

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.460
people because I was told the ones I do are inappropriate.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.940
Well, I got to hear, well, well, no, hold those hostage.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.940
Don't tell us.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940
Don't tell us.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:43.940
Okay.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.940
Make us ask for it.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:49.900
Give me a sneak preview of their viability for a podcast that people listen to.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.700
I misunderstood what goes into a prostate exam.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.460
All right, all right, all right, all right.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.620
I think we're going to get along great.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.620
What is your name?

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.620
Violet.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:04.620
Violet.

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.620
Hi.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620
Get right up on that mic.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.620
Violet.

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620
Okay.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620
Thank you.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:13.660
Oh, what is your question, Violet?

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:19.580
So I got a new roommate this year and it's fine, but she has a lot of cups and mugs in

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.740
assorted drinking devices.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.960
Like I counted, it's about 30.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960
It takes up-

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.360
Can we bring Violet's mic up just a little bit because I need to hear a lot more about

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.460
cups and mugs.

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.660
It takes up two of our shelves in the cabinet.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:39.180
I only own two mugs and they barely fit.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.180
Yeah.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.740
What do I do to these mugs?

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.900
How should I get rid of her cups or-

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900
Okay.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900
All right.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.220
I love that one very much.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.740
Real quick.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.700
How do you think a prostate exam works?

01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.020
And then we're going to do a deep dive on the mugs.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.140
Do you know the phrase, I hope he has small hands?

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.140
Okay.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.140
Yeah.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.780
I presume that because they're talking about the whole hand.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.780
Oh my God.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.780
The whole hand.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.780
Oh God.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.140
Like a muppet scenario?

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.140
Yeah.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.140
Okay.

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.140
Thank you very much.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:18.340
You're a wonderful person and I'm glad you're on earth.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:28.500
They have to check the weight of the prostate and the ripeness.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.500
Not ready yet.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.500
Okay.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:34.340
So my first question is why do you still own two mugs?

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.900
Because it sounds like you're good.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:40.140
Sounds like you could probably get rid of those pretty easily to start with.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.620
How novel are the mugs?

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.620
Yeah.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.620
Is that like a mug collection?

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:44.620
My mugs or her mugs?

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.620
Whose mugs?

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.620
Their mugs.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.060
If they have 30 mugs, they must love all.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.420
There's a story behind each one.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:55.620
No, I think she just picked them up at yard sales and then the rest are like Facebook

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.740
mom quotes about coffee.

01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.740
Okay.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:59.740
Fuck.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.740
Oh boy.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:01.740
Um, okay.

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.940
Are there any that are duplicates that she has more than one of?

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.940
No.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.940
God damn it.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.940
All original.

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.620
What if those were, I was going to shatter those.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.780
You were going to shatter those.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.780
You know what?

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.780
Here's the problem.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.780
They're not like in one space on two shelves.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.780
Yes.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.340
Two mugs spread throughout the kitchen.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.740
Just mugs everywhere.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.940
But just enough that if someone looks in one cabinet, they're like, that's an appropriate

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.300
amount of mugs.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:30.100
Unless they open all your cabinets in your house, at which point they're robbing you.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.060
And then some mugs are going to go away and you're fine.

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.340
Oh, so you got robbed.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.340
Yeah.

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.300
That'll get you out a lot of roommate pickles.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:50.820
Uh, I mean, you could spend a whole day smashing 30 mugs or you could just smash the one coffee

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:51.820
maker.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.980
Well, I don't need these anymore.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:04.900
Because of an advertiser that pulled out of your favorite conservative news talk show.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.620
Topical when we use this episode in February.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.620
Yeah.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.020
What the fuck are they even talking about?

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.420
What did Mr. Coffee do now?

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:23.340
Um, sometimes I like to store bacon grease in a mug because if you pour it down the drain,

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.940
it'll clog the drain.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:30.420
So maybe you could just start cooking a lot of bacon.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.660
You can also then later use it for like for making gravy.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.340
It's not perfect for making gravy or if you want to take some out and put it, hey, Thanksgiving

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.340
tip.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.660
That's coming up.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.620
Maybe you put a little bacon grease on the skin.

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.620
That's real nice.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.620
You're going to like that a lot.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.140
It's not a joke.

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.860
Not especially funny is the only problem.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:47.860
It's not a joke.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.860
Just let me try this Thanksgiving.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.860
Can you form it?

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.740
He's laughing because they're typing it into Evernote right now.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.740
Like, do not forget.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:05.660
Can you make a mug friend out of all these mugs named Muggsy and you can't take Muggsy

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.660
apart.

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.820
I love Muggsy and it won't be on your shelves anymore.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:16.540
Be in your living room filling up a whole chair and you can play games with Muggsy and

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.500
watch television with your new best friend, Muggsy.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.780
What video game would you play with Muggsy?

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.780
Bubs.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.780
Bubsy.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.780
Oh, shit.

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.780
Cuphead.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.020
That's what I was going for.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.300
God damn it.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.300
Here's the thing.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.300
One of the things you.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.860
Oh, I love Muggsy though.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:39.820
Are you going to play with Muggsy or are you going to do a different joke?

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.700
When my daughter makes slime, she only likes to make it.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.700
She doesn't like to play with it.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:48.300
So I'll take it and I'll put it in what I like to think of as slime purgatory.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.180
So it's hidden on a shelf and if she notices in three days, then she gets it back.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.100
If she doesn't notice, it's straight in the trash.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.860
So try that with mugs.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:00.780
So you just take one mug and hide it and if she doesn't notice that one, then you throw

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.340
it in the trash and you just keep repeating that.

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.380
And eventually she's like, I could have fucking sworn I own 30 mugs.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.340
Why don't I own six?

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340
Unless.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.340
Unless.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.700
Unless she likes to put them all on the floor, jump into them like a Scrooge McDuck.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.700
Are you okay?

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:25.340
I think, I think when my vertebra, the one that carries coherent thoughts from my brain

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.620
to the rest of my body has dissolved.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.620
Did we help?

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620
I'm sorry, what?

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.620
No, we didn't.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.620
Sit down.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.980
Thank you.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980
Thank you very much.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.980
Thank you very much.

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.980
And thank you to you.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980
Really think about Muggsy though.

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980
Really think about Muggsy.

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:44.980
There's a lot of meat on them bugs.

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.140
Thank you to the Orpheum for having us.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.140
We're going to wrap up here.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140
You can bring the lights down.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:54.220
Justin doesn't just start thanking people in the middle of, he's a very grateful dude.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.220
Yeah.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.220
You can bring the house lights down.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.220
Thank you so much.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.220
And bring ours like way back up.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.860
So it can just be the shining glittering stars.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.900
Thank you to you all so much for coming and this has been so fun and Minneapolis, you

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:10.780
are like the literal best and we love you so much.

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.780
Thank you.

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.060
You've been so kind to us and this has been super duper fun.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:22.820

about it and then we come back to it next week and answer, provide our answers to it.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.060
So Griffin, do you have one more Yahoo?

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.060
I do.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.060
Okay.

The secret hacker organization asks in one collective booming voice, a psychic told me

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.860
I had a connection to cats and a cat planet.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.780

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.940
My name is Justin McElroy.
