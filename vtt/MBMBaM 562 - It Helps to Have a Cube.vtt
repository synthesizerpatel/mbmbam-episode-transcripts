WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.220 --> 00:50.220
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.740 --> 01:16.700
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:16.700 --> 01:22.900
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Well, I'm your middle this brother Travis a big dog

01:22.900 --> 01:26.380
Oh woof woof, McElroy and I have my

01:28.060 --> 01:30.060
Baby brother

01:32.780 --> 01:37.040
Tape out. Oh no. Oh, it's stuck. Oh, it's stuck in the

01:39.380 --> 01:41.700
Let me shove a pencil and Griffin twist it

01:41.700 --> 01:43.700
Oh

01:44.740 --> 01:50.180
That was the sound I make when you shove a pencil in me, hey everybody sharpened my pencil which was weird

01:52.940 --> 01:57.660
So happy summer everybody. Yeah. Oh, I should say by the way before we get started

01:57.660 --> 02:01.580
I thank you to everybody who supported us the max fund drive. I know I've said it but

02:02.340 --> 02:04.340
I cure my bone fleas

02:04.420 --> 02:08.580
They're all gone. So everyone can stop asking me about it on

02:08.580 --> 02:10.780
Twitch, but yeah, yeah

02:11.420 --> 02:13.220
Would you say you get?

02:13.220 --> 02:17.420
Maybe a lot of questions about the pill the sharp pill for your butt or

02:18.220 --> 02:22.540
Yeah, I'm more than average whatever the average number is more than that

02:22.660 --> 02:24.900
So we've been doing this show for a while

02:24.900 --> 02:26.540
We've known each other for a while and you know what?

02:26.540 --> 02:29.820
I realize guys you can always get to know each other a little bit more and so on

02:29.820 --> 02:35.420
I was just thinking maybe we could play like a little like I you know, like would you yeah like icebreaker games

02:35.420 --> 02:40.540
Yeah, icebreaker games. This would be more like mantle breaker the mantle of the earth

02:40.540 --> 02:46.140
We've already had fairly well past the ice and now we're burrowing into the into the center

02:46.300 --> 02:48.860
But I was thinking maybe something like, you know

02:48.860 --> 02:54.880
What's a food that you think you could eat the most of in one sitting before you got sick of it more than any other?

02:54.900 --> 02:56.540
human being on earth

02:56.540 --> 02:57.460
No, no, no

02:57.460 --> 03:02.940
Just like what's a food that you Griffin McRae Justin McRae could start eating in one sitting and you think you can

03:02.940 --> 03:06.320
consecutively eat it the longest before you're like

03:06.900 --> 03:13.300
Another bite could like in a you mean in like a sort of Joe Joseph chestnut style sort of but I don't like you're trying to

03:13.300 --> 03:18.420
Hurt yourself, but just like it's the food that for the longest amount of time. He could be like, I'll have one more

03:18.420 --> 03:22.220
Yeah, right back against the idea that Joey chestnut

03:23.100 --> 03:28.420
Could eat a bunch of hot dogs now like not on hot dog day. Do you know what I mean?

03:28.420 --> 03:35.460
There's no way he got into it originally. I'm not like that's very good a good point Griffin because he may have had a big

03:35.460 --> 03:37.460
breakfast

03:38.200 --> 03:40.200
50,000 hamburgers

03:41.700 --> 03:43.800
To prepare and a lot of people think Joe

03:44.300 --> 03:50.700
Joseph a lot of people think Joseph chestnut the way he does is he trains really really hard to eat hot dogs all day every

03:50.700 --> 03:54.660
Day all year round but his secret is that he just doesn't eat hot dogs all year

03:54.660 --> 03:58.900
So that when hot dog eating day comes around he's so fucking excited for it

03:59.740 --> 04:03.460
Do you think that people have ever been out to lunch with Joseph chestnut?

04:03.640 --> 04:06.380
They're like so you wanna get hot dogs?

04:06.380 --> 04:10.140
He's like, yeah, sure and then he goes to the hot dog counter and he's like, um

04:10.140 --> 04:13.740
I think I'll have two hot dogs and the everyone is like

04:14.580 --> 04:19.340
Do you mean 200 do you eat 200 like no just I think just two for me today

04:19.340 --> 04:25.560
I think I'll just enjoy two hot dogs. Hey, mr. Chestnut. It's me hot dog Joe owner of hot dog Joe's

04:25.560 --> 04:27.740
What's wrong with my hot dogs? No, it's nothing

04:27.740 --> 04:32.340
I know I would love to eat a hundred of them dipped in water, but right now I just want two of them

04:32.340 --> 04:34.340
Well, I'm sorry. I

04:34.860 --> 04:37.060
Yeah, I can bring you a hundred hot dog

04:37.060 --> 04:39.420
You don't think I can make a hundred eyes, too

04:39.420 --> 04:45.820
If that's the problem, I just really only want to two hot dogs today. I know it's okay

04:45.820 --> 04:49.780
So is there you want to answer to your question? Yeah, I want an answer. What's the food that you think?

04:49.780 --> 04:56.740
You could eat the most of before you became sick of it in one sitting. I make a I make it caramel

04:58.060 --> 05:03.420
cereal snack mix that has like nuts in it and it's got spice and

05:05.100 --> 05:11.720
Like a hardened crunchy caramel exterior and all the pieces and a lot of a good amount of salt, too

05:11.720 --> 05:19.920
Oh, it's a very well balanced kind of thing. And I feel like I feel like that's the kind of thing where I

05:21.200 --> 05:26.140
Just I just keep eating. I mean like I have scientific evidence to prove. This is like it's called Saturday

05:26.360 --> 05:28.360
I could just keep eating him

05:28.640 --> 05:34.800
And I don't think I don't I think I could get a really good clip going and you're not worried about like too much crunch

05:34.800 --> 05:39.700
Hurt in the old jaw. Are you talking about a desire to continue to consume?

05:39.700 --> 05:42.480
Are you can talking about physical endurance?

05:43.120 --> 05:48.560
Require an awareness of the impact of these on my human frame. Well, I don't that's a different question

05:48.560 --> 05:53.440
I don't think that I have a hard time separating the two because Mike a lot of bad food choices traffic

05:53.440 --> 05:59.800
No, no, it's the worst one time. He ate beans only beans for five years. No, I remember that. I remember that

06:00.440 --> 06:02.440
The Wind Waker. Yeah

06:02.440 --> 06:04.880
The Wind Waker was very good. Thank you

06:04.880 --> 06:09.840
I joke see cuz I my first knee-jerk was peanut M&Ms, you know

06:09.840 --> 06:13.080
But after a while started to get locked on there, you know

06:13.960 --> 06:17.320
Yeah, I think veggie straws would be my answer those

06:17.720 --> 06:22.920
They're they got enough flavor and salty to be delicious, but not so much

06:23.560 --> 06:30.340
That I think you're talking volume now, bud. Hey, but you're talking volume talking. That's your mass. Yeah

06:30.880 --> 06:32.480
Yeah

06:32.480 --> 06:36.360
What's yours Griffin? I don't know

06:37.040 --> 06:42.040
No, boy fucking at this point. It's got to have a lot of protein in it

06:42.600 --> 06:49.280
Mm-hmm to keep me going to keep me going and keep me strong. That's it. I guess it needs to be a food that is

06:50.000 --> 06:57.520
Not gonna fill me up so much but also has lots of protein to sustain the eating motion of it and but also vitamins

06:57.520 --> 06:59.360
I guess and

06:59.360 --> 07:03.160
So I would say I have to say ants on a log. Oh

07:04.080 --> 07:05.840
Yeah, man

07:05.840 --> 07:07.000
celery

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
peanut butter

07:09.040 --> 07:10.760
raisins

07:10.760 --> 07:17.040
Just yours is sort of straight over the plate. No fuss. No muss ants on a log. No tricks here

07:17.420 --> 07:23.440
Yeah, no zhuzhen it up. No zhuzhen it up. Don't fucking sprinkle paprika on it or anything like that

07:23.440 --> 07:29.360
I want a very basic vanilla ants on a log without no almond butter. No butter

07:30.440 --> 07:37.320
No, no golden raisins. You don't want a star. This is uh, this was good stuff trap. This is a good idea

07:37.320 --> 07:40.440
Yeah, where did you think the comedy would come? I didn't think it would come

07:40.440 --> 07:44.680
I just wanted us to get to know each other better. Sometimes it's just heartwarming and nice. You know what I mean? Huh?

07:44.720 --> 07:46.800
Yeah, sometimes yeah. Yeah

07:47.840 --> 07:49.560
Huh?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.560
Normally we don't plan on

07:51.560 --> 07:54.400
Sort of an anti comedy comedy. Yeah

07:55.200 --> 07:57.200
Comedy I wasn't trying to make it sad

07:57.320 --> 08:01.000
I just thought we could get to know each other sure sure sure

08:01.120 --> 08:03.680
Let's maybe balance it out and do a nice

08:03.880 --> 08:10.400
comedy bookend by talking about what we do think Joey Chestnut's bathroom looks like because it's a funny it's where you always go when you

08:10.400 --> 08:15.640
Talk about how many hot dogs the man eats but like for real there everybody focuses on the goddamn hot dogs

08:15.640 --> 08:19.440
It's the bun that's gonna give him bathroom. Okay, I was speaking holistically

08:19.440 --> 08:25.800
Duh, I was speaking holistically about the whole I'm not talking about eating just the wieners trap

08:25.800 --> 08:28.420
You can't do that though Griffin. You have a kid

08:28.520 --> 08:33.080
You know that you cannot talk about hot dogs as a combination food

08:33.240 --> 08:38.120
Right because nine times out of ten my kid doesn't want the bun. Okay, just want the hot dog

08:38.120 --> 08:41.640
Well, my kid likes the bun so I you're you're really projecting a lot

08:41.640 --> 08:46.920
But what do you did he's gotta have what like a I advise him big IMAX screen

08:46.920 --> 08:51.040
In there to fill the time to just fucking kick it. I

08:51.800 --> 08:57.200
Have my Xbox in my back in the bathroom and that would be my own personal Xbox

08:57.200 --> 09:02.480
I have a controller that I bring in there and I bring out of there that nobody else should be allowed to

09:03.080 --> 09:06.740
Interface with I think he probably also has one of those like, you know

09:06.740 --> 09:12.400
The the chairs that you see in like first class in the airplane. Yeah where they can like recline into a full bed

09:12.400 --> 09:19.860
Oh cool. Yeah, it's probably something like that, right and it also has like a console and like here's the headphones that hang here

09:19.860 --> 09:21.860
And there's a button to call for help

09:24.620 --> 09:30.000
Definitely he just walks away. He's got Joey chestnuts got life alert for

09:30.560 --> 09:36.120
Sure, he needs that button in any bathroom. He ever goes in cuz he doesn't know when it's gonna happen. I

09:36.120 --> 09:44.240
Mean, it's in the shower his toilets in the shower, right? This doesn't get any sense any other way

09:44.560 --> 09:50.720
Do you think that he hibernate? It's got me the shower cuz otherwise he finishes up and was he have five blue foots

09:51.960 --> 09:55.840
It's gotta be in the shower could be a car wash situation

09:55.840 --> 10:01.920
That's right room goes into that's toilet shower

10:02.520 --> 10:07.400
Refrigerator all in one sort of cube that he just yeah, July 4th

10:09.080 --> 10:14.080
July 5th enters the cube, July 28 leaves the cube

10:14.280 --> 10:21.120
Yeah, Joe just gets slapped by a bunch of wet soapy nylon straps for two straight weeks, Joey

10:21.120 --> 10:24.040
I like your beard. Thanks. I grew it in the cube

10:24.040 --> 10:27.760
Were you asleep in the cube or were you yes?

10:27.760 --> 10:28.240
Yes

10:28.240 --> 10:34.200
It is friends have to explain like somebody comes to the door to get a sign for a package and they're like I got a package

10:34.200 --> 10:37.600
Here for Joseph chestnut and his daughter has to be like currently

10:37.600 --> 10:43.880
My father is filth and my father will be filth for several days until the cube is that it's grim work. I

10:44.680 --> 10:51.680
Don't I I thought sir. I find it better to think that I don't have a father now because he's in a quantum state

10:51.680 --> 10:56.960
But the existing and being filth a sort of LCL primordial soup in there

10:59.400 --> 11:03.160
You know how no one's quite sure how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly

11:04.280 --> 11:10.040
Here's one thing I could be sure sir the package the Joseph chestnut that that package was sent to will not be the Joseph

11:10.440 --> 11:16.520
Emerges from the cube. He is a different father. He's sloughing off his inside and outsides. So

11:16.520 --> 11:22.300
It's in a way honestly, it's in the manner and style of

11:23.720 --> 11:28.360
Dr. Who I do love how every time when Joseph chestnut exits the cube

11:28.360 --> 11:33.160
He gets to have a fun like what is this Joseph chestnut dress in you know kind of montage

11:33.160 --> 11:40.440
He goes through his large closet and picks out a whimsical scarf. Oh, man. All right, so it's a vice show. Yeah, it's a vice

11:41.340 --> 11:45.480
My boss has been stressed lately and the lighten the tension during lulls and meetings

11:45.480 --> 11:49.400
I started asking silly icebreaker questions. Oh, what a great idea. Yeah, I

11:50.960 --> 11:54.920
Go with anxiety by using humor so I didn't consider the consequences

11:55.480 --> 12:00.480
Along the way, my boss has dubbed me the funny person, which is not something I'm known for anywhere else

12:00.800 --> 12:05.160
As a result during meeting low points, she'll say got anything for us. Oh

12:06.640 --> 12:08.640
Oh my god

12:08.640 --> 12:16.440
Brothers how do I quickly shed this? Tell a joke persona that's been assigned to me without having to directly address the issue

12:16.440 --> 12:20.100
That's from persona problems in the Pacific Northwest now

12:20.100 --> 12:26.120
We have I know dealt with similar issues where people become like people love to label don't they?

12:27.520 --> 12:32.600
Put people in the little boxes full of ticky-tack. We love to organize everything

12:32.600 --> 12:38.560
Sure, organize everything in this person the thing they it's like for me. I run into this all the time

12:38.560 --> 12:42.400
Where people in my neighborhood think me as the funny person? Yeah, sexy person, right?

12:42.400 --> 12:47.280
You know what I mean? I mean, you know sexual powerful man and having me

12:47.280 --> 12:53.240
You know, I I told one icebreaker at the beginning of this episode and people are already labeling me the funny one

12:53.240 --> 12:57.520
You know, it's funny actually Travis everything. Yes, except the bad one. Oh

12:57.520 --> 13:02.260
All right, that's all yeah funny in quotes

13:03.080 --> 13:06.760
Funny about Travis you got a shit. You got a you got a

13:07.240 --> 13:14.540
Okay, you gotta make someone else the funny person. You're not gonna change this habit of labeling, but you can start to set up

13:15.680 --> 13:20.840
You know Tabitha when she's like when like Tabitha with a good punchline

13:20.840 --> 13:27.720
Or even if it's not a good punchline Tabitha says anything you laugh your head off. Oh, you got it

13:27.720 --> 13:32.120
That's got me cracking over here. She's talking about her. No, it's hearing this. I'm busting up

13:32.480 --> 13:35.660
She's talking about it. I was watching mass singer last night

13:36.680 --> 13:38.160
Yeah

13:38.160 --> 13:44.480
It's a big lie cuz they won't say who it is and then it's Kermit for some reason

13:44.480 --> 13:51.760
Let me offer a different possibility. Okay, because this it seems like you are doing very little

13:53.040 --> 14:00.040
Asking a silly icebreaker and being labeled the funny one seems like the threshold for funny is very low in this office

14:00.480 --> 14:04.680
okay, this feels like you could buy perhaps a children's joke book and

14:05.480 --> 14:09.820
Let it do the heavy lifting for you and still continue to be the funny one

14:09.820 --> 14:15.240
Which all things considered is better than being like the industrious one

14:15.620 --> 14:19.780
One who always undertakes projects and finishes them on time, right?

14:20.660 --> 14:24.220
You could also find a brand that is so

14:25.020 --> 14:26.220
sort of

14:26.220 --> 14:28.220
comprehensive that it overwrites

14:28.580 --> 14:33.220
The funny one like if you start if you like dye your hair

14:34.420 --> 14:38.100
like either jet black or jet white and then you

14:38.100 --> 14:44.740
Start you wear like the clothes of like a haunted like circus ringleader and you're like, yeah, I'm them

14:44.740 --> 14:47.660
I'm them. Oh, that's that's Tabitha

14:48.260 --> 14:50.260
She's the my chemical romance

14:51.300 --> 14:52.660
person and

14:52.660 --> 14:59.220
Yeah, or you could do half black and half white and be the big Cruella fan. Yeah. Oh, that's Tabitha

14:59.220 --> 15:05.820
She saw Cruella and it changed to change your shit. You can lean into Disney shit enough to where you become the Disney person

15:05.820 --> 15:08.540
Oh, yeah, that's not hard. That's not hard. I've done that

15:08.540 --> 15:11.540
I did it accidentally and I just woke up one day and I wasn't dizzy

15:11.540 --> 15:15.140
It was the Disney boy is what my neighborhood calls me the incredible

15:15.140 --> 15:20.500
They call me the incredible Disney boy the incredible funny sexy Disney boy the incredible hilarious

15:21.020 --> 15:22.180
sexual

15:22.180 --> 15:24.180
So that's all caps. Yeah

15:24.540 --> 15:29.480
Disney boy just does a lot of Disney bounding and then he struts around just flexing them perks

15:30.780 --> 15:32.780
Yeah, it's always Maui

15:32.780 --> 15:34.500
Oh

15:34.500 --> 15:37.460
What Disney cosplay showcases the pecs

15:38.220 --> 15:44.820
Also scar if you do it, right scar. Oh, yeah, and even if you do it wrong, it's still gonna raise a few eyebrows

15:47.260 --> 15:49.260
Also few realizations

15:50.860 --> 15:53.600
Awakening I could get him out as Pumba still

15:54.260 --> 15:55.720
Yeah

15:55.720 --> 16:03.180
Really any liking characters more about the butt though. Really any Lion King character is not gonna be wearing me clothes. Oh

16:03.180 --> 16:09.260
That's true. They're very few. I mean Triton you could do Triton and get the pecs out. Yeah, Triton's all a Gaston

16:10.100 --> 16:16.140
Gaston maybe a beach Gaston. What other shirtless Disney character Tarzan Tarzan Hercules

16:16.140 --> 16:23.140
There's there's a part of Hercules where his onesie is ripped. I misspelled all three words

16:23.140 --> 16:25.900
So excited was I to make this. Oh, yeah

16:26.740 --> 16:30.540
Wow, that oughta completed way too quick on my Google

16:30.820 --> 16:38.580
You guys are gonna get some weird as you guys aren't gonna believe this but a lot of these pictures I'm seeing aren't official

16:39.380 --> 16:46.440
Licensed Disney images from the films really are they like from the novels or yeah

16:46.440 --> 16:53.460
They're from the novelizations of the movies. I guess I don't think this Aladdin's even wearing pants, huh?

16:54.940 --> 17:01.420
What a weird wish that was it you're uh, you're bullying that wasn't in your search query in the heuristics

17:02.420 --> 17:07.740
How strange wait is your safe search off Griffin? You got turn it on you gotta turn it on

17:08.340 --> 17:09.580
I

17:09.580 --> 17:13.300
Rachel doesn't let me turn safe search off. That's for the best

17:13.300 --> 17:20.460
It's definitely you could be ruined by five minutes on Google Lee shang from Mulan for sure. Oh, yeah, that's a go

17:20.460 --> 17:26.680
And that's a good one. Let's get down to business. Don't mind if I do these buns. Oh, we did it. Damn it. Damn it

17:27.220 --> 17:34.300
Wow. Hey, I've got a question from the internet a little wisdom from the crowd and it's coming from a wisdom of the crowd

17:34.300 --> 17:37.060
It's a good name for this. I got some wisdom of the crowd and

17:37.660 --> 17:39.660
it's coming from a news source that

17:39.660 --> 17:47.380
Seems like it could be I don't know. I'm excited about it because I didn't realize that there were questions on

17:48.220 --> 17:50.220
WikiHow and Emily

17:52.260 --> 17:56.420
What trap I also pulled the WikiHow article Oh for this episode

17:56.860 --> 18:00.180
Yeah, how wild is it how to hide from a murderer?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.780
No, okay. Well that

18:02.860 --> 18:06.420
That's the one I've chosen. Don't you have so many bits, please?

18:06.420 --> 18:12.500
Please leave me these the crumbs and scraps of how to hide from a murderer on wikiHow

18:12.500 --> 18:19.180
Thank you, Emily and wikiHow, if you remember on it's got a little charming little doodles and illustrations of how to do things that you

18:19.180 --> 18:25.460
Probably shouldn't need a guide on how to do it. I don't know. There's some helpful stuff and how to hide from a murderer

18:26.340 --> 18:33.660
Like hiding effectively. You got to use your barricades. Stay quiet. Turn your phone on silent people. This is not get murdered 101

18:34.380 --> 18:35.580
101

18:35.580 --> 18:38.380
That's like the opposite from what I learned from home alone

18:39.140 --> 18:41.340
Hmm. Yeah, I guess he made himself known

18:42.020 --> 18:48.540
He announced his presence. That's sort of the he gets for like the scream at the bear, right?

18:48.740 --> 18:50.540
style of

18:50.540 --> 18:53.580
Threat avoidance, right punch the shark in the nose

18:54.220 --> 18:59.220
unless you think of Kevin McCallister as the killer at which point and you do part of and and

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
Marv or whatever their names were

19:01.500 --> 19:08.740
So they say to choose a hiding place that can be barricaded and then number three is obscure your location and then number four is

19:08.740 --> 19:13.700
Avoid hiding together and the number five is hide in behind or under something. So most of these tips so far are

19:14.300 --> 19:16.180
hide well

19:16.180 --> 19:21.420
And how far down the list is like make the murderer fall in love with you. It's it's coming

19:21.820 --> 19:27.700
There is one that says hide in plain sight is if necessary, which just means pretend to have already been murdered

19:27.700 --> 19:32.620
So if the murder is in your house and sees your body on the floor and they'll be like did I already murdered them?

19:33.220 --> 19:38.100
Shit, I forgot. I got so excited with all the murdering. I lost count of how many murders I've done shit

19:38.100 --> 19:40.780
That really doesn't work if you live alone, though, does it? Yeah

19:41.780 --> 19:48.220
Run away is on their head to safety plan to fight if you must is about halfway down

19:48.780 --> 19:51.580
And that means, you know get an improvised weapon

19:51.580 --> 19:58.860
And take their knife and use the knife on them to make them die instead. Yeah, here's the problem with that being so low down

19:58.860 --> 20:00.860
The list though Griffin. Yeah, I've already

20:01.500 --> 20:07.860
If I've just googled this because I need it in the moment, right and I've barricaded myself into my hiding spot

20:07.860 --> 20:15.140
Mm-hmm, and I don't have the weapon with me. They should have put plan to fight if you need to first right then but

20:15.140 --> 20:21.520
It's a number the part three of this article is planning ahead and it includes things like

20:21.900 --> 20:26.660
Have a safe room and make sure you have important supplies in your safe room

20:26.660 --> 20:31.480
Like according to this image two baseball bats and a shotgun and no food

20:32.020 --> 20:35.900
So that's great. Now. Here's why I wanted to bring the wiki how I

20:36.940 --> 20:43.820
Real briefly. I will say that I appreciate that plan ahead for getting murdered is sort of like normalization of an anxiety disorder

20:43.820 --> 20:48.820
Right, which I do enjoy that. Yeah. No, some of us have been doing that since we were

20:49.220 --> 20:52.340
Planning ahead for everything. Yeah all the time

20:53.540 --> 21:00.340
Now I wanted to bring wiki how because I didn't realize this until Emily sent this in at the bottom of every wiki

21:00.340 --> 21:03.540
how article there is a community Q&A and

21:04.740 --> 21:08.140
There's some good stuff in there. The answers are provided by the community

21:08.140 --> 21:10.780
The questions are asked by the community and let's just go down

21:10.780 --> 21:15.780
I think they are ranked by how helpful they have been found by the community

21:15.780 --> 21:16.860
So we can start at the top

21:16.860 --> 21:19.660
Are we allowed to randomly throw snake steak knives at them?

21:19.660 --> 21:22.620
If you someone's trying to kill you you can defend yourself

21:22.620 --> 21:27.220
But throwing steak knife seems like a good way to arm your attacker, especially if you are not a skilled knife thrower

21:27.220 --> 21:33.140
I can I ran randomly certainly implies that right? I mean randomly throwing steak knives

21:33.180 --> 21:37.540
No, if you're targeting yeah sort of serving the jellies of the bar, right?

21:37.540 --> 21:41.540
Can I calculatedly throw steak knife at the body? Yeah, that's it

21:41.540 --> 21:45.700
And we do get into sort of I believe it differs state to state on whether or not

21:46.420 --> 21:48.420
If you hurt the intruder

21:48.500 --> 21:54.340
Then is it okay and that gets us into some weird territory. One of the questions is straight up

21:54.340 --> 21:57.880
What should I do if I accidentally kill the murderer while fighting which I want to be like

21:58.600 --> 22:00.600
listen to somebody

22:01.220 --> 22:03.820
Put the cart before the murder horse a little bit

22:03.820 --> 22:09.780
If someone breaks into my house to murder me and my mind jumps to oh, I hope I don't murder them

22:13.220 --> 22:19.500
Now I do like the use of the word though in the question of allowed as though you would start throwing steak knives at the

22:19.500 --> 22:23.380
Murderer and the murderer be like hey now. Yeah, that's dirty pool

22:24.060 --> 22:28.940
Now another question is what if the murderer finds you in your hiding spot and they say fight back and aim for the head

22:28.940 --> 22:34.300
Especially the temple neck or eyes with the weapon or the eyes neck and nose with your hands using tightly closed fists

22:34.300 --> 22:37.900
Okay, am I supposed to do that or pretend to already be murdered?

22:38.460 --> 22:43.860
Like what the third the third option is obviously they find you and then you say oh you got me

22:43.860 --> 22:50.940
Okay. Now you hide and I'll seek. Yeah, see cuz 5050 that's gonna work. Yeah, and now my man gets in there

22:50.940 --> 22:56.260
I don't know who asked this but it's me in another dimension asks. What if I need to use the bathroom while hiding?

22:56.260 --> 23:04.500
Absolutely, my two concerns when murder breaks in my house is one and I I hope I don't murder them instead and two

23:05.220 --> 23:06.740
this would be

23:06.740 --> 23:12.660
Pretty choice right about now, and I don't know how long I'm gonna be able you could do am you could do amnesty?

23:12.660 --> 23:17.820
Oh, I'm out timeout timeout amnesty timeout timeout timeout

23:18.700 --> 23:23.420
See, this is why it helps to have a cube because if you have a cube, that's your panic room and your bathroom

23:23.420 --> 23:25.420
Oh

23:29.260 --> 23:34.000
Open up the container and see just the the the orange liquid floating inside

23:35.780 --> 23:38.220
Immediately it's air so some of Joey's

23:38.220 --> 23:47.100
Aerosol talks into humans. It's too soon. My molecular structure, please. You've already I'm here to marry you Jeff. Joey

23:47.100 --> 23:52.300
Just so you've already killed me man. This new M night movie is really weird

23:53.300 --> 24:01.500
Traver you talking about old the new M night movie old old where people go to old beach and become old

24:01.900 --> 24:03.900
in old

24:03.900 --> 24:07.960
Catch old this summer with in night Shyamalan's old

24:09.140 --> 24:15.720
Starring Joey Chester. I had it. I had a great real briefly. I my wife said to me

24:15.720 --> 24:18.140
Did you hear about the new M night movie and I said?

24:19.340 --> 24:25.020
No, and she briefly told me about it and she said it's supposed to be a return to form for M night

24:25.020 --> 24:30.420
I'm like, hmm. Okay. She said although I heard that the Ville the the visit was supposed to be good

24:30.420 --> 24:37.380
So maybe that was his return to form and I said sweetheart we watched the visit we saw this film and she said well

24:37.380 --> 24:39.380
I guess it probably wasn't a form

24:39.940 --> 24:46.260
We did watch the film and not maintain any of the memories of his form is something new now

24:46.460 --> 24:47.980
He has a new form

24:47.980 --> 24:52.820
I just wanted to close this out with one of the last questions is what if I just gave up and let him take me like

24:52.820 --> 24:55.140
If he won fair and square and they answered

24:55.140 --> 24:57.100
I

24:57.100 --> 24:58.260
Respect

24:58.260 --> 25:02.540
That's good sportsmanship. I like that if he was a murderer then he'd most likely kill you

25:02.540 --> 25:04.580
So I don't recommend this to push course of action

25:04.580 --> 25:04.820
Yeah

25:04.820 --> 25:10.860
But at a certain point also like if I don't have my weapons and I'm laying on the floor and the murder says hey

25:11.300 --> 25:15.020
Straight up. I don't think I murdered you yet. Did I and I rolled over like nah

25:15.700 --> 25:17.700
There's nothing I can do now

25:18.500 --> 25:20.500
peace

25:20.500 --> 25:24.540
Ah take me you win you did it congratulations

25:25.500 --> 25:30.340
I was worried. I was gonna murder you there for a second, but it looks like that was an unfounded

25:31.180 --> 25:38.300
First could I please do it so that my family members don't find me in a big sticky mess. Ah, let's take a break

25:38.300 --> 25:50.580
Okay. Yeah for sure. We've been working hard

25:50.580 --> 25:55.420
Hey, do you guys ever get home from the store and you're like no

25:55.780 --> 25:56.300
Okay

25:56.300 --> 26:02.500
I went to the store to get batteries and you come home and you've got a watermelon and you got some shredded cheese

26:02.740 --> 26:05.740
Then you got a mylar balloon. Yeah, what did you forget?

26:06.460 --> 26:07.540
batteries

26:07.540 --> 26:13.860
You know, yeah. Yeah. Oh, what are you gonna do? Go back out to the store? No, you're gonna get on door-dash

26:14.340 --> 26:20.740
That's right door-dash. It connects you to restaurants and what's that stores? Yeah groceries and stuff

I stitch fix since you close in a box and that's ideal because shopping for clothes is a terrible process that nobody

27:06.980 --> 27:13.000
Actually enjoys and the people who say they do are lying to you to be sounding like impressive

27:13.100 --> 27:16.640

Speaking of no sweat the latest box I got from stitch fix was filled

27:43.380 --> 27:50.260
Exclusively with moisture wicking fabric clothing and I saw this and I said stitch fix. I don't know about this one my body

27:50.260 --> 27:52.260
I don't really push it to

27:54.700 --> 27:57.180
I don't really push it to the point where it creates

27:57.180 --> 27:58.300
generalized

27:58.300 --> 28:00.420
Sort of body moisture

28:00.420 --> 28:07.100
But you know what barely has enough of what he needs in his body at any given time without excreting he needs to reabsorb that

28:07.980 --> 28:09.020

28:09.020 --> 28:11.100
I put some of these bad boys on

28:11.260 --> 28:15.340

28:15.340 --> 28:22.340

31:21.740 --> 31:27.100
from Scott the veep of product innovation and development for Sonic

Can I please be done with my quote? Please? I can't let me go. I want to go home and see my kids

32:16.080 --> 32:23.440
That's the end of Scott's quote. That is a that's good. That sounds not right. It looks like a good sandwich

32:23.440 --> 32:27.360
It's on a hinge slice roll, but you know, you know how we do it here on the squad

32:27.360 --> 32:31.120
We're not just gonna give you a new entry in the chicken sandwich wars because that's honestly

32:32.160 --> 32:38.200
It's a little set broasters in on it. By the way, broaster the popular manufacturer of gas station chicken

32:38.200 --> 32:45.540
Chicken cooking equipment is like we got a chicken sandwich machine for you. I'm not gonna reach that story Chuck e cheese. Oh

33:35.840 --> 33:40.000
The iconic group will be hitting the road for their first ever

33:41.120 --> 33:47.280
Concert tour is munches make-believe band. Chuck e cheese is rock-afire explosion. I

33:48.080 --> 33:52.080
Honestly, I'm we grew up in like

33:52.080 --> 33:59.480
We grew up in like, you know, we grew up in a Billy Bob house right now like so I don't actually know

33:59.680 --> 34:02.920
We've only ever had hydrox. I've never had Oreo before

34:03.480 --> 34:05.120
That kind of thing

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
It's that kind of thing

34:09.240 --> 34:12.560
I'm trying to figure out how to listen to this this

34:12.720 --> 34:18.000
I'm just saying if y'all have never seen Billy you put Billy Bob up against the Chuck e cheese any day of the week

34:18.000 --> 34:24.040
Billy Bob, he seems approachable. Yeah, seems like a kind of bear. You could have a beer with he's a big friendly bear

34:24.760 --> 34:30.920
With a with a bird in a can and he plays but then cheese scares the shit out of me

34:30.920 --> 34:33.120
Oh the teams are afraid of five nights at Freddy's

34:33.120 --> 34:38.160
But I could just can't do it cuz I'm I grew up in the shadow of this big friendly hillbilly bear and I love him

34:38.160 --> 34:44.720
So much hurt me. I trust that boy with my life now. I don't trust that wolf over there stage left

34:44.720 --> 34:47.240
No, right the wolf with a puppet. Yeah, not even

34:47.600 --> 34:52.440
Yeah, the wolf with a puppet the wolf who is a puppet himself who also has a puppet part

34:53.160 --> 34:54.960
No, thanks

34:54.960 --> 35:00.000
Good news everybody. Don't worry. I did manage to secure some tracks

35:00.000 --> 35:17.360
From the new Chuck e cheese joint, so let's just let's just I'm just gonna let her rip. Hold on

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
It's such a perfect day

35:32.000 --> 35:44.060
I can't wait to feel this

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Oh

36:15.880 --> 36:20.620
Okay, so you get the well right off the bat can I acknowledge two things yeah it slaps

36:21.960 --> 36:27.880
Trips and bops and fucking hits and it hits so hard. It kind of feels like this song is about the end of kovat

36:27.880 --> 36:35.400
Oh, it doesn't kind of feel like that trap. It is that a hundred percent Chuck Charles entertainment cheeses tacit

36:36.520 --> 36:40.880
Acknowledgement of the existence of kovat and how glad he is that it is passed by the way

36:41.440 --> 36:49.040
Fucking Charles if I can speak to you over here for a minute. I saw your ads in fucking like May of

36:49.720 --> 36:55.920
2020 where you're showing people cleaning tables and you're like we keep it clean. So mom will be happy to

36:55.920 --> 36:57.400
Open for business

36:57.400 --> 37:00.360
You've been partying non-stop my friend

37:00.960 --> 37:05.520
No question. No questions on this. You've not been separate for anybody

37:05.520 --> 37:07.600
You've been partying all year

37:07.600 --> 37:13.080
But I also want to acknowledge that this song falls into my favorite sub genre of music

37:13.200 --> 37:15.680
Which is songs about other songs

37:16.240 --> 37:23.040
When you have a song that's talking about like their favorite song on the radio or like hey DJ turn that music up or like oh

37:23.040 --> 37:25.040
Hey, it's not the greatest song in the world

37:25.040 --> 37:31.620
Right gosh songs about other songs that are not the song that we're singing is my favorite sub

37:31.680 --> 37:36.520
Genre of music and I can't believe Chuck E. Cheese just added a new track

37:37.440 --> 37:40.360
I feel like after hearing this I

37:40.860 --> 37:48.680
Have an image of how Charles entertainment cheese conducts himself on social media, and I'm not saying that he is like

37:48.680 --> 37:56.600
a full-blown anti-vaxxer, but I definitely think he's the type to just like be like I'm just asking the questions. Oh

37:57.440 --> 38:00.120
Nothing wrong. I'm just asking questions. Oh

38:00.680 --> 38:06.640
I just retweeted it to see what you guys thought you guys were inflamed to

38:07.560 --> 38:08.680
discussion

38:08.680 --> 38:15.560
Yes, can I just real quick? I'm gonna this fucking album. This is like I thought it would be kind of a goof

38:15.560 --> 38:20.440
This song this album is 12 songs long. There's 12 different tracks on here

38:20.440 --> 38:24.580
I'm gonna read you all the tracks and you guys get to tell me which one you want to hear 30 seconds of

38:24.840 --> 38:26.840
song of summer we just we just

38:27.720 --> 38:33.520
Heard it was extremely good beach party bash dog days this summer. Let's be friends

38:33.520 --> 38:39.600
Oh, I dare you not to laugh that sounds like kind of uh, you know, how like a lot of rap albums

38:39.600 --> 38:44.720
I'm like improv tracks. Oh, yes sounds like kind like that. You know, I mean, I dare you not to laugh stay positive

38:44.720 --> 38:47.600
Which I'm assuming is a cover of the whole steady song

38:48.440 --> 38:50.000
lend a helping hand

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Elray guitarista

38:52.120 --> 38:53.960
game on

38:53.960 --> 38:58.560
Crochet all day crochet all day disco dancing dinosaur party

38:58.560 --> 39:03.860
Fuck and then the last song is called Chucky cheese is all about fun by Chucky cheese. Damn it Justin

39:03.860 --> 39:06.120
We can only pick one. I know

39:06.720 --> 39:11.960
Fuck, I will dip in on some of these we'll let you check out pick what you each get to pick one

39:11.960 --> 39:16.960
I'll eat you Justin. I would like to hear crochet all day. I think that that's what every crochet all day is bonkers

39:25.720 --> 39:33.200
Recently, I've been spending a little more time at home like a lot of people these days hanging out on my own

39:34.640 --> 39:37.800
Time with fun things is really not that tough

39:37.800 --> 39:44.660
But finding that one new passion is proving to be rough. I've done puzzles right juggling

39:45.320 --> 39:48.760
Coloring magic to stuff video chat is fun

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
Especially when it's with you

39:51.880 --> 39:55.260
Gaming binge watching I even try croquet

39:55.260 --> 40:15.260
But nothing has been quite as fun as my new hobby called crochet that is bracing

40:15.260 --> 40:19.700
That is okay. The song's not great, but that that's surprise sort of

40:19.700 --> 40:26.660
Key shift out there. Yeah, I did not sound like a little Sally Hall track. Okay, great. Yeah

40:26.660 --> 40:33.460
Oh god, what was the one about making you laugh? I dare you not to laugh. I mean, this is a comedy program

40:34.460 --> 40:39.300
Want to play a game? Do you even have to ask? Of course, I want to play a game

40:39.580 --> 40:41.460
Okay, this game is called

40:41.460 --> 40:47.420
I dare you not to laugh and the point of the game is to try to think of funny things to make the other person

40:47.420 --> 40:50.140
Laugh and hi, it's me. Justin. I

40:50.700 --> 40:52.060
Don't know

40:52.060 --> 40:54.060
What Charles is about?

40:54.900 --> 40:58.820
It has been by his admission a long fucking yeah. Yep

40:59.300 --> 41:04.740
So and he may not if you're able to keep a straight face without laughing then you win. Oh

41:05.140 --> 41:11.860
This sounds fun. All right, I'll go first. Let's see if you can withstand the silliness. I

41:11.860 --> 41:19.420
I dare you not to laugh. I challenge you not to giggle. Do you think you can be serious?

41:19.420 --> 41:23.780
No smiling not even a little I dare you not to chuckle. Oh

41:25.660 --> 41:29.060
Look at this funny giraffe. I dare you not to laugh

41:32.420 --> 41:36.900
Start when it's the funny shit start Charles. Oh you didn't hear that Griffin

41:37.620 --> 41:39.620
He said that was a picture of a funny giraffe

41:39.620 --> 41:41.620
Funny giraffe

41:41.620 --> 41:42.660
Oh, yeah

41:42.660 --> 41:49.900
How about a platypus wearing a tutu this pickle high-fiving a horse an elephant riding a surfboard

41:49.900 --> 41:55.580
This bumblebee eating s'mores a kitty cat getting a haircut this pig taking a bath

41:55.580 --> 42:01.860
A monkey doing a cartwheel. I dare you not to laugh. Okay, so it seems okay. Yeah

42:03.260 --> 42:05.260
seems

42:05.620 --> 42:08.180
Cats sometimes need to be groomed so

42:08.180 --> 42:09.420
that

42:09.420 --> 42:12.700
One was that one was out. It's that one was out of sight

42:12.700 --> 42:17.020
I I a platypus pointed to two is fucking universally like very funny and I won't

42:17.860 --> 42:22.340
Pickle high-fiving a horse frankly that one I was not expecting that it also didn't fit the mold

42:22.500 --> 42:27.940
Everything else was an animal doing something and this was something doing something to an animal. Yeah

42:29.700 --> 42:35.900
Yeah, it kind of feels like it feels like Charles's entire definition of comedy is

42:35.900 --> 42:40.500
Okay, something doing something to an animal yes

42:40.500 --> 42:56.860
Hey, sorry Charles, are you very busy or are you crochet? Well, I could be busy

43:10.500 --> 43:12.500
I

43:22.420 --> 43:27.340
Hey Helen, what are you having fun?

43:32.500 --> 43:34.500
You get to live another day

43:34.980 --> 43:36.620
This is like

43:36.620 --> 43:39.100
Sorry, I try to say you you get to live another day

43:39.100 --> 43:45.420
Yeah, I just I I hate to just really monopolize the show like this

43:45.420 --> 43:48.660
But I do want to know what dinosaur disco dance party is

43:51.660 --> 43:55.180
All about fun sure I love this

43:55.180 --> 44:03.740
That's what it says

44:25.180 --> 44:29.900
Adapted with the time and game distinction she wrote a novel

44:36.300 --> 44:38.300
Okay

44:40.020 --> 44:42.740
So, okay this rules she escaped the sink

44:42.740 --> 44:48.500
Yeah, she's a state extinction and wrote a novel I achieved distinction. All right, that's a highlight

44:48.500 --> 44:51.060
I like that one quite a bit. That was that was a good track

44:51.060 --> 44:55.860
It kind of feels like they build a whole album around one single. Yeah. Yeah

44:56.660 --> 44:58.660
So he's gonna be

44:58.780 --> 45:00.220
Hitting the road

45:00.220 --> 45:03.020
They coming to to return to our actual story

45:03.740 --> 45:10.220
It is a celebration at all US Chuck E. Cheese locations that begins May 31st. That's today as the crow flies

45:11.020 --> 45:15.700
The new summer fun path. I'm not gonna read their promotion. It doesn't matter quote

45:15.700 --> 45:22.260
We know our guests have missed seeing Chuck E in our stores. That's the other thing that's worth noting is like

45:22.260 --> 45:26.300
They got rid of all Chuck E. Cheese in all stores because they're like kids

45:28.300 --> 45:30.420
But maybe he'll come to his tour

45:31.220 --> 45:37.100
He's been hard at work writing music and recording a new album that sure to delight fans of all ages

45:37.700 --> 45:39.060
Said someone there

45:39.060 --> 45:45.980
we're thrilled that Chuck E and the band are hitting the road to rock fans with our iconic fun tracks and

45:46.540 --> 45:53.800

46:42.420 --> 46:47.220
Yeah, you'll get there for Chuck. So yeah, he is officially

46:47.940 --> 46:55.300
Chuck E. Cheese is going on tour long before we are he is getting out there and playing those outdoor venues and

46:55.660 --> 46:57.660
having the time of his life, so

46:57.660 --> 47:00.020
I'm really excited about that. It's good stuff

47:00.600 --> 47:03.540
Get out there and see Chuck. I'm sure he'd love to see you

47:03.540 --> 47:09.980
He's been as he is apparently just telling everybody really cooped up really cooped up ready to fuck

47:09.980 --> 47:15.980
I'm trying a lot of new things. It sounds like yeah, he's trying a lot of new things. Yeah, pretty much

47:15.980 --> 47:17.980
He said he's open to anything. Yeah

47:18.500 --> 47:20.900
He has another song didn't make the album called

47:22.460 --> 47:25.300
Called that. Dr. Fauci wouldn't let me have my fun break

47:25.300 --> 47:32.580
They had to cut that one for very obvious reasons there's another one called dr. Fauci enemy of fun

47:35.340 --> 47:38.380
Dr. Fauci hates pizza is another one. That's on the album

47:39.980 --> 47:43.740
Dr. Fauci won't admit he's my dad. Yeah, despite having a lot of paperwork

47:44.500 --> 47:48.300
This is stone. Yeah, you want to do one more question? Maybe I want to help

47:48.300 --> 47:55.500
You always see in movies and stuff that putting a ring of salt in the ground is supposed to protect you from ghosts

47:55.660 --> 47:57.900
But how high up off the ground?

47:57.980 --> 48:04.420
Can you get before the protection is no longer effective if I put a big ring of salt down and then fly been a helicopter?

48:04.660 --> 48:09.780
Are the ghosts gonna get me or does the salt produce a sort of anti ghost cylinder?

48:09.900 --> 48:14.620
That extends all the way up to the stratosphere. That's from ruminating about revenants in Richmond

48:14.620 --> 48:20.500
And I mean you're thinking purely terrestrially like once you get out in a space like up and down

48:20.860 --> 48:24.940
Don't mean anything anymore. So like how can you even know that you're still?

48:25.540 --> 48:27.620
In this in the circle so to speak

48:27.780 --> 48:31.100
Well, and I would also say you're only thinking in the up direction

48:31.100 --> 48:34.180
You have to think if you put the ring of salt on this side of the planet

48:34.180 --> 48:38.220
Mm-hmm on the other side of the planet. Yeah, that's stop. Okay, like it's a beam

48:38.220 --> 48:42.780
why is it less able to stop ghosts through sediment right and and

48:42.780 --> 48:46.260
Molten core than it is, you know

48:46.260 --> 48:50.100
Is it now is it maybe just that the ghosts don't like the smell of the salt?

48:50.100 --> 48:55.380
And so it's not even the shape like if you just pour some salt on the ground a ghost comes near it and they're like no

48:55.380 --> 49:02.380
I'm trying to watch my sodium and they leave. I don't think it's the circle because this makes no blood pressure thing

49:02.380 --> 49:07.960
It's a blood pressure thing or I I I think it's so stupid. Okay

49:08.460 --> 49:10.460
It's so fucking stupid

49:10.460 --> 49:14.660
Wow that in in the in literature and stuff

49:14.660 --> 49:21.780
It's like make a ring of salt to protect you from ghosts. Hey, I have things to do. How about this?

49:21.980 --> 49:27.940
How about I make a ring of salt around this ghost and go live my fucking? Oh, that's right

49:28.260 --> 49:34.020
How about he stays there and I put up a sign that's like warning dickhead ghosts say away

49:34.060 --> 49:39.300
Don't fuck with do not mess with salt avoid if rains if rains run

49:39.300 --> 49:44.540
Please trap ghosts again. Have shit to do find salt in cabinet next to the peanut butter

49:44.540 --> 49:49.980
And you know the other no on the other side, that's sugar. Don't you sugar? Don't you sugar?

49:49.980 --> 49:55.620
They'll just laugh and that will bring ants and also hey slugs. Just look out

49:56.260 --> 49:59.980
Slugs look out this signs for you to slug out slugs. They're good for your garden

49:59.980 --> 50:03.820
You don't you don't want to kill don't kill it slugs. Just trap the ghost if it's a ghost

50:04.420 --> 50:06.860
Spare the slugs. Oh, man. What if

50:06.860 --> 50:13.940
What if us you drop some salt and it kills a slug and then the slugs ghost comes out? He's like, well fuck

50:14.780 --> 50:22.180
No, I don't like this at all. Okay. Hey shark tank. I've got a million dollar idea. Okay, okay

50:23.420 --> 50:24.860
salted belts

50:24.860 --> 50:30.300
You can wear them salt always got a ring of salt with you in this and it's just that your belt is soaked in salt

50:30.300 --> 50:31.020
That's good

50:31.020 --> 50:36.140
And if you're eating some flavorless popcorn you take the little guy out and you just a quick swiper across the belt

50:36.140 --> 50:41.500
Not too much though. Not too much because they eventually go so get through. Yeah, you'll wear down your moment Travis

50:41.500 --> 50:46.020
This protects this definitely is gonna protect my thorax from ghosts and my legs and feet. I love that

50:46.620 --> 50:51.540
But what about my appendages? Yeah, salty the bracelets. So bracelets. Oh

50:52.220 --> 50:56.980
Hey, you're starting to play fast and loose with geometry. Okay, fine a salted suit

50:57.620 --> 51:02.740
So the whole suit is circular. Is it a circular? Oh jerky's it?

51:02.740 --> 51:09.260
Oh this that raises an interesting question if a ghost comes into my house and tries to murder me and all of my techniques

51:09.260 --> 51:12.020
That I learned in this episode are proving ineffective

51:12.580 --> 51:14.020
if I

51:14.020 --> 51:19.940
Run into the kitchen can't find the salt, but I do grab about a bag of Chex mix and I do a circle of that

51:20.620 --> 51:26.500
Does the does the latent salt on the Chex mix provide the necessary?

51:27.140 --> 51:31.900
Chemistry to make the ghost go away. Well, here's the good news Griffin

51:31.900 --> 51:35.940
I I think it does but even if it doesn't it's going to start a conversation

51:36.340 --> 51:40.660
It is yeah, and if the ghost is also a vampire

51:40.820 --> 51:46.340
It's gonna slow that vampire down because if you spill a bag of something in front of a vampire they have to count it

51:46.340 --> 51:53.140
Yeah, so they have to stop and count if it's like rice or grain or whatever, which I think Chex mix pretty grainy

51:53.140 --> 51:56.260
Pretty grainy. Yeah, it's gonna work. Sure. So that's gonna stop a

51:56.900 --> 51:59.860
Joey chestnut and a ghost and vampire

51:59.860 --> 52:02.900
and those are my three biggest fears, so

52:03.460 --> 52:06.380
I'm afraid of ghosts come come haunt me make me do things

52:06.380 --> 52:11.180
I don't want to do afraid of vampire come eat me and my family's blood and I'm afraid Joey chestnut come eat all the hot dogs

52:11.180 --> 52:12.860
out of my refrigerator

52:12.860 --> 52:17.240
Mm-hmm, cuz I'm gonna save those for lunch. Yeah, I need those for the big cookout

52:17.820 --> 52:22.300
I'm so glad that we're getting back to our core competencies of talking about ghosts and competitive. Yeah

52:23.340 --> 52:27.440
This really feels like a return to form. How many ghosts do you think you could eat Justin?
