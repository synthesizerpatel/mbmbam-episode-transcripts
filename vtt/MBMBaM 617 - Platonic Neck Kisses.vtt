00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.100 --> 00:50.100

01:40.460 --> 01:42.860
the show we've been talking about and

01:42.860 --> 01:44.180
I

01:44.180 --> 01:46.420
might even say hyping up and

01:47.180 --> 01:52.900
Extolling the virtues of maybe I don't remember doing that Griffin. I don't remember

01:53.900 --> 02:00.080
It being overwhelmingly positive our discussions, but I but but we have gotten lots of messages

02:00.580 --> 02:04.580
from our good friends who have relied on us for

02:05.740 --> 02:07.740
12 years now for

02:08.700 --> 02:10.180
culture

02:10.180 --> 02:12.180
recommendations are

02:12.180 --> 02:18.440
Spiritual guidance spiritual guidance just like last life style tips. It's live

02:18.440 --> 02:22.780
It's live MVB these boys at NB NBA M more letters

02:23.420 --> 02:27.060
wouldn't tell us all about this show if it wasn't gonna be a

02:27.980 --> 02:29.980
knockout and I

02:30.540 --> 02:32.540
Can we stop I?

02:33.340 --> 02:37.740
Don't like it man. You're talking about man versus be right now. Yeah

02:37.740 --> 02:41.420
I'm gonna rely pretty heavily on you two to talk about it because I haven't watched it

02:41.420 --> 02:47.220
You didn't watch it. Nah, it just doesn't seem interesting to me. It are you fuck?

02:47.220 --> 02:51.340
Well, you know, I watched the trailer and like I went I went and I saw it on Netflix

02:51.340 --> 02:57.580
I was like, yeah, it doesn't seem like my thing. How dare you you're kidding, right? No, I haven't watched it. Okay, so we'll just sit here

02:58.620 --> 03:00.620
for 25 minutes while you

03:01.020 --> 03:03.860
35 minutes. Well, I figured you guys could just like walk me through it

03:03.860 --> 03:07.740
I was just busy like spending time with my family and taking care of things around the house

03:07.740 --> 03:12.740
Hey, you're busy as a bee. Oh, yeah, I would say that is that connect? Is there a bee in the show?

03:13.140 --> 03:18.140
Can this can this I just there's a lot of other things on most hostile energy

03:18.140 --> 03:23.060
I feel like you've ever brought to an episode. I hate it. It's really that's saying a lot

03:23.060 --> 03:29.060
It is hate saying a fucking lot trap. Yeah, I know. So why don't you guys kind of walk me through the first episode?

03:29.580 --> 03:33.740
Well, I guess the last is this the last episode we talked about me

03:33.740 --> 03:38.340
Can we can we establish that before we begin so I can prepare myself spiritual

03:38.340 --> 03:42.700
I need to know how much to leave out on the court if this is the last time we ever discuss

03:43.100 --> 03:49.460
This program then I'm I'm you're gonna get beast mode Griffin, which you have not gotten in a long time

03:49.460 --> 03:52.860
I would love that if we have more in the tank more in the future

03:52.860 --> 03:59.540
I will set something aside for that. I will say one problem here and Travis that didn't watch it, which I hate

03:59.540 --> 04:07.060
Uh-huh. I didn't I think he did he's being I didn't I really did I did watch it the first episode

04:07.740 --> 04:10.020
Are you that's that's it. I

04:10.580 --> 04:16.740
Watched one you watched one of this incredibly short television show. How long are the episodes?

04:17.260 --> 04:22.820
You're like 18. There's like it's like seven minutes. There's skits and sketches

04:22.820 --> 04:29.680
First one is like fucking quibbles Justin. You couldn't watch one Quibi. Yeah, Justin. Come on

04:29.900 --> 04:32.300
The problem is I watched them also

04:34.420 --> 04:38.040
Pretty high. Yeah, I will say the one I watched I was pretty high

04:39.340 --> 04:42.980
Did you love it just to evidence that real quick? I'm gonna play the video

04:42.980 --> 04:46.260
I sent you guys so people can kind of hear where my head was at. Sure

04:47.500 --> 04:49.500
part the part with the

04:49.500 --> 04:54.260
The hairdryer that was good. The hairdryer part was good

04:58.980 --> 05:01.740
That's sort of where I was for the

05:02.780 --> 05:05.940
For this episode of television, uh-huh

05:06.460 --> 05:08.460
You'd set thumbs up on this

05:11.380 --> 05:16.820
The hairdryer part Justin's referencing is he knocked the head off a statue chasing B

05:16.820 --> 05:23.660
B and knock a head off a statue and tries to glue it on actually make a point. That wasn't B

05:24.180 --> 05:26.180
That was man. The statue

05:27.940 --> 05:33.580
Statue was he was on the phone. Yeah, and he just wasn't paying attention and he was knocked it over

05:33.900 --> 05:39.180
Yeah, the B was not in involved at that about and I just say guys as someone who didn't watch it

05:39.180 --> 05:45.220
Which I hope is the majority of our audience right now. You haven't mentioned anything that wasn't also in the trailer

05:45.220 --> 05:46.660
Yeah

05:46.660 --> 05:48.660
Yeah, I will say this

05:48.700 --> 05:50.820
good trailer in terms of

05:51.660 --> 05:56.700
representative cross-section of the experience that you're gonna be in for which is to say flimsy man make a

05:56.900 --> 06:01.420
Accident then the trailer did a great great job of selling that

06:01.420 --> 06:04.780
Hey Griffin, go be someone and tell me all about the first episode of man VB. I

06:05.460 --> 06:08.360
Watched more than one episode. Oh, then tell me as much as you want to tell me

06:09.020 --> 06:13.700
It have you ever watched the television program or films? Mr. Bean? Yes

06:13.700 --> 06:17.660
I have okay, it's it's that and you know how mr. Bean is is

06:18.580 --> 06:23.060
flimsy man make an accident over and over and over again and talk talk a little oh

06:23.420 --> 06:28.140
This time he talks kind of normal still of a very sort of like obsequious

06:28.940 --> 06:30.900
little wretch

06:30.900 --> 06:35.860
Whose family fucking hates him? Yeah, and everyone hates him. He's a he's a house sitter

06:35.860 --> 06:43.780
He shows up to this house and the owners of the house are like open the door. We hate you. We hate you. We don't know you

06:43.780 --> 06:49.340
You're not a normal guy. Whose name is Trevor, I think or no his name is trap unless there's a second Trevor

06:49.660 --> 06:53.660
We are we are meant to revile these rich out of touch

06:54.380 --> 06:58.420
douchebags because their house is so nice and their car is so nice and

06:58.540 --> 07:03.620
They're but here's but the market has placed a value on the work that they do clearly

07:03.620 --> 07:07.220
That has allowed them to accomplish this lifestyle

07:07.860 --> 07:09.620
everything they say

07:09.620 --> 07:14.120
About the flimsy bean man is a hundred percent, right? Yeah

07:15.500 --> 07:21.700
You're gonna fucking kill our dog. It's gonna shit all over the house. It's gonna destroy our our Gutenberg Bible

07:21.700 --> 07:23.700
It's gonna fucking wreck our Jaguar

07:23.940 --> 07:30.940
It's gonna destroy our lives that we've worked so hard in the market has allowed us the beautiful free market has allowed

07:30.940 --> 07:35.260
To achieve and you're gonna destroy that and we the viewers are supposed to be like

07:36.100 --> 07:39.940
Fuck him up bean. I'm about to like

07:40.700 --> 07:45.140
No, he's a bad. He's a bad man. And he makes so many accidents and

07:45.900 --> 07:50.100
He sucks and the show sucks and I had a shitty time watching now

07:50.100 --> 07:56.260
The problem with it is that he bean is a narcissist bean is a bad person who only care now

07:56.260 --> 07:59.580
Are you talking about Rowan bean or Trevor? I'm talking about bean

07:59.580 --> 08:01.580
Trevor is

08:01.980 --> 08:08.060
Painted as like a nice guy. So these terrible things happen to him. Wait, hold on jump back in your mind

08:08.060 --> 08:15.340
Mr. Bean is a narcissist clearly hundred percent. Whoa. Terrible person. Yeah. Whoa. He's a really bad person

08:15.620 --> 08:20.460
Watch the Christmas episode. I mean you you have his girlfriend comes over

08:20.700 --> 08:24.100
He gives her a picture of two other people

08:24.100 --> 08:29.740
He as soon as she gives him his gift he immediately takes it and starts opening it

08:29.820 --> 08:35.240
Like he only cares about himself the test episode. Okay, he's copping off the other person. He's you know, he's

08:37.580 --> 08:45.540
Even the my flexible friend Sam making a sandwich on a park bench. He is clearly making that other gentleman deeply in every episode

08:45.540 --> 08:48.500
Mr. Bean makes a different gentleman deeply uncomfortable

08:48.500 --> 08:54.660
He doesn't give a shit sucks Trevor is is supposed that we're supposed to be on his side

08:54.660 --> 09:01.420
But the problem is when calamity occurs and my friends it does mostly be be related

09:02.460 --> 09:04.460
It makes you

09:04.460 --> 09:06.460
It makes you not feel good

09:07.980 --> 09:10.460
Like I feel this is sad old

09:12.460 --> 09:16.940
This how okay the first episode of this show is so what we joke in

09:16.940 --> 09:18.940
but the Paul Blart

09:19.660 --> 09:25.740
Podcast till death was part about Chekhov's gun show where he literally like goes to a gun show and he's like

09:25.740 --> 09:27.740
Here's all the different guns

09:27.900 --> 09:34.620
That you will you will be using later in this movie. This movie is maybe more

09:35.740 --> 09:40.940
ostentatious than that with it's like what up where they go step by step to this house and it's like

09:41.500 --> 09:46.020
Here's this thing. Here's this other thing. You won't remember. Here's how the locks work

09:46.020 --> 09:51.460
Here's this special book that's worth a million dollars. Here's this special painting that's worth a million dollars

09:51.460 --> 09:53.740
Don't stand on that trapdoor the dog

09:53.740 --> 10:01.020
Yeah, exactly like the dog only eats this special beef or whatever and it's like so this is just you're just I can't remember

10:01.020 --> 10:06.820
All this stuff. I know being camp, but then they're like, it's all in the manual. It's all in the house manual

10:06.820 --> 10:12.780
It's all in the manual. It's all in the manual fucking five minutes in you know, this guy has the manual on the stove

10:12.780 --> 10:16.620
I just like lighting it on fire and we've all been there

10:16.780 --> 10:23.460
It's not on purpose, but it might as well be for how easily it could have been avoided and I will say this

10:24.180 --> 10:29.680
There's a lot of nude being in this film. Oh my god, we keep saying film. This is a 10 episode

10:30.580 --> 10:32.580
maxi series

10:32.580 --> 10:38.700
But I assume it's like a serial where you could watch all of them together. They could put it into a

10:38.700 --> 10:42.420
film eventually if they wanted to show it at Sundance

10:42.700 --> 10:45.300
Absolutely, they could show this at Sundance for sure

10:46.700 --> 10:51.940
Bit in in this show go off where he he tears it

10:52.620 --> 10:54.540
So there's a soundproof room

10:54.540 --> 10:57.020
White dog gets in there and starts tearing up a book

10:57.140 --> 11:02.340
He hits a window with a hammer to smash in through the window to keep the book from being more destroyed

11:02.340 --> 11:07.620
The hammer bounces off the window flies into a painting that's like modern art

11:07.620 --> 11:12.940
You know to me like color blocks that kind of thing. Yeah rips a big chunk out of the painting. Okay. Yeah

11:13.660 --> 11:15.500
so

11:15.500 --> 11:22.460
He they're gonna be gone for a week. He's been there for like 10 minutes, right and this happened

11:22.940 --> 11:26.620
He the man cuts a section of the couch

11:27.420 --> 11:31.660
The bottom of the couch where there's like fabric. Yeah cuts it out

11:32.260 --> 11:35.500
Then the color block that was torn is just like a big red square

11:35.500 --> 11:40.540
So cuts it out paints it red with ketchup

11:41.300 --> 11:43.300
Yeah, huh and

11:43.860 --> 11:45.340
then

11:45.340 --> 11:48.100
duct tapes it on to the back of the paint like

11:49.260 --> 11:54.420
That's why being you had time to go to the paint you could go to a paint store

11:54.420 --> 11:57.100
You could take it to an art restorer and they would actually

11:57.980 --> 12:02.300
Somebody to more importantly in the 1997 film beam

12:02.300 --> 12:08.500
Uh-huh destroys a very famous painting the Mona Lisa. Yes. It's not the Mona Lisa. It is the Mona Lisa

12:08.500 --> 12:12.980
I don't think it's the Mona Lisa. I'm pretty sure it is because I think he erases the face

12:13.740 --> 12:18.940
He does erase the face, but I'm pretty sure it's not the Mona Lisa the screen. It's Whistler's mother. Oh

12:20.340 --> 12:25.820
Yes, he restores it using like toothpaste in a clever

12:25.820 --> 12:33.220
Clever series and then he gets a poster and like lacquers over it to make it look like so we've done this

12:34.100 --> 12:37.060
Accident before with you. We've done this

12:38.540 --> 12:40.540
Job being did a better job

12:40.700 --> 12:46.420
Job, and can I also just say pretty challenging stuff? I mean, it's pretty the victim here

12:47.100 --> 12:48.420
offended as

12:48.420 --> 12:54.260
Like fuck and then it was and then I remember what he said about that. That's a good thing. Yeah

12:54.260 --> 12:58.460
That's what it's supposed to be difference here is you don't have Peter McNichol being

12:59.660 --> 13:06.240
Holding it down. Look looking like bean. I'm flipping out right now his reactions to bean flipping

13:06.260 --> 13:12.940
That's the issue with man versus be they don't give nobody Rowan Atkinson to work with except a CGI be Peter McNichol is over here

13:12.940 --> 13:14.340
like

13:14.340 --> 13:19.760
I love fucking Peter McNichol. I don't know his performances. I love his performances

13:19.760 --> 13:26.120
Wild to think to use the thing of like oh in that comedy film Peter McNichol plays

13:26.120 --> 13:33.080
The straight man is a wild like that's how that's how silly we're all straight men. That's right

13:33.080 --> 13:35.880
Well, hey, mr. Bean doesn't believe in homosexuality

13:39.440 --> 13:45.320
Challenging man, you're right Justin. He's challenging but it's true. I will say this he was right about one thing

13:45.320 --> 13:51.640
This show is a weapon and Netflix is holding it in its hand and it's sitting in the now trending charts

13:51.760 --> 13:58.500
Fucking cocked and loaded and if you see you honey, we finished stranger things. What next? Well next in the

13:58.920 --> 14:05.600
Hot section is a show called man versus be that might be a good way to kind of decompress a little bit

14:05.600 --> 14:08.000
We're all really stressed out about hopper over here

14:08.400 --> 14:14.120
And then you watch man versus be and you've been killed by the this psychic weapon

14:14.120 --> 14:18.600
I feel like it seems like Netflix was like hey you guys like stranger things, right?

14:18.600 --> 14:24.180
Yeah, you'd like the final two episodes of the season. Well first you're gonna have to watch

14:24.800 --> 14:27.360
Fucking vegetables. It's like up. It's like

14:28.400 --> 14:31.280
What was um, what was the Mullen use thing?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
goddess

14:33.120 --> 14:36.760
Yeah, the what's in the box where you everyone had to tap curiosity

14:36.760 --> 14:44.640
Everyone had to tap this box a bajillion times and never tapped at the bajillionth time. We get an incredible that's

14:44.960 --> 14:47.640
Like everyone has so if you want the rest of stranger things

14:47.640 --> 14:52.680
Everyone has to watch the rest of man versus be a million times. I don't want to talk about this anymore

14:52.680 --> 14:55.880
I mean, I don't want to talk about man versus be ever again confront you with the reality

14:56.000 --> 15:01.600
No, here's it. Here's what sucks shit though is we are gonna have to talk about it again cuz Travis has to watch it

15:01.600 --> 15:06.160
Oh Travis, I will never us. Yeah, our audience will never forgive you for this

15:06.160 --> 15:11.280
I'm saying I was busy. I had things to do I cut my finger with a head trimmer

15:11.280 --> 15:13.280
I just didn't have you do that

15:13.280 --> 15:18.680
Did you do that like a fucking Vietnam War deferment so that you did not have to watch?

15:18.680 --> 15:23.720
I just finished reading a prayer for own meaning and I was like, you know what? I know how to get out of great idea

15:23.720 --> 15:29.360
Yeah, okay. I would can I say this I would gladly shear my finger off to not watch another I didn't shear it off

15:29.360 --> 15:34.000
Let's be clear. She had into it. All right, that's man versus be that's our segment

15:34.000 --> 15:37.920
I would love to hear your thoughts about it in the comments. I'm gonna go ahead and say this

15:37.920 --> 15:42.600
I will continue to talk about it in every episode until Travis's watches

15:43.680 --> 15:50.840
Entirely, hey Justin. Hey Justin, which one of us has more of a stomach for a long unfunny bit

15:50.840 --> 15:56.840
But one of us craves the love and adoration of the the the listeners most I

15:57.680 --> 16:01.980
Think you'll be the villain. You're the you are the villain Travis. Okay, you are a villain

16:01.980 --> 16:07.820
So am I the man or the bee in this scenario? You're the man who is the villain? Oh boy is good

16:07.860 --> 16:11.180
So just there's a scene in the second episode

16:11.300 --> 16:17.220
There's a scene in the second episode where he devises a trap where he puts some bread with peanut butter on it in a microwave

16:17.220 --> 16:22.000
Beast floats in there gets stuck in the peanut butter and he shuts the microwave and is ready to turn it on and cook it

16:22.000 --> 16:27.860
And he doesn't what's your fucking how is that not the end of the show? How is that? Not the end of the show?

16:27.860 --> 16:29.400
Does he chicken out?

16:29.400 --> 16:33.540
He doesn't want to kill the bee and it's like why would I continue to watch this show?

16:33.540 --> 16:38.060
If you don't even have the strengths of your conviction, I can't believe but also the bee stuck on the bear

16:38.060 --> 16:42.620
Just put it outside. He does and the bee flies back into that. Well, okay, okay

16:42.660 --> 16:48.180
This is an advice show as you've certainly guessed by this this this moment

16:49.680 --> 16:57.180
So, thank you for joining us yet again for this for this program or maybe you didn't it's quite possible you're not here

16:57.180 --> 17:02.460
Yeah, well think about it. My wife's friend was hosting a can I stand?

17:03.180 --> 17:04.740
my wife's man

17:04.740 --> 17:10.060
My wife's friend was hosting a Canadian Thanksgiving party. It was gay, which is usually like October

17:10.060 --> 17:17.020
This is no one knows there. No, I'm sorry. I'm telling you. I once had it's a 44th Thursday of every year

17:17.020 --> 17:22.220
Mm-hmm. I once had Canadian Thanksgiving in Honduras because there are some Canadians there was great. Guess what they eat

17:22.220 --> 17:29.420
Turkey. Oh, it was getting a bit late and I wanted to get our six-month-old son down for bed

17:29.500 --> 17:33.420
Been there. Everyone wanted to get some photos with the kiddo before we took off

17:33.660 --> 17:38.660
He started to get a little agitated at the commotion. So I tried to bounce him a bit and kissed his fuzzy little head

17:39.000 --> 17:40.500
He was having none of it

17:40.500 --> 17:44.340
So we got as many pics as we could I shuffled him off home as I was putting him in his crib

17:44.340 --> 17:47.380
I came to the realization that instead of gently kissing my sweet baby boy on the head

17:47.380 --> 17:52.700
I may have kissed my Canadian bro-y friend's neck as

17:53.140 --> 17:55.860
He was standing next to us in the photo

17:57.500 --> 17:58.660
I

17:58.660 --> 18:05.700
Haven't spoken to him much since then but I'm haunted by the idea of my softly kiss the peach fuzz on my buddy's neck and not

18:05.700 --> 18:07.700
Immediately recognize this is not my baby

18:08.020 --> 18:13.500
Do I ask him if he felt anything strange during the photos or do I continue to act like nothing?

18:13.500 --> 18:18.580
Happened and this is a guess la la lips la lips

18:18.660 --> 18:21.760
It's hard to say if every question that was sent to us

18:22.420 --> 18:24.420
That was sort of a toss-up like this

18:25.980 --> 18:27.180
Included

18:27.180 --> 18:28.680
photographic evidence

18:28.680 --> 18:34.160
Then this show would be so much easier to to yeah, but then anyone would do a Griffin if it was easy

18:34.660 --> 18:41.420
Anyone would do it. I'm just saying look at the look at this photograph. I'm kissing my buddy Derek's neck

18:41.420 --> 18:49.100
I thought it was a baby's head. How do you confuse a baby's head with a grown adult looks like baby's head

18:49.100 --> 18:56.320
I guess so because maybe Derek moisturizes a lot and he had six months of beard growth and it was equal to

18:56.820 --> 19:02.960
Six months of baby hair growth. Let let's just would it be safe to assume because if you didn't kiss Derek's neck

19:03.260 --> 19:08.820
Then we don't need to proceed any further, right? So if we're assuming you can't we must assume

19:08.820 --> 19:13.240
So let me say this Derek in the moment also didn't say anything

19:13.680 --> 19:20.440
Sure, right. So maybe maybe there's not as pro as you think maybe it was just a nice note between friends. It was intimate

19:20.760 --> 19:25.640
You know, it's just like oh, this is not you know, what we never show each other affection like this. This is very nice

19:25.640 --> 19:30.680
Thank you. I love it. I love it. Let's bring back platonic intimacy, please

19:30.680 --> 19:39.760
Yes, thank you. Thank you. I mean sorry not for me. Thanks. Oh, yeah doesn't care for any intimacy

19:39.760 --> 19:43.240
What's over? Oh, that's not true. I'm a real sex monster

19:43.240 --> 19:50.480
But I don't want it I but what but that's in a very specific place, which is to say my my Christian bed

19:51.320 --> 19:53.320
uh-huh outside of that I'm

19:53.320 --> 20:00.480
No, none for me. Thanks. So you guys you guys kissing each other's necks. I'm I'm fine over here, but keep it up

20:00.600 --> 20:05.540
You look happy. I'm happy. So if Justin or I if we had like a really great live show

20:06.040 --> 20:11.400
Yeah came backstage and everyone was like a great live show and Justin and I wanted to share a round of like brother kisses

20:11.400 --> 20:14.820
On the neck. Yeah, you would abstain. I wouldn't be there

20:15.360 --> 20:18.800
There would be good you well when I I would know the vibe

20:18.800 --> 20:24.080
Was leading in the direction of platonic intimacy and I would probably just like squirrel myself

20:24.080 --> 20:29.480
So wait as we walked to the dressing room holding hands like we always do at the end of live shows you would break off

20:29.720 --> 20:36.160
No, I told you that's not that's that's just brother stuff. Okay, and this is not like it's not like a homophobic thing

20:36.160 --> 20:42.340
It's just a I'm good on platonic intimacy over here. Yeah, if some of any gender

20:42.340 --> 20:49.660
Of any sort of gender spectrum, you're not loving the platonic intimacy. I'm just not really ba-da-ba-ba-ba. No, thanks

20:53.180 --> 20:57.620
Yep, yeah, you know what now that you said it and I think yeah, that's yeah, that's Griffin

20:57.620 --> 21:05.100
That sounds about right. It's a topic that that I feel like we've glanced off of before but I do feel like merits exploration

21:05.380 --> 21:07.380
is that oh

21:07.380 --> 21:12.980
Justin we're recording video for the first time and I can see Justin tinting his fingers. It's very

21:15.140 --> 21:17.140
Solve this the Frasier

21:19.500 --> 21:23.820
Also got video look at these little Frasier pop. I got a Frasier pop

21:24.180 --> 21:27.220
Okay, okay, and then I got a Martin and Eddie pop still

21:28.380 --> 21:30.380
Niles is the chase

21:31.580 --> 21:33.580
There is a these things

21:33.580 --> 21:39.620
Uh-huh. They go they go rotten when you leave them in the fridge of

21:41.220 --> 21:42.940
Of not

21:42.940 --> 21:48.300
Confronting them they go they go rotten and then this this this topic

21:48.900 --> 21:55.420
Has it has gone it has gone fallow now. It is it you can't do this anymore

21:55.420 --> 22:00.580
You can't return to it. You bring things to us. You have to start getting the habit of

22:00.580 --> 22:07.540
of anticipating these situations and emailing us before you are I'm going to a Thanksgiving a

22:07.620 --> 22:12.000
Canadian Thanksgiving party and I feel there might be a chance. I might get my

22:12.580 --> 22:16.700
Friend on the neck. My friend has a patch of hair on his neck

22:17.340 --> 22:19.860
That and there's also a sort of weird

22:20.780 --> 22:27.120
Soft bone plate in there. Anyway, it really looks like a baby's head. Yeah, and I want to kiss it

22:27.120 --> 22:30.940
I just can't help myself. I think here's like this is

22:31.540 --> 22:37.340
There's a good chance that you could ask your bro friend. Like did I kiss you on the neck while we're taking photos?

22:37.340 --> 22:43.140
I was so tired. I've got six months old. You can't now this is what I'm saying. Oh, yeah

22:43.140 --> 22:43.300
No

22:43.300 --> 22:47.460
It's long past you have to do it the instant it happens because it's going to seed

22:47.660 --> 22:54.500
Like it from the moment you don't discuss it. It is like one of those time-lapse videos of a Fox decomposing

22:54.500 --> 22:59.900
Like yeah, you have to address it in that exact moment. Don't hold back. You'll figure it out

22:59.900 --> 23:04.180
Once again, not because if you had accidentally to kiss them on the neck, they'll be the weirdest thing

23:04.180 --> 23:08.180
But I would say anything like this the longer it goes

23:08.540 --> 23:16.500
The weirder it is to then ask about later right because it's like what he indicates is I have been thinking about this

23:16.940 --> 23:21.880
Right on stop tragedy plus time equals comedy. Yeah tragedy plus comedy equals time

23:21.880 --> 23:24.520
Yes awkwardness plus time

23:25.280 --> 23:26.680
equals

23:26.680 --> 23:33.640
Weirder like it just I I actually think comedy plus time does equal tragedy where it's like you make a joke or something funny happens

23:33.640 --> 23:35.640
And it would be funny in that moment

23:35.640 --> 23:41.720
Yeah, but then it's sad too long. Yeah, I was like, you know is a joke. Was that funny? Was it weird?

23:41.720 --> 23:46.440
It's like oh, no, we've thought about the funny thing too long and now it's horrifying

23:46.440 --> 23:53.780
like when I see mr. Bean in 1995 gives clothes torn off and he's got his naked bean dick and he's just running around a

23:53.780 --> 23:56.280
Swimming pool and I'm watching that like busting up

24:00.080 --> 24:06.640
But then a full-grown bean almost 30 30 years later does it cuz a bee chased him out of his house and that's

24:06.840 --> 24:13.180
Tragedy now because time has made it tragedy. Is he allergic to bees in this show? It's not addressed

24:13.180 --> 24:17.620
In the early episodes that Griffin has enjoyed Travis will have to report back to us

24:18.340 --> 24:22.660
Hey, I have something for us today and it's a special something

24:22.660 --> 24:28.340
I was looking through wiki house and I stumbled on an email that Ethan sent us. Thank you, Ethan. Thank you, Ethan and it's

24:29.020 --> 24:32.100
It's a it's it's from a website called

24:33.260 --> 24:39.400
Holidapi, which I believe is a mixture of the word portmanteau of the words holiday and happy

24:39.400 --> 24:45.360
And holidapi this article has a lot of helpful tips for us

24:45.360 --> 24:53.400
Can I just say that's a that's a portmanteau? That's terrible. That's not how you have to say that in doing portmanteau is itself

24:54.080 --> 24:56.080
Think about that

24:56.240 --> 25:02.940
So holidapi has composed here a list of happy Independence Day messages and wishes that we can send each other and our loved ones

25:03.440 --> 25:05.080
to

25:05.080 --> 25:10.720
Celebrate the good times great oldies and this incredible country

25:13.320 --> 25:20.460
This kick-ass country that we live in and how we can send messages to each other on on Independence Day to really

25:20.840 --> 25:23.340
Acknowledge that a Griffin might have proposed a game

25:23.880 --> 25:27.160
Sure. Sure. What if you read the message, right?

25:27.160 --> 25:33.720
Okay, and then we counted to three and all three of us said who in our life we think would send that message to us

25:33.720 --> 25:39.140
Oh, no, no this game won't work and I'll tell you why they're all noni. Can I begin? Ah, damn it. Okay, go on

25:40.040 --> 25:47.400
Short greetings for text messages. So just like and this doesn't it's not just for us this this episode

25:47.400 --> 25:50.280
I don't know if we're putting this out on our usual day if we do it is

25:50.760 --> 25:53.080
July 4th right now when you're listening to this

25:53.760 --> 25:58.200
So go ahead and snap off a few of these and just like shoot them over to your buds and see

25:58.880 --> 26:01.640
What you get back from let's salute the nation

26:01.640 --> 26:07.960
That's a test. That's one. That's the first one and that sounds like weirdly like making plans for something

26:07.960 --> 26:13.720
Doesn't it? Like that's not just like hey happy for that's like let's do so. Hey, what are you doing right now?

26:14.280 --> 26:17.320
Let's go salute the nation when you salute the nation

26:17.320 --> 26:21.880
Do you just do you look do you look at the down at the ground or do you just try to shoot?

26:21.880 --> 26:28.760
You lay down you lay down face down with your hand between your forehead and the dirt. That's good. That's good

26:28.760 --> 26:33.360
That's good. So the second one escalates a little bit in that it says I

26:33.480 --> 26:38.000
Pledged that the labor of our past heroes shall not be in vain Wow

26:38.680 --> 26:40.000
Wow

26:40.000 --> 26:43.200
Wow, hey, hey, hey Wow

26:43.960 --> 26:50.120
Also, not necessarily what the 4th of July is about. Yeah, I think you're thinking more Memorial Day

26:50.120 --> 26:53.960
That's more of a Memorial Day. Can you can you bring hot dog buns to the cookout?

26:53.960 --> 26:58.840
Thank you. I pledged that the labor of our past heroes shall not be in vain is the kid

26:58.840 --> 27:02.120
I asked a pretty simple question about the hot dog buns

27:02.360 --> 27:06.640
That's also a thing you could say after watching a lot of Marvel movies, too. Uh-huh. Yeah

27:06.640 --> 27:11.200
Uh-huh. You could also say something like I feel proud to be part of a prosperous nation

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
Well, well

27:14.760 --> 27:19.200
Followed up by Happy Independence Day. Yeah didn't start there though, huh?

27:19.200 --> 27:25.240
Nothing nothing is as good as living in an independent and self-sustaining nation

27:25.240 --> 27:27.560
Well, what are you talking about?

27:28.320 --> 27:34.240
Doesn't mean anything you mean our self-sustaining nation that worries about our wheat supply oil supply

27:35.520 --> 27:39.040
Nation that when boats can get her from China start choking on its own puke

27:39.040 --> 27:46.920
That doesn't have enough doesn't have microchips to make things we're doing it

27:48.480 --> 27:52.700
Computers that we have trucks sitting in factories that don't have chips in them

27:53.600 --> 27:59.240
Our one gubernatorial douchebag just strangles the entire avocado pipeline

27:59.680 --> 28:01.800
What is what a beautiful self-sustaining?

28:01.800 --> 28:09.200
Self-sustaining we don't need anybody else. Nah, baby. We got it. Hey best wishes and Happy Independence Day

28:09.240 --> 28:14.160
Here's wishing you have a Happy Independence Day. Happy birthday to our dear country

28:14.320 --> 28:16.820
Let's remember all the past heroes who fought for our freedom

28:18.040 --> 28:25.040
Okay. Okay. I love our past heroes. Let me say yeah, we're a hero and in the past wild about it

28:25.040 --> 28:29.560
Yeah, yeah, I feel like they do have a day. That's their day

28:29.560 --> 28:33.180
You know, I mean the ones that are past heroes and current heroes

28:33.880 --> 28:36.720
Days like they both we were being honest

28:36.720 --> 28:43.200
These messages would be like and let's salute the idea of signing a piece of paper because really that's I mean come on

28:43.280 --> 28:47.040
There's always got to be somebody though. If you try to say what 4th of July is

28:47.600 --> 28:52.800
There's always somebody who's like no, it's not actually that it's like the sign of that crucial independence

28:52.800 --> 28:57.560
and then there's always gotta be some some Joker who's like actually is the day that the

28:57.560 --> 28:59.040
the

28:59.040 --> 29:06.800
Continental Congress announced that the different papers have been signed you you bring up such a great point doesn't why is the Joker so pedantic about

29:06.920 --> 29:14.080
History. Yeah, I've never understood that thing. I'm like, ah, yes Batman. I will get you also not everybody signed the

29:14.560 --> 29:17.960
Declaration on the fourth actually a lot of people signed it

29:18.800 --> 29:22.960
It was red. That's the worst. Hey Trav. That's the worst Joker impression. I ever heard. Thank you

29:22.960 --> 29:29.200
I'm trying to it's a new take for the Joker that I'm trying where he's both the clown prince of crime, but also

29:29.880 --> 29:32.520
the clown prince of factual accuracy

29:33.240 --> 29:34.240
Yeah

29:34.240 --> 29:41.880
If somebody does come at you with that very pedantic correction just hit him back with a may God continue to uplift this country's glory

29:42.320 --> 29:45.600
Is that what he's been doing? I miss that. Oh

29:46.480 --> 29:48.480
Man, where have I been looking?

29:49.040 --> 29:51.040
Hit him with a very straightforward

29:51.040 --> 29:55.560
Right forward right over the plate today is a very special day for the nation and its people

29:56.240 --> 30:03.680
Well, yeah, I would then I would just send that every day for a while because it's probably true whether good or bad

30:03.880 --> 30:07.320
There's probably something happening on that date. That feels pretty major

30:07.480 --> 30:12.880
Yeah, here's wishing you and your family the best the nation has to offer as we celebrate our country's independence

30:12.920 --> 30:17.280
So like some five guys is sure is that what you mean?

30:17.280 --> 30:21.440
It's just some five guys in a national park go eat some five guys in a national park

30:21.440 --> 30:27.060
That's assuming it's open because they could get staffing for it. They could that could be an issue

30:27.080 --> 30:30.060
Those are texts but you all know

30:30.680 --> 30:32.000
me

30:32.000 --> 30:39.840
I don't like I don't like to text. Yeah feels very like so cold cold and impersonal. I like a car robotic

30:40.080 --> 30:41.600
these are some

30:41.600 --> 30:43.320
slightly more

30:43.320 --> 30:50.960
Thoughtful longer messages that you could write in a car. I love getting cards from Griffin. Yeah, like I'll get a card over a few days

30:50.960 --> 30:57.720
It's like hey, I'm hopping on fortnight. Let's go or like yeah. Hey, you're late for this. The postcard. It's like hey

30:57.840 --> 31:04.680
What size t-shirt do you wear? Do you know? Yeah, or like can we reschedule today's recording because I have diarrhea again. Yeah. Yeah

31:06.040 --> 31:10.800
Do you guys remember that greeting card? I got you both and it had like a cute

31:10.800 --> 31:18.080
Cartoon firework on the front of it. And then when you open it up inside the card, it already had written

31:18.880 --> 31:27.000
Baby, you're a firework. Happy 4th of July. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, and then underneath underneath that I wrote myself

31:27.080 --> 31:33.180
I added the future progress and development of our great country do not depend solely on technological advancements

31:33.180 --> 31:38.200
But how we build social cohesion and trust between our nation and its people let's continue building a great nation

31:38.200 --> 31:43.200
We can all rely on and be proud of happy 4th of July. I'm Griffin McElroy, and I approve this message

31:44.840 --> 31:46.200
What yeah

31:46.200 --> 31:51.760
And then there was the one with the cartoon grill on it and it says you're a you're a barbecued e

31:51.880 --> 31:54.540
Happy 4th of July. Yeah, and underneath that

31:54.960 --> 31:58.800
I wrote every citizen should have a sense of belonging wherever they find themselves

31:58.800 --> 32:04.760
May all our politicians rise to the great task of building trust between the people in the nation so we can have peace and stability

32:04.760 --> 32:09.340
In our country. Here's wishing everyone a happy Freedom Day celebration. I do remember that

32:09.340 --> 32:13.100
I did think it was weird that it was written in cutout letters for magazines

32:13.180 --> 32:18.140
But other than that, it was really now I liked the sentiment. Do we call it Freedom Day?

32:18.140 --> 32:24.860
I do not believe so. Futurama does. Is this person confusing real life with Futurama?

32:24.860 --> 32:31.380
Perhaps they're conflating real life with Futurama. That does happen. Yeah, those are just some normal things to write inside of a greeting card

32:31.380 --> 32:34.380
and

32:37.260 --> 32:41.020
This is a this is my favorite one as we mark our insert number

32:41.660 --> 32:47.480
Independence Day today try to think of something that you have done to better the welfare of the people if nothing comes to mind

32:47.480 --> 32:50.100
Then try to think of what you might be able to do in the future

32:50.780 --> 32:52.700
Happy Independence Day

32:52.700 --> 32:55.400
Just a little home for you. That sounds like a card

32:55.820 --> 33:00.100
That sounds like a card a funeral home would send you to thank you for your business. Yeah

33:00.100 --> 33:07.100
Yeah, you got on their mailing list and it's like what there's a tiny calendar that you have no use for whatsoever and a card

33:07.380 --> 33:11.980
Asking you what you've done for the nation. Hey, I'm gonna play this is a quick math challenge

33:11.980 --> 33:16.260
I'm gonna count to three and then you guys say how many years we like since

33:17.500 --> 33:21.420
1776 worth of joy. You ready? One, two, three go

33:21.420 --> 33:28.900
Three hundred and fifty four hundred forty some Wow. Yeah, it's it's three hundred and fifty four. I think

33:30.180 --> 33:32.180
354 and 54

33:33.160 --> 33:35.160
Griffin

33:35.900 --> 33:37.540
354

33:37.540 --> 33:39.540
17 to 21

33:39.860 --> 33:44.860
30 I said 240 I felt pretty good about that. 240 is pretty close

33:45.740 --> 33:48.940
240 is pretty close. I believe it's 246

33:48.940 --> 33:55.020
You didn't give me you didn't give me a lot of time, but you went with 300. You couldn't do simple

33:56.140 --> 34:01.140
300 Griffin already puts it at 2076. It's your common core, bud

34:06.700 --> 34:08.860
300 is obviously a bad start

34:10.580 --> 34:12.860
That's obviously the wrong start

34:12.860 --> 34:19.060
A two is a front and then any number afterwards would have been excusable. Yeah, okay

34:20.900 --> 34:22.900
Yeah 17

34:23.540 --> 34:26.300
was was the start of it right and

34:27.260 --> 34:29.260
20 is where ours starts now

34:29.940 --> 34:35.860
17 plus 20 300 I can see how you would get there. It's not it's not that 17 plus 20 is 300

34:35.860 --> 34:37.860
I think we all can all at least agree with that

34:37.860 --> 34:43.460
Do you guys remember the greeting card I sent you that had the cartoon American flag on the front of it?

34:43.460 --> 34:49.080
And it said looking good in Stars and Stripes, baby. Happy Independence Day, and then underneath that I wrote each time

34:49.080 --> 34:54.760
I remember those who laid down their lives for this day of freedom. We are celebrating tears rolled down my cheeks

34:54.760 --> 34:58.980
I wish they were alive today to see how the country is progressing toward greatness

34:58.980 --> 35:05.800
I'm actually not getting any of your cards because every time you turn around my house number it just says 777 333 blue

35:05.800 --> 35:10.860
It's like no grip. That's a holy holy incomplete understanding of arithmetic

35:11.460 --> 35:13.860
Listen, I know we've talked about it before on the show

35:13.860 --> 35:16.860
But if someone could snap their fingers and the founding fathers will be alive today

35:16.980 --> 35:24.300
They would not care about where our country's that they'd be terrified at everything out TVs cars

35:24.540 --> 35:26.060
Okay, maybe

35:26.060 --> 35:30.220
Is it our old gags to try to use them for new for new purposes?

35:30.220 --> 35:33.920
I would take a blink in and go see that new Jurassic World movie and he'd be like

35:33.920 --> 35:38.320
The whole time like like hiding under the chair fucking idiot

35:40.240 --> 35:47.240
Wouldn't you love to actually like if you got people from a certain time period I don't know when this would be like say Shakespeare

35:47.240 --> 35:52.440
times yeah, okay what and you brought him into the future and everybody's like, you know, I would take him to

35:53.400 --> 35:56.140
Steak and shake or whatever like I don't have it, you know

35:56.880 --> 35:58.880
Or whatever. I would I was shown TV

35:58.880 --> 36:05.680
The best thing to do is somebody from that time period would be or guess any biblical times

36:05.680 --> 36:12.680
Whatever would be to tell them about dinosaurs. Yeah, and then instantly tell them they don't exist anymore

36:12.680 --> 36:18.240
Yeah, like hey, guess what dinosaurs like oh shit, you let them go on for like a half hour

36:18.320 --> 36:23.160
You're showing them all the sick-ass like videos and photos that we have of dinosaurs

36:23.160 --> 36:30.640
From the media and then at just at the right moment. You're like, but they don't exist. Yeah. Sorry, but sorry

36:30.640 --> 36:34.360
And then send them right back and then they're right back there at the desk

36:34.720 --> 36:41.040
But go go start digging for bones. You never know. Yeah. Hey, can we go digging for some bones in the money bone? Oh

Online shopping. It's how I find all my little tchotchkes

39:06.220 --> 39:11.380
All my little doodads, you know what? I like I like those little garden gnomes, but they're

39:12.420 --> 39:18.380
Fans of a sports team, you know those get all those wonderful toys. I get them online Griffin

I'm telling you right now, but the garden gnomes that look like they're like, I love the bingles

39:22.180 --> 39:28.180
Yeah, right those garden gnomes and they're what if Batman did get all of his doodads and gadgets just from wish.com

39:28.180 --> 39:30.540

It finds your cart like say you were buying like batarangs in bulk, right?

39:46.040 --> 39:50.900
Cuz once you throw them, they're pretty much gone. I like you never see Batman going around and picking them back up

39:50.900 --> 39:53.980
They'll never fly the same again after they ding off of a wall

39:53.980 --> 39:58.420
You know, that's also true or once they like sever someone's artery, you know what I mean?

39:58.420 --> 40:02.540
They get a little rusty after that, right? So you want to buy what I don't think that's what he does

40:02.940 --> 40:08.700
Well, listen, he doesn't purposefully murder anyone, but he's not doing triage. You know, he's much like bean in that way

40:08.820 --> 40:09.780
Yes, thank you

40:09.780 --> 40:12.780
so you're shopping on one of your favorite sites batarangs calm and

when you check out the honey button appears and you click apply coupons and it finds all the battering coupons and

40:18.660 --> 40:22.500
Then you wait a few seconds and honey searches finds coupons for that site

40:22.500 --> 40:25.540
And then if it finds a working coupon, you'll watch the prices drop

40:25.540 --> 40:33.140
Listen Batman didn't get to be rich by paying full price for batarangs. If there's one thing I know about Batman

40:33.820 --> 40:39.380
Yeah, he didn't get rich by paying full price for batarangs. Just a huge kind of say

40:40.300 --> 40:42.660
Huge shout out if you go to batarangs

40:45.460 --> 40:47.460

Hell yes, it's just a place you go and it's it's a different website, but they didn't pay to be mentioned

40:58.220 --> 41:00.780
So whatever you just go to batarangs.com you can buy

41:01.620 --> 41:05.760

Buy any clothes for the kid right because the kids they're always getting bigger, right?

41:27.740 --> 41:33.780
It's great to use honey to save that money because kids grow out of these things so fast and it always feels bad paying money

41:33.780 --> 41:37.340
For them cuz you know pretty soon they won't fit anymore. And it's so good to save

41:37.340 --> 41:42.860

There's an amazing documentary about queer history on streaming

43:02.860 --> 43:08.140
Have I told you about this classic where giant robots fight or there's that one that most critics hated?

43:08.140 --> 43:15.020
But I thought was actually pretty good. Oh, I know the one with the huge car chase and then there's that scene where the car jumps

43:15.020 --> 43:21.780

A psychic. My name is psychic Carrie. I'm Ross. Oh, what a pleasure to meet you

43:45.220 --> 43:48.660
Of course, I knew your name was Ross as I am a psychic, but please take a seat

Yes, we investigate French science

43:58.820 --> 44:00.820

It sounds like it's been a real challenge for you lately. Actually, it's a lot of fun. Yes, exactly because it's so fun

I don't know how you this will be $75. Okay, that seems fair. Oh, no, Ross and Carrie at maximum fun

44:17.580 --> 44:20.740
Oh, you knew it was a dot org. I have a gift. I

44:22.820 --> 44:26.860
Just want to talk about like some personal justice or something you want to say

44:27.900 --> 44:29.220
Nope

44:29.220 --> 44:31.740
Okay, let's do another question. Okay, perfect. I

44:32.420 --> 44:35.380
Wanted to give you something in a row. I felt like there was a munchkrat coming

44:36.700 --> 44:42.340
Mmm-hmm. Guess I'm getting a little less predictable in my old age. Okay, I

44:42.940 --> 44:47.060
Paint apartments for a living while walking. I bet that's a very satisfying job

44:47.060 --> 44:50.540
Oh, especially if you're doing it like by yourself just put headphones on

44:51.460 --> 44:53.940
Especially if it's a nice clean job. No cutting in you just oh

44:53.940 --> 44:59.500
Oh, yeah, I paint apartments for a living. I bet it sucks when they don't move the furniture first

45:00.420 --> 45:04.260
They're like, yeah, you'll move it right and you're like no that I just pay. Oh my god

45:05.140 --> 45:07.140
Move your shit for a living. I

45:07.980 --> 45:12.980
What if they have a cat you paint the cat into the paint the cat into the wall sucks

45:12.980 --> 45:16.940
I've painted I love that book about how to write a movie called paint the cat

45:17.100 --> 45:20.860
But it's like that's how you establish like a bean character right away

45:20.860 --> 45:23.900
All right, if you want to establish this as a bean ask character

45:23.900 --> 45:27.300
Which we're all going apartments for only got to have them paint the cat apartments for a living

45:27.580 --> 45:30.660
While walking through the hallway to the apartment I was assigned

45:30.660 --> 45:33.660
I overheard the building is having an ice cream social later for the tenants

45:33.740 --> 45:39.100
Yes, you're gonna is having a heat wave. So the building has no the building has no AC. I love free food

45:39.940 --> 45:41.940
Is there an acceptable?

45:42.140 --> 45:47.700
Way for me to get some of this ice cream out of context the entire building is specifically for people 55 years and older

45:47.700 --> 45:51.340
So I'll be at least three decades younger younger than the rest of the people there

45:51.340 --> 45:56.820
And also I'm covered in paint and that's from melting in the Midwest. Okay, let me start with this

45:57.340 --> 46:00.100
so much to add here what kind of

46:00.740 --> 46:05.620
Cut-rate slumlord is like the old people are melting

46:06.140 --> 46:12.180
We need a see and then this slum or turns around his throne is like let them eat ice cream

46:12.180 --> 46:18.980
And then slams the door in their face. Yes. This is a bad building. They're spending money on

46:19.700 --> 46:20.820
repainting

46:20.820 --> 46:27.500
Before they preserve the temperature control for these poor old people. That's that's fucked up

46:28.860 --> 46:33.500
And let me say this these that I'm and I'm not gonna I'm gonna try my hardest

46:33.500 --> 46:36.420
I I don't want to propagate any sort of ages stereotypes

46:36.420 --> 46:42.900
But I will say that this 55 plus year old ice cream socials probably be rocking some pretty gnarly fucking

46:42.900 --> 46:49.980
Butterscotch briars and not the good shit not that fucking caramel core fucking Ben and Jerry's they are going to have some

46:50.300 --> 46:51.660
straight up

46:51.660 --> 46:58.380
Fucking right out the tub right out big old big old tub. That's a duty fruity out of the tub

46:58.460 --> 47:05.380
I've never rolled up to an ice cream social where I didn't see that like boom boom big like five gallon

47:05.380 --> 47:13.300
Bucket of just like signature select really pale chocolate versus every like just a tan chocolate or perhaps worse the

47:13.580 --> 47:17.700
Tiny fluted cups with the paper lid you have to peel off like it's a penny

47:17.700 --> 47:23.060
It's not it's not an arty and they have those like really cheap-ass waffle cones or they're not the way

47:23.060 --> 47:24.900
They're just like little hollow

47:24.900 --> 47:31.620
Dried out decayed husk of an actual ice cream cone. Oh bad news guys. I'm hungry for ice cream. Yeah

47:31.620 --> 47:33.620
Yeah, yeah

For ice cream, I got the kids some of those they're like the drumsticks, right?

47:38.940 --> 47:44.460
But they're like miniature and I know this is the perfect size. I can eat them in one fucking bite

47:46.700 --> 47:53.260
I'm a giant and I love ice cream. Yeah, I'm a giant and I love ice cream would be a good ringtone if anybody's still

47:54.780 --> 47:57.780
Okay, listen, all you gotta do is pick one

47:57.780 --> 48:02.940
Person and stick at this ice cream so she'll just kept saying like yeah

Get out of my building you play wait fuck dude. You call you play Call of Duty

48:39.700 --> 48:47.700
Nintendo games who makes you the screens the bezels that you use to get the different pixels running around America

That's who the work of sufficient land of ours, but I'm a worker. I'm a painter

But not like not one of those artsy painters. Don't get it twisted. Okay, I was yeah. Have you thrown out for a

49:01.140 --> 49:07.540
Homosexual now, I'm a real I'm a real like working painter. Can I have some ice cream, please?

49:08.100 --> 49:10.900
This is I could perhaps bear a

49:11.780 --> 49:14.260
Nubbin of pistachio. Oh, thank you

49:14.260 --> 49:20.260
This sucks, don't I deserve the ice cream for my work? No says the man in Washington

49:20.260 --> 49:24.260
You can't be my guy. That's no I was being sorry. I was being Andrew Ryan

49:24.260 --> 49:29.060
I've wanted us to get in the more characters. Okay, I want this to be my brother my brother me

49:29.060 --> 49:31.060
Okay, well, thank you. Sure

49:31.860 --> 49:35.780
But I was being Andrew Ryan were you also being Andrew Ryan I was old

49:36.100 --> 49:38.900
Alternate universe Andrew Ryan where I never stopped being Batman

49:38.900 --> 49:44.100
I I hate to be this guy because I try to like

49:44.980 --> 49:49.060
Stand on some pretty anti-capitalist like group footing most of the time

49:49.460 --> 49:55.620
But I will say this is one of those scenarios where you can get yourself a tub of shitty briars

49:55.620 --> 50:02.260
sure, but for about 250 at Sam's Club and then you don't have and then you don't and then you don't have to be

50:02.500 --> 50:05.300
In this situation, but it doesn't but he's working

50:05.300 --> 50:12.420
Bring it to work with what Griffin ice cream to work with you two things Griffin. Yeah, two things one

50:12.980 --> 50:14.740
It doesn't matter the price

50:14.740 --> 50:20.900
Free ice cream is better than paid for ice cream. Yeah, just like don't but to Griffin what you are fucking forgetting, dude

50:20.900 --> 50:27.300
Is this an ice cream social? There's at least gonna be Jimmy's there's at least gonna be chocolate sauce at least

50:28.820 --> 50:31.380
In this building that doesn't provide

50:31.380 --> 50:34.660
In this building in this building that doesn't provide

50:35.620 --> 50:37.060
cool air

50:37.060 --> 50:42.100
They're gonna have Jimmy's like sustaining cool air. That's enough of a problem. Yes

50:42.180 --> 50:43.940
I agree that is an issue Griffin

50:43.940 --> 50:49.540
But if you put social on the flyer and then there are no toppings at the very least Jimmy's

50:50.100 --> 50:54.820
Take them to court. I don't care about the air conditioning thing. You said ice cream social

50:55.460 --> 50:59.220
That means toppings. I mean at least Jimmy's and maybe

50:59.220 --> 51:01.220
At least Jimmy's

51:01.940 --> 51:05.140
I'm not over here asking for hazelnuts and magic shell, you know what I mean?

51:05.140 --> 51:10.180
It doesn't have to be some crushed up oreos. I'm not a nice and Irma's in the in the hot the hot

51:10.740 --> 51:15.940
Topping bathtub. Yeah, there's not gonna be cheesecake cubes or like cookie dough. I get that I get that

51:16.820 --> 51:19.940
But some ready whip some ready whip. Yeah

51:21.780 --> 51:24.020
Jar of maraschino cherries, what's that like three bucks?

51:25.220 --> 51:27.700
Now those come on though. You don't want to clean up after that

51:27.700 --> 51:30.900
Well, you're gonna put down a cloth on the table in the rec room

51:30.900 --> 51:37.060
Well, anytime you're getting a lot of old people together. You want to put down some newspapers Justin Patrick McElroy. That is not his middle name

51:37.060 --> 51:42.020
It's not my middle name. Um, I I think just go for it. They'd be happy to see you there

51:43.060 --> 51:47.700
There's always ice cream left over if they got just enough ice cream for these people once again

51:47.700 --> 51:50.420
Take him to court take this landlord to court

51:50.420 --> 51:55.380
If you say if you walk in there and say hey, um, it's a hot day and i'm gonna work really hard

51:55.380 --> 51:59.080
Can I get into that ice cream? They would be thrilled. You know, i'll be overjoyed

51:59.700 --> 52:03.860
They would be to be able to share. Okay Griffin, you're making a face. No, they would be thrilled

52:04.180 --> 52:08.020
It's just when was the last time you were in a room with exclusively a bunch of

52:08.740 --> 52:12.500
They've got stories Griffin. They got stories. Let me finish

52:13.460 --> 52:20.260
sweaty 55 plus year olds who are now reaping the benefits of the sweat from their brow, which is to say

52:20.260 --> 52:28.500
Briers and jimmies and then you walk in there with your fucking air pods plugged in probably listening to fucking

52:28.740 --> 52:30.580
choppo trap house

52:30.580 --> 52:31.860
and

52:31.860 --> 52:39.940
They look at you with your fucking invaders m t-shirt on and your fucking wallet chain wait and you're fucking

I mean you want to eat?

52:51.460 --> 52:53.220

52:59.220 --> 53:01.220
You want our ice cream?

53:01.540 --> 53:03.540

53:15.140 --> 53:17.860
Sorry, we don't have any uh dairy free

53:17.860 --> 53:22.500
Here you're gonna have to look they probably do though. I mean they probably they must okay

53:22.580 --> 53:27.380
You would think they do you'd need to have at least one dairy-free option one other thing that we're not considering here

53:28.820 --> 53:30.820
Okay, thank you god

53:34.580 --> 53:36.580

54:06.980 --> 54:11.540
Today we're going to be talking about a new taco bell menu innovation

54:12.420 --> 54:13.780
um innovation

54:13.780 --> 54:15.780
No, that's not what he said

54:15.860 --> 54:19.140
Huh? Oh shit. Oh shit. What the

54:20.580 --> 54:22.580
Everything has changed

54:22.820 --> 54:30.200
Everything's different. It's so big. What is so big travis the cheese it justin. Well, that's the big cheese at tostada

54:31.460 --> 54:34.660
Is currently being tested in southern california for what would you pay?

54:34.660 --> 54:37.940
What what wouldn't I pay justin? Well, I hope

54:38.660 --> 54:39.220
I'll tell you what

54:39.220 --> 54:44.900
You won't pay that's two dollars and fifty cents because it is 249 and if you pay a set over that you have been

54:45.540 --> 54:50.820
Ripped off and then did you say this is available at all locations now at all locations in california?

54:50.900 --> 54:55.060
That are that it's being tested in the masterminds of taco bell and cheese

54:55.060 --> 55:00.280
It have come together for the ultimate test kitchen test the big cheese at tostada

55:00.280 --> 55:07.960
Just like the iconic cracker this innovation features a cheese at square, you know and love made with 100 real cheese

55:08.420 --> 55:10.420
ridges, but it's not

55:10.600 --> 55:17.480
Is now 16 times the original size just like you would buy at any restaurant in mexico

55:17.640 --> 55:19.640
That's literally the sentence. It says is

55:20.680 --> 55:27.480
The cheese that you know and love made with 100 real cheese ridges, but is now 16 times the original size

55:27.480 --> 55:33.560
um, the collab were they paying by the word like it was an old-timey telegram

55:33.880 --> 55:35.640
Should we put and ridges? No, no

55:35.640 --> 55:42.120
We can't afford a man's ridges the collab creation tops the oversized cracker with layers upon layers of taco bell flavors

55:42.440 --> 55:46.360
For a limited time in southern california, which I love that. They don't have to specify any more

55:46.440 --> 55:49.400
It's just like, you know, it's got a bunch of taco bell shit on it. Just like you get it

55:49.480 --> 55:51.400
This stuff we put on things

55:51.400 --> 55:53.080
We put the leavings on it

55:53.080 --> 55:56.680
You know how we take we take a hard thing and then we just do some meat jazz in there

55:56.680 --> 56:02.540
Yeah for a limited time in southern california fans can crunch their cravings with this abundantly cheesy and nostalgic

56:02.920 --> 56:06.360
Yet magically modern dining experience get fucked. There are

56:06.920 --> 56:10.280
A few things it's weird that they put get fucked in their press release

56:10.280 --> 56:17.160
There are a few things that everyone can agree on but the iconic flavors from taco bell menu items

56:17.880 --> 56:20.440
And cheese it snacks appeal to all

56:21.160 --> 56:23.160
sure to

56:23.720 --> 56:25.160
All

56:25.160 --> 56:29.800
Yeah, everyone can agree that we love taco bell flavors and cheese it snacks

56:31.080 --> 56:38.200
We're thrilled about this new concept with cheese it which gives our fans the chance to experience the real cheese and crunch

56:38.280 --> 56:41.480
They love from both our brands in a whole new way

56:41.800 --> 56:48.840
Let me just say the real cheese and crunch parentheses for the first 30 seconds and then say goodbye to that crunch

56:49.320 --> 56:52.760
Until they're enjoying the new orange slog bog

56:52.760 --> 56:54.760
Uh

56:54.920 --> 57:00.600
I would love to see side-by-side pictures of this image and and then I opened the box

57:01.560 --> 57:06.220
That that's not all uh, uh a crunchier exclusive surprise

57:07.480 --> 57:10.760
By the way, they describe what it is, but it's a big cheese it with like beef

57:11.720 --> 57:14.360
On it and sour cream and tomatoes and crisp lettuce and cheese

57:14.920 --> 57:20.840
Um, that's not all a crunchier exclusive surprise awaits for users of the taco bell website and mobile app

57:20.840 --> 57:28.040
It's the big cheese it crunch wrap supreme, huh? Okay. Okay now i'm now i'm on board now

57:28.120 --> 57:31.720
I'm in something I can pick up you say like an original counterpart

57:31.720 --> 57:37.080
This version includes seasoned beef nacho cheese sauce lettuce reduced fat sour cream and diced tomatoes

57:37.160 --> 57:43.480
But the typical tostada shell is swapped for the oversized cheese it cracker before being wrapped inside a tortilla

57:43.480 --> 57:45.480
That's grilled to go

57:45.480 --> 57:52.040
This is the first time taco bell has offered a digital exclusive as part of a one restaurant test fans can get this cheesy

57:52.040 --> 57:54.040
goodness in the big cheese it crunch wrap supreme for

57:55.060 --> 58:02.220
429 this partnership is a true testament to cheese. It's continued success and commitment to innovation

58:03.320 --> 58:06.360
Says stephanie miller president away from home kellogg company

58:06.760 --> 58:14.360
We're excited to incorporate cheese it made with 100 real cheese into taco bell favorites and deliver customers of bold

58:14.360 --> 58:17.640
Cheesy twist on the iconic chain's go-to

58:18.440 --> 58:20.520
menu staples, so this is at they

58:21.080 --> 58:28.680
Won all the cheese it but here's the real fucking kicker. This is at one taco bell location at two two

58:29.400 --> 58:31.240
two two

58:31.240 --> 58:33.240
Barranca parkway, irvine california

58:33.860 --> 58:40.600
92606 for two weeks. So please you have to get there and let us know

58:40.600 --> 58:44.520
How this is because it looks amazing now. My question is

58:45.400 --> 58:48.760
Does taco bell have the strength? Do they have the power?

58:49.560 --> 58:53.800
As a the fortitude to just sell me a giant cheese it

58:54.280 --> 58:59.400
Yeah, I just want to eat the big taco mess on it. I don't want the mess. I want to pretend i'm a giant

58:59.800 --> 59:01.800
Yeah, just like a no, you know, hold on

59:02.360 --> 59:06.920
With a giant cheese it you're like a borrower or a borrower

59:06.920 --> 59:11.880
I want to pretend we're a borrower which I think you were about to say or maybe just a tiny mouse in the wall

59:12.200 --> 59:18.120
one of those things but like I have two thoughts one the fact that they sell this un-crunch wrapped is

59:19.960 --> 59:26.360
Bonkers the only thing I want to eat right now is this in this crunch wrap but crunch wrapped because un-crunch wrapped

59:26.920 --> 59:28.520
You're talking about you

59:28.520 --> 59:32.760
the person at the taco bell window hands you into your car, uh a

59:32.760 --> 59:39.740
A temporarily firm square piled high with mess that then like what do you you tell me the geometry

59:40.700 --> 59:44.940
Yeah, you're gonna take one bite and the structural integrity will immediately be compromised

59:45.500 --> 59:50.300
Lap of crap now your lap is the taco if you contain it in a tortilla garbage bag

59:50.460 --> 59:53.820
Which is what the crunch wrap would be that's a different story second thing

59:53.980 --> 59:56.300
Justin made us look at a jpeg of this for a long time

59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.180
And I felt like it was that scene in big fish where the kids go to like the witch and she shows them the moment

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.180
Of their death. That's what I felt

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:12.460
