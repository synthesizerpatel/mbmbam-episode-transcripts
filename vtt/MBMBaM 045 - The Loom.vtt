WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:45.680
Charlie Sheen reference.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.640
You can do better than that. Everybody else is doing it. Something about a warlock.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.320
I would like to change the title of our show, and I've been thinking about this really hard,

00:56.320 --> 01:01.200
to Sheen-tervention. What do we do? What do we do in a Sheen-tervention? Basically,

01:01.200 --> 01:06.160
we just we cry out to Charlie Sheen and tell him how his lifestyle is hurting us personally.

01:06.160 --> 01:10.480
Yeah, I don't care if you destroy yourself with Drugs Charlie. Just stop saying such

01:10.480 --> 01:13.920
cool things that my brother and my brother and me in a device show from the modern era

01:13.920 --> 01:18.800
can't keep up. Do you know my favorite thing about the Charlie Sheen psychobility freakout

01:18.800 --> 01:23.200
that's going on right now? My very favorite thing about it is that he's finally openly talking about

01:23.200 --> 01:28.640
how he wants to make Major League Three, but it's like, dog, they already made Major League Three

01:28.640 --> 01:33.280
and it has Scott Bakala in it, but I guess he doesn't accept Major League Three. That's not

01:33.280 --> 01:41.520
canon. It's not canonical. Like, sorry, Bakala. I worry about how this is affecting that fat little

01:41.520 --> 01:46.560
kid. I'm not a Major League fan, so I'm going to take your word that there's a fat little kid.

01:46.560 --> 01:56.720
By the way, guys, that scene in being John Malkovich is like triply awesome now. How great

01:56.720 --> 02:02.080
is that scene where he's hanging out with Charlie Sheen? Now that movie's even crazier, as if.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.440
You think that's when it flipped.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.440
That's when it flipped. Now it's even like, it's like triple. Hi, we're my brother and my brother

02:07.440 --> 02:11.760
and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your host, Justin McElroy.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.680
I'm another host, Travis McElroy.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.720
And I am yet another host, Griffin McElroy.

02:18.720 --> 02:28.080
So this is our fun drive? Is that our last fun drive show? Is that accurate?

02:28.080 --> 02:30.560
It is our final fun drive show.

02:30.560 --> 02:36.240
Yeah. The fun drive is ended and now it's just a slog to Christmas.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.080
What you can't see is I'm slowly loosening my tie and rolling up my

02:40.080 --> 02:45.120
sleeves and pushing a big broom to sweep up all the fun drive stuff. It's very sad.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.320
No, it goes on for another week.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.040
Why am I cleaning up?

02:49.040 --> 02:52.880
Don't clean up. Leave that streamer up. That took me forever. I have to get a ladder now.

02:52.880 --> 02:58.720
Thank you so much. But more on that later. Right now, let's get right into the advising,

02:58.720 --> 03:04.880
the advice, the learning, the growing. Thank you, by the way, to those who have already given.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.320
It is hugely helpful to us and we love you more than we can, words can say.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.200
And for those about to give, we salute you.

03:15.200 --> 03:21.600
And those who never give, suckle bub. Get out of there, you joke thief.

03:22.240 --> 03:27.920
All right. Great. A friend wants to be my roommate, but I would rather not room with him.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.200
What should I tell him? That's from Wobbly Orbit on Twitter.

03:31.200 --> 03:31.920
Suckle bub.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.800
Wobbly underscore. What, Griff?

03:35.440 --> 03:36.240
Suckle bub.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.000
You tell him to suckle bub?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.640
I need to break that down. What are you saying exactly?

03:40.640 --> 03:45.840
I think this is weirder. Suck... ol... bub.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.960
Suckle bub. Suckle bub.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.720
That's something that our dad used to say.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.800
Not to us, like, in a grimy way, though.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.000
No, God, no.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.960
Like, you didn't finish your homework. Like, what are you saying?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.240
Suckle bub.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.160
People who cut him off in the Kroger's parking lot, he would give him,

04:04.160 --> 04:05.760
break him off a piece of his mind.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.680
Yeah. Also, to be fair, yeah, he'd yell hat wearing geekaboy, which-

04:09.680 --> 04:12.400
He'd call him hat wearing geekaboy, which I don't know.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.240
Well, he was wearing a hat. To be fair, that gentleman was wearing a hat,

04:16.240 --> 04:20.080
and he had sort of a geekaboy aura about him.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.560
He was biting the heads off chickens.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.640
Your friend, they don't sound like a really dope friend,

04:28.640 --> 04:29.840
because you don't want to room with them.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.880
So I would say, like, if you had a stratosphere of friends,

04:32.880 --> 04:36.000
they're in the, not in the upper stratosphere,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.520
I would say they're in the lower, sort of our earthbound stratosphere.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.320
So just tell him straight up, because if you hurt his feelings,

04:42.320 --> 04:45.520
you don't seem to like him that much. Right? I mean, does that make sense?

04:45.520 --> 04:49.280
I'm sitting here, like, racking my mind, trying to come up with a sentence,

04:49.280 --> 04:52.320
especially now that you've waited. Like, he's brought it up,

04:52.320 --> 04:54.080
and you said, let me think about it.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.120
Oh, no. Yeah.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.360
Yeah. Like, you come back and go, listen, I thought about it,

04:57.360 --> 05:01.040
and no, there's nothing worse than that situation you proposed.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.000
Like, I can't come up with something to say that makes that not awkward.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.480
I mull it over in my mouth like a jawbreaker,

05:08.480 --> 05:11.680
and what it comes out with is just sour in the inside.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.800
Oh, God. This is not good.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.320
This tastes like dirty dishes.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.440
I have literally asked everyone I know,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.760
and everyone thinks you would be a terrible roommate.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.040
It's out of my hands now. It's in the hands of the people.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.960
That's it. Tell them you took a vote,

05:24.960 --> 05:28.000
and the vote came out against him, and there's nothing you can do about it.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.080
I took an American Idol-style vote,

05:30.080 --> 05:33.040
and everyone dialed the number that said not to live with you.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.960
I think, I don't know, I think you can explain to him.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.800
I think that there's a really big difference

05:38.800 --> 05:41.040
between being a good friend and a good roommate,

05:42.720 --> 05:44.240
and you can just explain to him,

05:44.240 --> 05:48.080
like, I don't think that we would be compatible roommates.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.600
I don't think we'd get along as roommates,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.840
but we can still be, you know, good friends.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.880
I honestly think that the only way to go is to say,

05:54.880 --> 05:57.040
listen, I really value our friendship,

05:57.040 --> 06:01.040
and I know that sometimes living with someone can affect that friendship,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.400
and I don't want to risk that.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
That's great. That's just what I was going to say.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.520
Like, oh, everybody I know that's roomed with somebody has ended up hating him,

06:07.520 --> 06:09.440
and you're too important to me to that.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.920
Yeah, and make sure you say it in the gayest way possible, too.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.400
Just like, you're so important to me and my life.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.320
Like, you really love him so much.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.200
And then give him a suckle bub, just to put a little boo on it.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.680
A little rivet in that one.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.640
My best friend wants to experiment and try meeting some men.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.360
There's a great gay club up the street from me,

06:29.360 --> 06:30.880
and I want to take him there to help him out.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.040
Two things, I'm straight and I've never been a wingman before.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.080
An orientation isn't really a problem.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.840
Been there a few times with my girlfriend, had a great time.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.320
What I need is some advice on how to be a great wingman.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.640
There are some rules I should know, no matter what the situation,

06:48.640 --> 06:52.000
or does the scenario require something more specific?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.240
That's from trying to help in Jersey.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.680
I think the rules for being a great wingman are universal,

06:59.680 --> 07:01.200
no matter what the situation is.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.120
And they're pretty simple.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.600
Like, in my opinion, the main job of a wingman is to be interesting enough,

07:07.600 --> 07:11.280
but not more interesting than the person you're wingman-ing for.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.000
Like, you are a facilitator of the conversation for that friend.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.480
Have either of you ever wingman-ed, wingman-ed,

07:20.480 --> 07:23.680
and A, ever tried, B, ever been successful?

07:25.840 --> 07:27.920
I was once or twice in college.

07:27.920 --> 07:34.240
I'm not very good at it, because I'm very competitive when it comes to being interesting.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.000
And you're just so awesome that everyone wants you to be.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.760
Well, you know, Griffin, I'm not gonna say no to that.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.600
I think the big...

07:43.600 --> 07:49.680
If this listener's experience turns out anything like the ones that I've been a wingman,

07:49.680 --> 07:53.440
this might conclude with him making out in the bathroom with a fat guy.

07:53.440 --> 07:59.120
And I think you need to prepare yourself sort of mentally and spiritually for that very real,

07:59.680 --> 08:01.040
very frightening possibility.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.440
What am I doing?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.280
This isn't worth it.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.200
What steps did I take to get here?

08:08.160 --> 08:12.320
I have another sort of angle that you need to consider on this.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.760
You're a wingman leading gay men into a trap of a dude that may or may not be gay.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.080
It's like a honey trap.

08:20.080 --> 08:20.960
This is my friend...

08:20.960 --> 08:22.000
Oh, you bet it is.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.520
This is my friend Greg.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.000
He thinks he might like dudes, but he's not sure.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.360
You ready?

08:27.360 --> 08:28.160
Let's discuss.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.440
Ultimately, you're trying to provide evidence for him.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.080
You're basically...

08:32.880 --> 08:35.920
He's got a hypothesis that you're testing.

08:35.920 --> 08:41.920
You're a bailiff in the court of love, and you're trying to swing your friend one way

08:41.920 --> 08:47.600
or the other with as much sweet gay meat as you can procure.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.160
That's your job.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.720
So you're saying he needs to focus on quantity and not quality at this point?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.800
Oh, well, I mean, you can do both.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.760
Yeah, especially if it's a cool gay club.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.000
I bet there's all kinds of fine, fine man meat there.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.240
Oh, it's like a fine man meat buffet.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.240
It's like a golden corral of gay clubs.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.280
It's like a shoney's breakfast of sweet gay dudes.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.880
It's like a slaughterhouse.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.520
Whoa.

09:13.520 --> 09:13.760
Whoa.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.680
Oh, that's a weird dip.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.400
I just went of meat, like of all the meat shanks that are hanging around.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.760
Come on down to the slaughterhouse.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.120
Anything goes.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.880
We'll punch your meat like in Rocky.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.880
Hey, come on down to anything goes.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.000
Slaughterhouse Saturdays.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.440
God damn it.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.680
Why haven't I opened up my own gay bar yet?

09:35.680 --> 09:37.440
Why haven't you opened up all the gay bars?

09:37.440 --> 09:39.040
I would change the name every week.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.640
You know what?

09:40.640 --> 09:43.360
I would love to open a gay club called Some Things Go.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.200
It's the most restrained gay club.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.800
Almost anything goes.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.680
You want to go down to Some Things Go?

09:51.680 --> 09:52.640
Oh, it's not that anymore.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.000
Now it's called the Thirsty Snake.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.000
Make your way down.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.720
Red snake.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.680
Griffey, you got an answer?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.120
I got a few.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.360
Got a handful.

10:04.960 --> 10:05.600
I'm sorry.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.960
That's rhetorical.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.720
I know you probably came prepared.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.200
I did.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.200
I came correct and I came prepared.

10:12.160 --> 10:12.880
How about this one?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.800
This is going to open up an interesting dialogue.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.360
This one was sent in by Atiana Kuriyama.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.160
Thank you, Atiana.

10:18.960 --> 10:23.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Edetweave who asks,

10:25.120 --> 10:28.720
should the Bible be updated with online etiquette?

10:32.080 --> 10:32.800
What?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.440
That's all we get.

10:34.080 --> 10:39.760
Well, we know how often the Bible is updated for things like radio etiquette and TV etiquette

10:39.760 --> 10:41.600
and moving pictures etiquette.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.200
So yes, of course it should.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.240
Okay.

10:44.240 --> 10:44.720
So now we know where Travis stands.

10:44.720 --> 10:48.320
Thou shalt not lol with a man as I lols with a woman.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.040
That's what you're saying, right?

10:51.040 --> 10:51.440
Am I the only one?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.600
Thou shalt not laugh at mean cats.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.800
The three out of the three of us who thinks that it definitely,

10:58.800 --> 11:02.560
definitely should be updated with online etiquette because everything that happens now,

11:03.200 --> 11:06.240
anything that happens that's worth mentioning happens on cyberspace.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.760
And Jesus spake.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.840
Judas, thou shalt betray me.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.760
And Judas spake. WTF?

11:13.200 --> 11:14.400
Let's go with the story.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.960
I will say this.

11:16.960 --> 11:22.640
I think that I would only get behind this if they would make a few verses in there

11:22.640 --> 11:29.600
where if you don't use punctuation, Satan himself would come up and drag you down to hell.

11:29.600 --> 11:29.760
Sure.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.840
He would come and swallow you up whole.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.200
Thou shalt not read bee dogs once a day.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.120
Every day. We can squeeze that into Leviticus

11:39.120 --> 11:43.120
along with all the other sorta, some of the wackier laws.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.880
Zanier.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.400
Some of the zanier.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.680
Bible's already pretty zany.

11:47.680 --> 11:55.040
I bet you could slip in some online etiquette and not have too many people by line.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.800
The thing is we would need to come up,

11:56.800 --> 12:01.840
we would need to come up because obviously the internet wasn't around in the day of Jesus.

12:01.840 --> 12:08.960
So what, what we would have to come up with a sort of archaic terminology for the internet

12:08.960 --> 12:12.560
that, that people could read and sort of translate.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.080
And I mean, Oh, Oh, that by this, they, they foresaw the internet.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.440
This is how this applies.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.720
Do you know what I'm saying?

12:18.720 --> 12:21.360
Like it would have to be like the,

12:23.440 --> 12:24.240
Like what?

12:24.240 --> 12:25.120
Like a loom.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.960
Like the loom.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.000
Oh my God.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.360
If we start calling the internet, the loom, I will be on it way more because that's,

12:33.360 --> 12:34.800
that's a cool metaphor right there.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.800
Just strings of pornography and

12:38.800 --> 12:41.120
connecting anonymous strangers.

12:41.120 --> 12:52.400
So it would say while, whilst thou looms don't do not thou shalt not whilst looming.

12:52.400 --> 12:59.040
Thou shalt not forward emails about Obama destroyed the world's food reserves.

12:59.040 --> 12:59.840
Not exactly.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.640
We're talking specifically.

13:02.640 --> 13:09.520
And Moses presented to his people the 10 commandments and they did respond T L D R.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.320
Can we boil those down to five of them?

13:14.320 --> 13:20.160
Maybe I, I spent, I, I don't, I don't get out much in the meat space.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.960
Most of my time is, is online.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.680
My online presence is strong.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.920
I think that it would be nice to have some, some rules that we could teach to youngsters.

13:29.920 --> 13:35.360
Something with some you know, some celestial might behind it.

13:35.360 --> 13:40.880
Like if you, if you send someone a picture of your Dick online,

13:41.680 --> 13:45.200
then, then there's going to be some retribution, some holy, holy retribution.

13:45.200 --> 13:50.320
Uh, let's, let's, let's reconnoiter here, like an unrequested picture of your Dick.

13:50.320 --> 13:50.720
Right?

13:50.720 --> 13:50.880
Yeah.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.000
Like if they want it, I think you'd be at a blessing.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.560
I would think.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.120
I think that it's time for the Bible to be updated.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.840
So I'm saying, Hey Bible, give me the times.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.200
Maybe, um, what would we call it?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.040
The new Gawker version would be good.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.520
This is the new, what are you reading?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.680
Oh, it's the new Gawker version of the Bible.

14:09.680 --> 14:09.920
Yeah.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.800
It's got a, it's got a scroll bar on the side that everybody really hates.

14:12.800 --> 14:21.840
But, uh, so listen, this week we mentioned it before is, is, uh, is max fun drive.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.920
Uh, well, I think this is like a, it's like a, uh, and it's not a week.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.280
It's a, an event.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.560
It's like a Festravaganza, a two week festival.

14:30.560 --> 14:35.760
Uh, we are trying to get new supporters for the max fun network.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.560
And, and a lot of people wonder, well, what does that mean?

14:38.560 --> 14:42.640
Well, basically it means you make a small donation as much as you could feel comfortable

14:42.640 --> 14:47.680
affording anywhere from, we have donations starting at two all the way up to, uh, $200.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.120
And we have some great, you know, prizes, prizes.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.080
Like, you know, those are good.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.880
I like prizes cause it makes you feel like you've won something.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.520
You've won something.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.360
It makes you feel like you're on Bozo's game show.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.640
At the cheapest levels.

15:00.640 --> 15:05.680
I mean, at every level, even the cheapest, you get, uh, some max fun stickers.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.040
You get a maximum membership card.

15:07.040 --> 15:14.000
Uh, you get, uh, access to bonus shows that we recorded sub podcast.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.080
You have recorded, uh, Jordan, Jesse go recorded one.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.960
And, uh, I believe there's a judge on Hodgman.

15:20.960 --> 15:26.000
There is a bonus episode and there's three videos, the sort of like old timey

15:27.200 --> 15:29.520
videos that we rift over.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.480
Ours is called dating do's and don'ts.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.520
And it contains basically any, any information you would ever need to, um,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.960
secure the affection of, of a significant other.

15:40.960 --> 15:41.920
It's all right there.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.720
It's all right there.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.520
And, um, and then as you go up, you get at $10.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.680
We've got a tote bag for you that you will love.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.000
Make sure you choose the right tote bag.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.840
Um, and those tote bags are provided, uh, by eco bags.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.480
Thank you very much.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.880
You fucking shill get it together.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.320
Travis, this is about tote bags, not about corporations.

16:00.320 --> 16:06.080
And yeah, the ego bag folks are very, very kind, uh, to, to hook those up for us.

16:06.080 --> 16:10.480
Um, as you go up $20, there's a cool one USB drive that has much shows on it.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.480
$35 is, is my personal favorite.

16:14.480 --> 16:18.160
It's the judge on Hodgman, uh, post-apocalyptic justice squad.

16:18.160 --> 16:18.560
Is that right?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.000
Have I, have I memorized that now?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.440
It's ingrained in your mind.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.560
It's ingrained in my mind.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.120
You get a, like a boatload of stuff, uh, all the, the tote bags and all that stuff,

16:27.120 --> 16:34.000
but, uh, like, uh, uh, the Eton am FM radio, uh, that it's like a full like nerd

16:34.000 --> 16:34.880
emergency kit.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.200
Yeah.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.320
It is full on.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.640
It's called a nerd emergency kit, which is boom, shakalaka.

16:41.200 --> 16:45.680
Uh, and, and it goes up from there and, and the money that you give.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.480
And I think maybe we didn't make this super clear for people last week.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.000
The money that you give, uh, goes to the maximum fund network and then

16:52.000 --> 16:56.640
the maximum fund network then in turn pays the people who make the shows.

16:56.640 --> 17:01.200
So when you give to us and when you give the maximum network, you're saying.

17:01.840 --> 17:06.720
I want to support Jordan, Jesse go and judge on Hodgman and, uh, my brother,

17:06.720 --> 17:07.520
my brother, me.

17:07.520 --> 17:12.080
And then that money goes back to us and we use it to, uh, we buy equipment

17:12.080 --> 17:12.720
for the show.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.680
We bought, we, uh, pay for hosting for the show.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.760
Cause we have a lot more people downloading it now.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.160
It would get pretty, uh, tough.

17:20.160 --> 17:20.880
In the future.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.480
Like I know that we've had people that have asked about, you know, live shows

17:24.480 --> 17:26.720
and convention appearances and stuff like that.

17:26.720 --> 17:32.480
That kind of thing is now a possibility because of our joining the max fund

17:32.480 --> 17:32.880
network.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.000
These are things that we're hoping to do in the future with support from

17:36.000 --> 17:36.960
listeners like you.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.520
Right.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.760
They've really helped us to grow and to get the word, the message out to more

17:41.760 --> 17:43.440
people, which I know is what you want.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.560
I know that deep down that's, that's, that's what you, you want everybody to

17:46.560 --> 17:47.120
be.

17:47.120 --> 17:51.120
You don't want anybody to miss out on the, on the experience, the teachings.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.760
I would say that you have had.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.840
So if you can, and if you're comfortable doing it, if you're not and you can't

17:57.840 --> 17:59.200
afford it, I get it.

17:59.200 --> 17:59.600
I do.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.560
I honestly, I mean, we have, and we love you just the same.

18:02.560 --> 18:03.680
We'll never stop loving you.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.400
Um, but, but if you can do something, uh, go to HTTP.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.400
You got to include that.

18:10.400 --> 18:16.560
It's forward slash forward slash www dot maximum fund.org forward slash donate.

18:16.560 --> 18:20.640
And, uh, you can give there and you will feel better about it.

18:20.640 --> 18:27.920
And as if to add, uh, make it more tantalizing, Jesse, our boss has drawn a

18:27.920 --> 18:33.200
boner shaped thermometer quite accidentally, I think, but he did actually like he did

18:33.200 --> 18:35.200
will the thermoboner into existence.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.920
But as you give it just fills up.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.320
So your generosity is just stroking it.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.840
Like I want to see it get full.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.360
Well, you've gotten a ton of, um, of one-time donations and those are awesome.

18:45.360 --> 18:49.600
Uh, but we're, we're, we're shooting for 1200, uh, donors.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.520
And for those, those are the, the monthly totals.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.880
So, uh, yeah.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.720
Anything you can give also monthly donors.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.880
We have, uh, we have challenge donors as well.

18:56.880 --> 19:03.040
So every new monthly donor we get the challenge donors chip in an extra, uh, $5 66 and a half

19:03.040 --> 19:06.000
cents, which is still just such a ridiculous number.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.400
Um, so, so any amount you give us a monthly donor, we get that extra, that extra bonus

19:10.400 --> 19:10.720
too.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.160
So, you know, just think about that.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.480
Cause, cause that the, the monthly donors would keep MaxFund afloat and, and help us

19:16.480 --> 19:20.960
reach that, that's the sweet, sweet tip of the Thermaboner.

19:20.960 --> 19:26.000
Also, you know, people said that I only listen to you guys and I'm not interested in MaxFund,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.280
you know, supporting the whole network.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.000
First off, they've been a huge help to us.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.040
Second off, uh, you should go listen to all the shows.

19:33.040 --> 19:38.880
Third off, when you say that we are your favorite show, when you donate, uh, that, that helps

19:38.880 --> 19:40.000
us out a lot.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.400
Um, that, that first, I mean, for, for nothing else other than Pride at the very least, then

19:46.400 --> 19:48.880
it's because I want to crush everybody else.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.240
I want them to know our names, I guess is what I'm saying.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.720
I want them to be ashamed of their poor ass fans.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.720
I want them to quiver.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.800
I want them to quiver at your riches.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.200
God, my brother and my brother and me, they are rich.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.560
They've got some rich fans.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.040
I'm afraid of them.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.680
They've got some Scrooge McDuck action going on.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.600
Plus, if all of you give and you say that my brother made your favorite show, we can

20:09.600 --> 20:13.280
go back to Jesse and be like, hey man, what's up with that cheddar?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.200
Let's get, see if we can't.

20:15.200 --> 20:20.720
Maybe next time you cut a little bit off for your boys, maybe you use the bigger knife,

20:20.720 --> 20:21.600
if you know what I mean.

20:21.600 --> 20:21.920
Yeah.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.040
Get, slide a little more C-O-I-N our way.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.400
We are trying to drown in Velveeta over here.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.640
Some of us are trying to get so cheesy and we just need a little help.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.800
I would say dangerously cheesy.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.760
Help make some McElroy nachos.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.000
How about some McElroy and cheese, if you don't mind.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.800
Notch bros.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.040
Notch bros.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.000
Notch bros.

20:46.000 --> 20:46.640
Cheesing it up.

20:46.640 --> 20:52.720
So anyway, we've taken enough of your valuable time, but if you can, maximumfund.org first

20:52.720 --> 20:53.280
slash donate.

20:53.280 --> 20:53.600
Thank you.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.760
That is our message to you.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.360
I am having a hard time saving money and spending it wisely, ironically.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.960
I'm 23 years old and already money is a big obstacle in life.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.040
Do you guys have any tips or tricks for a would-be Feruga-lite?

21:13.040 --> 21:16.720
Jake, if you figure it out, please let me know.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.240
Send that memo around, Jake.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.160
Circulate that, that knowledge.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.760
I don't, I don't get it, guys.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.440
What do you mean?

21:25.440 --> 21:29.280
We've gotten this question before and I don't, here's what you do, Jake.

21:30.160 --> 21:36.640
If you're about to spend money on something, just don't do, don't do it.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.640
Go do something else instead.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.080
Here's the problem, and for me personally, and I'm going to assume that Jake is in the

21:42.080 --> 21:48.800
same boat I am, the ebb and flow of money is like the tide where between paychecks,

21:48.800 --> 21:52.960
as soon as I get paid, it's like high tide and I'm so excited that I'm like, yeah,

21:52.960 --> 21:57.120
fuck it, I'm rich and like, I'll go and that's when I buy groceries and then I go,

21:57.120 --> 22:04.400
I pay my bills and then I go out drinking and then by like two days before the next

22:04.400 --> 22:09.280
paycheck, it's low tide and I'm so sad for two days and I can't do anything.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.800
I can't even afford a cup of coffee.

22:10.800 --> 22:16.400
But then it's paycheck time again and I'm so excited that I rush out and spend all my

22:16.400 --> 22:19.440
money and it's just, it's kind of that hills and valleys.

22:19.440 --> 22:23.840
Hey Scraps, hey Scraps, we know why it's fucked up.

22:23.840 --> 22:29.360
I think he's pretty well aware of how it feels to be shitty at this.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.520
Like, I don't think, but here's my advice.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.960
There's a narration on that.

22:33.440 --> 22:39.200
Never stop pretending like you're broke because as soon as you get that high of like

22:39.200 --> 22:41.200
a paycheck, you go and you spend it.

22:41.680 --> 22:45.440
Like, yeah, if you can say that in like your sense memory, like remember what it feels

22:45.440 --> 22:48.160
like, that shitty feeling of like, I can't do anything.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.320
I am so broke right now.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.080
If you can like capture that and hold on to it in a crystal, maybe in like a talisman

22:54.080 --> 22:55.280
that you keep around your neck.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.800
Travis, can you give me an analogy for what a crimson tide would be?

23:02.240 --> 23:06.720
A crimson tide is like when you become an assassin and all your money is from killing

23:06.720 --> 23:07.200
people.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.880
So the blood just rolls into this.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.320
And the blood money.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.320
I thought it would have something to do with when you don't have any money and also a bunch

23:14.320 --> 23:17.760
of poisonous krill somehow washes up in your...

23:18.480 --> 23:19.280
Krill humor.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.040
A little something for everybody this week.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.000
That's what I was gonna say.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.960
Jake, I like, I've started using the internet a lot for this and I think I might've given

23:28.960 --> 23:30.240
this pro tip before, but whatever.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.120
Defer your gratification.

23:33.120 --> 23:33.920
Get in that habit.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.920
You see something in the store that you want to buy, just say to yourself, like, hey, I

23:37.920 --> 23:39.440
bet it's cheaper on Amazon.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.600
And then by the time you get home, you'll forget about it.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.400
Guaranteed.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.920
I know, at least I know I do.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.200
There's too much good stuff to...

23:47.200 --> 23:48.640
Also, it's really tempting.

23:48.640 --> 23:53.600
Like it's, I find it personally hard to pay for the things I know I have to pay for.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.640
And I instead want to buy the things I want to buy.

23:56.640 --> 24:03.120
And so if you get paid and immediately like pay your bills, pay rent, pay your rent, pay

24:03.120 --> 24:07.920
rent, pay, you know, off credit cards, anything like that, like immediately don't wait.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.200
And then whenever money is left over, try to save that or try to use that money for

24:13.200 --> 24:13.840
fun things.

24:13.840 --> 24:17.760
Because if you spend your money on fun things first, you're gonna spend your sweet bill

24:17.760 --> 24:20.720
money and you're not gonna be able to pay for, you know, your car and stuff.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.360
Sell your teeth.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.360
Sell your teeth.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.240
Just sell those teeth.

24:26.240 --> 24:26.880
There it is.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.080
You got beautiful teeth there.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.440
You selling?

24:30.960 --> 24:32.720
Could I talk you out of those teeth for...

24:32.720 --> 24:33.520
I don't know.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.240
Cool hundo?

24:34.800 --> 24:35.520
Nice chompers.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.240
Want some cheddar?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.120
My dearest, my brother, my brother, me.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.480
I found myself in a predicament I've never been in before.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.400
I've fallen in love with someone several magnitudes less intelligent than me.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.000
I'm not going to laugh at this person.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.680
I'm making this pledge to myself.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.520
I'm not going to make cruel jokes at their expense.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.720
I'm telling myself this mantra before I really raise the question.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.200
Here we go.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.520
We've been dating for five months and our relationship is absolutely wonderful.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.400
However, I'm afraid you're using words you probably doesn't know.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.160
Or making references to things not found on The Real Housewives in fellow figure.

25:06.160 --> 25:06.800
Feel dumb.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.360
Fuck you.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.000
Can this relationship actually work out?

25:12.720 --> 25:13.440
Thank you.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.760
Dumbfounded in Indiana.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.040
A follow up question.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.560
Dear my brother, my brother and me.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.640
I've recently started dating a guy who thinks he's much, much smarter than me.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.800
He's a real dullard and an asshole, but...

25:26.480 --> 25:27.600
Oh, shit, man.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.520
Oh, man.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.200
Oh, man.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.840
Listen, of course, by default, this is a problem that we can't help but enter into.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.280
Just because of our station.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.720
I'm just going to dip my toe in there.

25:39.440 --> 25:39.680
Yeah.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.480
I love you so much, you fucking dummy.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.440
Like, how does that work out?

25:45.440 --> 25:46.720
You dullard.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.280
I love you.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.120
Love you, stupid.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.640
Now, are you saying she's dull?

25:50.640 --> 25:51.520
Like, she's dumb?

25:51.520 --> 25:56.080
Like, she often runs into walls and you have to point her towards the door?

25:56.080 --> 25:59.440
Or like, she just doesn't read the big fancy books you read?

25:59.440 --> 26:04.320
He didn't say, he didn't say several IQ points less.

26:04.320 --> 26:07.120
He said several magnitudes less.

26:07.120 --> 26:12.400
The light from his star would take a million years to get to her earth.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.360
I think is what he's saying.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.120
I mean, if she's...

26:19.280 --> 26:20.240
Let's get this out there.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.800
If it's right, and you know what I'm talking about.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.280
If that's right, then a lot of this stuff will work.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.320
What do you, what do you mean?

26:26.320 --> 26:26.880
What's right?

26:26.880 --> 26:30.320
Like, you know, I don't want, I'm a gentleman.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.680
Like that front, like that front meet?

26:33.680 --> 26:36.160
It's that front meet is so right and so dope.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.360
Then a lot of these things will sort of pan out.

26:40.400 --> 26:46.640
Like, it's like, oh, that's a really fascinating story about what Gordon Ramsay's into this week.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.800
I'm going to go ahead and bone you now.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.520
Is that cool?

26:50.720 --> 26:52.000
Can we skip to that?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.840
I'm going to bet that in any relationship, there's always a balance.

26:55.840 --> 27:00.720
And I'm going to bet that there is some way that she is massively better than you.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.520
And it bounds that I'm betting she is supremely more attractive than you.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.200
And you're supremely smarter.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.320
You ugly fuck.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.040
That's the balance right there.

27:09.040 --> 27:09.840
This is fun.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.440
I like this question.

27:11.440 --> 27:17.040
Well, this question got a little mean, but I think, I think that we're just trying to bring you back down to reality.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.120
Listen to this.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.480
We're several magnitudes smarter than you, and we still let you listen to our show.

27:23.040 --> 27:23.520
Exactly.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.720
Think about that.

27:24.720 --> 27:29.920
Because we've been trained in the arts of wisdom for many, many years.

27:29.920 --> 27:38.160
So we know basically everything, despite what Bob Ball, our announcer, would have you believe.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.520
Maybe she's street smart.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.160
Ooh, I like that.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.640
Does she spend a lot of time on the street?

27:45.760 --> 27:49.760
Like you lose your wallet and she says, it ain't no thing.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.600
I'll go shake down Huggy Bear.

27:52.640 --> 27:53.760
See what the word is.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.320
From Starsky and Hutch?

27:57.920 --> 27:59.760
No, but the new Starsky and Hutch.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.200
I'm 30 years old.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.640
What do you want from me?

28:02.640 --> 28:03.680
Yeah, it's for the new one.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.400
That's what I was.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.280
Thank you, Travis.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.400
That's what I'm talking about.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.880
Can you tell me who played Huggy Bear in the new Starsky and Hutch?

28:08.880 --> 28:09.440
Snoop Dogg.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.480
That'd be Snoop Dogg.

28:10.480 --> 28:10.880
Well done.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.360
Well done.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.080
Come on.

28:12.080 --> 28:12.560
Come on.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.640
It's my first time through Rodeo.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.760
Maybe if you hang out with her long enough, she'll learn some shit.

28:18.560 --> 28:18.880
Yeah.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.400
Oh, but dear sweet God, do not approach it.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.160
Like, I'm going to better you.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.080
Oh, God, no.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.000
I know you're lucky to be dating me, stupid.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.640
I think we're planning on going on a date.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.080
How would you feel about a tutoring session instead?

28:34.080 --> 28:37.920
The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plains.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.000
This is fun.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.360
Isn't this better than a movie?

28:41.360 --> 28:42.160
I think it is.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.360
Well, no, sit back down.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.960
We only have a few more hours left, but.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.640
Oh, it looks like you got a 62 on your test.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.280
So no, we can't watch Real Housewives tonight.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.880
Sorry, sweetie.

28:52.880 --> 28:58.400
It's a reward system and I got to adhere to it.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.560
I think the absolute worst thing you can do and just the thing that you should avoid doing,

29:02.560 --> 29:11.840
no matter what, is to write into an internet comedy program telling them how stupid your

29:11.840 --> 29:12.560
girlfriend is.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.280
Because I don't care how dumb she is.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.800
She ain't too dumb to read the internet.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.640
Yahoo Answers proves that out every single week.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.140
Yep.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.800
Griffin.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.360
You want one?

29:23.360 --> 29:25.200
Speaking of which, I got a taste.

29:25.200 --> 29:25.700
I said it.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.680
I got a taste for it in my mouth.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.760
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.720
Thank you, Jacob.

29:30.720 --> 29:36.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jerry Has Lion King.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.120
Congratulations, Jerry.

29:39.120 --> 29:39.840
Good work, Jerry.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.480
Good job, Jerry.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.440
I knew you'd afford it.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.920
Who asks, what would happen if I knock out the pizza guy?

29:45.920 --> 29:49.440
What if I'm running low on cash, but I'm really hungry?

29:49.440 --> 29:52.800
What if three of my friends are at my house and we ordered pizza?

29:52.800 --> 29:55.440
We have no cash and we called the pizza guy.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.480
I'm wondering what would happen.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.840
This is, for all intents and purposes, the perfect crime.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.880
Can we agree on that?

30:07.680 --> 30:10.320
I don't think there's any way this goes wrong.

30:10.320 --> 30:14.000
How is the pizza guy supposed to track him down with just his name, telephone number,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.800
and address?

30:16.800 --> 30:21.680
Also, the pizza guy's going to wake up from the ground and be like, what just happened?

30:21.680 --> 30:23.600
This mystery's never going to get solved.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.800
He also knows your pizza preferences, too.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.320
So the top of the jugs.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.760
Can you describe him?

30:29.760 --> 30:32.880
No, but I can tell you what kind of toppings he asked for on his pizza.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.040
Can you describe the man who assaulted you?

30:35.840 --> 30:38.880
Well, this is his name and his phone number and his address.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.880
And also, he likes pineapples on his pizza.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.800
And he asked me to draw a wizard on the bottom.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.400
He asked me to draw a wizard on the box.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.240
He's a Chovies and Pep man.

30:46.240 --> 30:53.040
So you could just look for people ordering Chovies and Pep on their pizza and just arrest

30:53.040 --> 30:54.240
them.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.760
I want to know what kind of beefcake pizza guy you've got that you need three of your

30:57.760 --> 30:59.440
friends to take care of.

30:59.440 --> 30:59.680
Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.720
Waiting in the bushes, one on top of the roof.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.000
He'll never see it coming.

31:05.120 --> 31:10.960
See, what's disturbing is that if you ordered this pizza online, you could track it.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.960
You could track who is delivering your pizza.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.920
You could get a name.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.080
That makes it more personal.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.960
Shouldn't have brought that pizza, Derek.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.280
Punch.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.280
We're waiting for you, Derek.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.760
Hope you get here quick.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.520
Is there any other...

31:26.160 --> 31:30.320
I've always wondered if you ordered a pizza from a dude and he looks a little dogged.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.440
He looks a little tired.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.360
What if you just invited him in?

31:33.360 --> 31:34.880
It's like, hey, I'm not going to pay for this pizza.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.040
But do you want to chill with us and eat this pizza with us?

31:37.600 --> 31:38.720
Do you want to zomp with us?

31:38.720 --> 31:43.440
And then when he's really full, you kill him and make a pizza out of him.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.440
And then you eat that pizza.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.720
Then it's the perfect crime.

31:46.720 --> 31:47.120
Double pizza.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.280
You guys want to hear a true delivery story?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.160
Double pizza.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.440
I don't know, Travis.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.000
You tell me.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.080
I worked for a...

31:55.040 --> 31:59.280
I don't want to give the name, so what to say, a popular sandwich delivery restaurant

32:00.320 --> 32:03.840
who may or may not be known for being freaky fast.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.200
Let's call it Johnny Jacks.

32:05.920 --> 32:06.800
Johnny Jacks.

32:06.800 --> 32:13.200
I worked for Johnny Jacks and it was around the corner from my friend Trevor David's house.

32:13.200 --> 32:17.840
And Trevor David would call during parties and order sandwiches so I could deliver a

32:17.840 --> 32:22.400
sandwich and take a shot and then go back to work because I was not able to attend the party.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.440
Good for you.

32:23.440 --> 32:28.720
And so I would often deliver, I don't know, six or seven sandwiches a night back to that house.

32:29.360 --> 32:29.860
Travis.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.080
Living the life you want.

32:32.080 --> 32:36.480
Getting blitzed to Jimmy Jacks.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.720
Johnny Jacks, please.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.080
Your older brother, Travis Griffin.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.600
There's your role model.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.600
You just, by saying that on the internet, you've been blackballed.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.160
You can never work at another Johnny Jacks ever again.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.000
You can never go back home.

32:52.960 --> 32:53.520
Time out.

32:54.560 --> 33:01.600
Travis, are you telling me that you're becoming a progressively drunker driver as the night went on?

33:01.600 --> 33:02.320
No, no, no.

33:02.320 --> 33:05.120
It was literally down the alley from the Johnny Jacks.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.360
I would walk the sandwich there and walk back.

33:07.360 --> 33:12.240
But that drunkenness, I don't know if you know how drunk works, it stays with you for a while.

33:12.240 --> 33:18.560
So if somebody did call in an order, you'd be like, guys, I want to get your sloppy mess to you.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.960
But I'm fucked.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.440
I messed up.

33:23.440 --> 33:30.720
Hey, Jimmy Jacks, can I get a, let me just get a salami grand slam.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.920
Um, dog, can you, what is on it?

33:35.520 --> 33:37.280
Dog, please come here and make it.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.160
I'm so fucked up.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.360
Where's the bread?

33:39.360 --> 33:40.320
Where do we keep it?

33:41.760 --> 33:44.400
That does make ordering a sandwich a lot more exciting, though.

33:45.840 --> 33:46.560
So there we go.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.640
I hope that helps out.

33:48.640 --> 33:55.040
My wife just realized that my favorite hat has the phone number of an ex-girlfriend inside the brim.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.080
She did not buy it.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.480
I did not have paper when I met her.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.480
She did not buy it.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.160
I did not have paper when I met her.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.360
Should I throw the hat away?

34:06.480 --> 34:11.360
Hey, Gmail, I don't know you very well, but I'm going to play law of averages and say that if

34:11.360 --> 34:19.040
you're a man between, well, let's say 18 and 35, you should throw the hat away.

34:19.040 --> 34:19.440
Yeah.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.280
You should probably not wear it.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.720
What was the, what was the thought process there?

34:24.720 --> 34:30.240
I want to know the steps that got you from point A to point I'm going to write on my hat.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.200
If decapitated, please call.

34:34.080 --> 34:38.160
It just seems to me like there's so many, there's so many options.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.120
Oh, I know.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.520
There's your hand first and foremost.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.120
I'd rather have it written on my face cause I can wash my face.

34:45.120 --> 34:45.680
Yeah.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.760
Did the ex-girlfriend write it on the inside brim?

34:47.760 --> 34:51.760
Cause if so, that would be kind of a baller way of like, I'm in you.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.920
Like you'll never forget this number.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.800
Wait, when you say in like a bottom of the brim, are you talking about like

34:58.800 --> 35:01.840
the flat bill of the hat you've written it or like inside the hat?

35:02.400 --> 35:06.480
Ooh, that's a good point because if it's on the brim and you go to a NASCAR event

35:06.480 --> 35:10.480
and you get sweaty, then that number is going to be on you backwards.

35:11.200 --> 35:11.680
Backwards?

35:12.320 --> 35:17.040
Hey listener, how bad are you at wives that you couldn't lie better than this?

35:18.160 --> 35:20.320
Oh, this is the number at the hat company.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.360
It's a hat store.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.440
This is the customer service number.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.400
It's the hat store.

35:24.400 --> 35:24.720
Please.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.720
We're trying to post for a family photo.

35:26.720 --> 35:26.960
Please.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.880
Hey lids, we need to have a talk about your hat.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.320
I'm having some problems with it.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.120
I think it's low on coolant.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.960
Your hat is malfunctioning.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.960
I'm having a malfunctioning hat problem.

35:38.960 --> 35:44.560
And luckily I wrote the number of your, of your emporium, of your haberdashery

35:46.320 --> 35:49.920
in, in just in case I needed to contact you about a defective product.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.480
You don't tell her it's your girlfriend, listener.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.480
You should throw the hat away as punishment.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.520
That's your penance for being so stupid.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.920
You own a hat with, that someone has written on.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.840
Why haven't you already thrown it away?

36:01.840 --> 36:04.720
Listen, we can lead, we can lead you guys to walk away.

36:04.720 --> 36:07.040
You guys to water, but you got to lie to your wives for yourself.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.800
We can only do so much for you.

36:12.320 --> 36:16.160
I'm a native Texan who recently relocated to Melbourne, Australia for love.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.560
And I'm at a linguistic crossroads.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.320
People down here say mate all the time, like in the movies.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.520
And I can't make myself do it.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.000
I knew it.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.640
I say man in the same way.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.160
Like, Hey, thanks, man.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.440
And then really fly down under.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.920
Should I assimilate or should I shake them haters off?

36:33.920 --> 36:37.680
Linguistic blunder down under a name created by Travis.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.400
Um, right.

36:40.400 --> 36:47.200
So my experience with this is that if you live in another country for any sort of extended

36:47.200 --> 36:51.840
period of time, you know, like Madonna, you will eventually start to pick up some of their,

36:51.840 --> 36:54.720
um, what idiosyncrasies.

36:54.720 --> 36:58.000
What's the, what's the, what's the length of time?

36:58.720 --> 37:00.160
What is the appropriate length of time?

37:00.160 --> 37:05.760
Because I had friends in school who would go to a foreign country, come back two weeks

37:05.760 --> 37:09.440
later and had completely reinvented themselves.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.880
Just a completely different person.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.320
Travel changes you, Griffin.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.200
You know what?

37:13.200 --> 37:13.680
You know what?

37:13.680 --> 37:16.240
I'm almost certain that is only a problem in America.

37:16.240 --> 37:16.800
Oh, absolutely.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.320
I'd be willing to bet that English people don't come to America for two weeks and come

37:20.320 --> 37:20.880
back on.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.840
Well, how do y'all like, I promise that.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.600
Oh, I bet they probably do.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.720
It's America.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.480
Like I would want everybody to know.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.840
What's the length of time though?

37:29.840 --> 37:32.880
I'm going to say anything less than two years.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.000
And you're just being a dick.

37:34.720 --> 37:41.040
Well, I think that once you pass a certain age, like if you're older than 22, you shouldn't

37:41.040 --> 37:43.680
like you, you have formed your accent.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.720
Shouldn't change.

37:44.720 --> 37:48.800
I lived in a third world country with Sydney for a month and I did come back really hungry.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.920
I don't know if that counts.

37:51.520 --> 37:58.000
Um, and all your t-shirts were like a rat from 1985.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
I think that I think that you should soak it up.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.760
I think you should say mate because I think everybody wants to say mate.

38:05.760 --> 38:11.920
But, um, just if, if I hear anyone say mate that is not from Australia or the British

38:11.920 --> 38:16.880
Isles, um, I get the strongest douche chills that I just want to fall to the ground and

38:16.880 --> 38:17.920
shake uncontrollably.

38:17.920 --> 38:23.200
Well, my friend Miranda is from Australia and she says like, good day mate and stuff

38:23.200 --> 38:23.520
like that.

38:23.520 --> 38:28.160
And it makes me, I still roll my eyes at it cause it's like, come on, you're in America.

38:28.160 --> 38:32.160
You know, I think that you can import that language.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.360
I think you can export it if you've been there long enough, but I just think it has

38:35.360 --> 38:36.000
to be authentic.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.920
And it sounds like you have the opportunity to, to make it authentic.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.880
Well, let me tell you something.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.560
I'll give you the same advice that I gave Miranda.

38:42.560 --> 38:47.920
I told Miranda the beauty that you get from being from a foreign country, now an expat

38:47.920 --> 38:53.440
living in another country, you can make up words and pretend like it's really common

38:53.440 --> 38:58.400
phrases in America and be like, Oh yeah, we're just going to go flibble the doable.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.200
And when they're like, what?

38:59.200 --> 39:00.080
I'm like, Oh, sorry.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.360
You guys don't have that here.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.000
You know what I mean?

39:02.000 --> 39:07.200
And like, those are little things that you can do to make yourself happy and make everyone

39:07.200 --> 39:08.240
else think you're an asshole.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.640
So many of my suggestions end up that way.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.280
Don't Travis basically runs an asshole charm school.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.720
It's going to go one way or the other.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.680
Have you guys noticed how many listeners we have in Australia?

39:21.680 --> 39:22.640
Yeah.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.600
There's a lot, right?

39:23.600 --> 39:25.600
And they're all super attractive.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.960
They all, they all have a crocodile Dundee set.

39:30.080 --> 39:30.400
Yeah.

39:30.400 --> 39:34.400
And there's, they're very tolerant of being compared to Paul Hogan.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.440
Well, they surprise you over all these years.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.800
I, you have to have thick skin.

39:39.520 --> 39:45.040
Uh, I, I'm coming to realize like a crocodile, I'm coming to realize that I'm maybe more

39:45.040 --> 39:49.440
into live music than any of my friends or at least the only one into it enough to pay

39:49.440 --> 39:53.600
a non-refundable $250 on a drunken whim to go to Bonnaroo this year.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.360
I know at least Griffin is into music festivals, but if any of you had advice on a first time

39:57.360 --> 40:00.480
attendee with seems like no backup, I'd really appreciate it.

40:00.480 --> 40:04.560
Alternatively, what is the best way to guilt convince my friends into going with me?

40:04.560 --> 40:04.960
Will G.

40:06.080 --> 40:06.720
Griffin.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.280
Hoo boy.

40:07.920 --> 40:08.960
Help this man.

40:08.960 --> 40:13.440
I haven't gone to Bonnaroo for two years, I think.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.080
Last time I went was yeah, 2009.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.840
I don't, this is not important.

40:17.840 --> 40:23.760
Um, what you need to realize is that you're not just spending $250.

40:25.360 --> 40:33.600
You're spending a week without shower, which if I were to apply a sort of a monetary sum

40:33.600 --> 40:38.800
to that, I would say that that, like the grief that you suffer is worth at least $600, like

40:38.800 --> 40:40.160
600 additional dollars.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.640
Does that include like the shame of bathing in a fountain?

40:44.640 --> 40:46.720
They don't even let you do that anymore.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.000
Oh, Jesus.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.880
There is a fountain, but you can't bring soap or shampoo into it.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.400
Um, it's, it's, it's a, it's an endurance sport.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.360
Depending on which one you go to, like there, there are some music festivals that are, for

40:57.360 --> 41:01.360
instance, there's Pitchfork and here in Chicago and Lollapalooza here in Chicago, where I

41:01.360 --> 41:03.600
can just go to those and then come home and sleep in my bed.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.320
Like those are awesome.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.280
And everyone should definitely go.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.320
You should go to Bonnaroo too.

41:06.320 --> 41:11.440
You just need to go ahead and realize that it's, there's toils.

41:12.080 --> 41:16.400
It's rough stuff because it's 110, 110 degrees all the time.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.680
And there's nothing you can do.

41:17.680 --> 41:21.600
Like there's nowhere you can go to, to seek respite from that.

41:21.600 --> 41:26.560
And what I remember from Griffin telling me is that to get in and get out, like plan on

41:26.560 --> 41:30.960
a solid like half day of being in traffic and then last time campsite.

41:30.960 --> 41:34.800
Last time I went and it took me 10 hours, uh, waiting in line to, to get in.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.760
It was, it was a nightmare.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.400
I only have one Bonnaroo pro tip to share with you.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.280
What's up?

41:41.280 --> 41:42.720
This is a frequent attendee.

41:42.720 --> 41:47.600
Uh, don't be the guy who gets hit by the bus every year.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.680
There's a guy and he's like, I don't know if he's hanging out.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.720
He's hanging out.

41:52.720 --> 41:58.000
He drops some, some opium and he's wondering who the, through the sound garden and then

41:58.000 --> 41:59.120
what happens.

41:59.120 --> 42:03.520
And then through the band sound garden, he hangs out with the band sound garden.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.160
And then he, as they're leaving, he's waving goodbye.

42:06.160 --> 42:06.640
Goodbye.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.840
Sound garden.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.200
Thank you for hanging out with me.

42:09.200 --> 42:09.520
Oops.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.360
I dropped my opium bus.

42:11.360 --> 42:17.280
Like that once a year, there's a guy who gets hit by a bus and you just can't just don't

42:17.280 --> 42:18.560
be that guy.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.600
Don't be bus guy.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.000
And if you hear about a guy getting hit by a bus, whoa, fucking chill out.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.760
Like do whatever you're invincible.

42:25.760 --> 42:29.120
Every year, every year a man does get hit by a bus.

42:29.120 --> 42:33.680
And every year, shortly after that news hit that AP news wire, I would get a call from

42:33.680 --> 42:36.080
my dad just to make sure it wasn't me.

42:36.080 --> 42:36.640
Thanks dad.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.160
And you're like, Hey, you, Hey, stop going.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.960
Griffin stopped going to Bonnaroo cause he knew his number was up.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.200
Were you the one who jumped in front of that bus, you big dummy?

42:45.200 --> 42:48.080
Like, no dad, I have, I got sense in my head.

42:48.080 --> 42:52.240
First of all, to get Bonnaroo takes place on a giant campground to get to a place where

42:52.240 --> 42:52.960
buses are.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.320
That's a journey.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.360
That's a walk.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.320
Like that's, that's a good couple of miles.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.160
Oh, Bonnaroo, come for the music.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.760
Stay to see the herd fin.

43:01.760 --> 43:07.840
If you're floating on ope, if you're floating on ope, if ope floats, which is what I refer

43:07.840 --> 43:12.720
to taking opium, you're not going to have the mental faculties required to find road.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.280
Don't be dumb.

43:15.920 --> 43:16.800
Don't be dumb.

43:16.800 --> 43:22.480
Hey, listen, we wanted to say one last time before we go into the final stretch of the

43:22.480 --> 43:22.720
show.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.440
One last thing though.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.400
What?

43:24.400 --> 43:26.160
I did get prostatitis at Bonnaroo.

43:26.880 --> 43:27.520
Okay.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.160
Real talk.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.240
Just watch your prostate cause it's going to try and do some shitty shit.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.440
It's going to try and catch it.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.880
It's going to come at you from all sides.

43:34.880 --> 43:41.600
Um, so that's, that was worth, I would say $25,000 just hidden costs, hidden costs.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.480
Keep them in mind.

43:42.480 --> 43:42.800
Okay.

43:42.800 --> 43:47.680
Hidden costs, uh, before we, before we head into the final rush, I did want to say thank

43:47.680 --> 43:52.480
you so much to the people who've already supported us this week, uh, during the Maximum Fund

43:52.480 --> 43:57.040
Pledge Drive, uh, we're, we're, our goal is 1200 new donors.

43:57.040 --> 44:03.840
We have crossed 400 last night, so we're, we're on pace, uh, but we need you specifically

44:03.840 --> 44:10.000
you, yes, you, uh, sitting at home, listening to this, driving, not driving, wait till you're

44:10.000 --> 44:10.320
where you're going.

44:10.320 --> 44:17.120
But, uh, I just want to say thank you to people like Dan Stapleton who gave, uh, our boss

44:17.120 --> 44:24.640
and dear friend Chris Grant gave, um, LMM not only gave, but convinced his dad who's

44:24.640 --> 44:28.160
only listened to one episode to give kind of a big coup.

44:28.160 --> 44:32.880
I would like to say a special thanks because he, he tried to come up with a question and

44:32.880 --> 44:33.360
he couldn't.

44:33.360 --> 44:38.880
So he asked that we say this because he donated and I'm willing to give this to him.

44:38.880 --> 44:42.000
Hey, Scott and Pocatello, you're doing all right.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.120
Your kids love you.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.840
And there's a lady out there who's itching to get down with you.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.960
All right, Scott, chin up, buddy.

44:48.960 --> 44:54.400
And in case you think he's not an OG over on the, the Maximum Fund Pledge Drive, we

44:54.400 --> 44:57.440
have a D Hurry.

44:58.080 --> 45:02.560
Yes, we are just 정말 the only people at vraiment how we can get our people to get

45:02.560 --> 45:03.360
involved.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.360
I'll ask reaping to get on there.

45:05.200 --> 45:22.020
Literally, there's a whole bunch of federal

45:22.020 --> 45:24.320
companies in our country that have access to information.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.820
on Twitter.

45:25.820 --> 45:26.660
Did you?

45:26.660 --> 45:29.780
I did, and I promised spooning.

45:30.660 --> 45:31.980
Oh shit, I'll spoon somebody.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.960
Five minutes of spooning, your choice.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.280
You wanna be big spoon, you wanna be little spoon?

45:37.280 --> 45:39.240
Do you wanna be middle spoon?

45:39.240 --> 45:40.080
Do you wanna be two average size?

45:40.080 --> 45:41.520
If you ever find the three of us together,

45:41.520 --> 45:43.240
we can do a four-way spoon.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.080
Oh my God.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.120
No, we can't actually.

45:45.120 --> 45:45.960
We cannot do that.

45:45.960 --> 45:49.940
We will make a full-on silverware drawer on you.

45:49.940 --> 45:52.520
We cannot do that thing that you just said,

45:52.520 --> 45:54.760
but other things, not that one, though.

45:54.760 --> 45:58.760
Teaspoon, tablespoon, soup spoon, secret spoon.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.400
That's us.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.640
Is it?

46:01.640 --> 46:02.480
Yeah.

46:02.480 --> 46:03.760
I don't know that that is us.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.160
Don't you ever tell, though.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.120
Listen, also we wanna say Sunday,

46:10.120 --> 46:14.120
which we won't get to talk to you again before then.

46:14.120 --> 46:18.960
Sunday at nine to seven p.m. Pacific, so it's obviously-

46:18.960 --> 46:20.560
Wanna try that again?

46:20.560 --> 46:21.800
Seven to nine p.m.?

46:21.800 --> 46:22.760
What did I say?

46:22.760 --> 46:24.280
You said nine to seven.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.200
Okay, yeah, it's a fuckin' all-night gym arena.

46:27.200 --> 46:30.640
No, seven to nine p.m.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.520
Of course, that's 10 to 11 on a, fuck it.

46:33.520 --> 46:34.720
God, it's summer.

46:34.720 --> 46:35.800
Jesus, Justin.

46:35.800 --> 46:36.760
Bitch.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.520
All right, Sunday, March 13th,

46:39.520 --> 46:41.640
from seven to nine p.m. Pacific,

46:41.640 --> 46:44.680
which is nine to 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.320
Not even close dog.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.440
Fuck!

46:48.440 --> 46:50.600
Still ain't got it dog.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.480
10 to midnight, Eastern Standard Time.

46:52.480 --> 46:53.920
Jesus, please us.

46:53.920 --> 46:54.960
Jesus Christ.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.040
That's gonna be the Max Fun Drive finale.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.000
It's where it all comes to a head,

46:59.000 --> 47:02.160
and there's gonna be a Jordan and Jesse go live video stream,

47:02.160 --> 47:04.440
and they're gonna be givin' away a bunch of crap there, too,

47:04.440 --> 47:08.280
in addition to asking people for last-minute donations,

47:08.280 --> 47:09.800
like that scene in UHF.

47:10.720 --> 47:15.680
There's gonna be an Xbox 360 being given away,

47:15.680 --> 47:17.640
some games, cool stuff like that,

47:17.640 --> 47:19.240
so make sure you tune into that,

47:19.240 --> 47:20.960
and then just go to maximumfun.org.

47:20.960 --> 47:24.600
Also, I wanna, just quick thanks to everybody on Twitter

47:24.600 --> 47:26.960
that has donated and made a point of saying,

47:26.960 --> 47:28.520
hey, I donated, and you should, too.

47:28.520 --> 47:31.480
We really appreciate everybody challenging their friends

47:31.480 --> 47:34.200
and followers, and everybody who's just brought

47:34.200 --> 47:36.480
any kind of attention to the Max Fun Drive.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.360
We really appreciate it, and I'll try to keep up

47:38.360 --> 47:40.560
with retweeting those and giving you guys

47:40.560 --> 47:42.680
as much attention as I can.

47:42.680 --> 47:43.520
Thanks, everybody.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.920
Yeah, if you donate, don't be shy.

47:45.920 --> 47:47.080
Go ahead and shout it out,

47:47.080 --> 47:47.920
and talk about how you donate.

47:47.920 --> 47:51.000
Everybody else feel bad, and if your people don't give,

47:51.000 --> 47:51.840
shun them.

47:51.840 --> 47:52.660
Just shun them.

47:52.660 --> 47:53.500
Turn your back on them.

47:53.500 --> 47:54.400
Shun them.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.720
I don't know if our dad's given, and he's shunned,

47:56.720 --> 47:58.400
and he's in the bonus episode.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.920
Oh, we can tell you, the bonus episode has our dad,

48:00.920 --> 48:03.200
has John Hodgman, has Jordan and Jesse,

48:03.200 --> 48:04.640
has Brent.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.000
Has my friend Brent O'Floss from the show.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.360
From his show.

48:09.440 --> 48:12.280
And Dave and Graham from Stop Podcasting Yourself.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.120
Dave and Graham.

48:13.120 --> 48:15.400
Oh my god, it's jam-packed.

48:15.400 --> 48:18.880
So, again, MaximumFun.org forward slash donate,

48:18.880 --> 48:19.720
if you can.

48:19.720 --> 48:21.080
We really, really do appreciate.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.640
You guys made, seriously, a great, great showing

48:24.640 --> 48:29.440
from NBNB AM, but we want them to know how we do.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.040
We want them to know.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.680
We're trying to bring the thunder.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.980
Some of us are trying to bring the thunder over here.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.200
But anyway, thank you so much.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.040
I have a question that I've been looking forward

48:39.040 --> 48:42.520
to asking you guys for a while now,

48:42.520 --> 48:45.520
but I've managed to restrain myself.

48:45.520 --> 48:48.400
Serious problemo in England.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.240
That's not.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.400
What?

48:51.400 --> 48:52.240
Problemo?

48:52.240 --> 48:53.480
That's not English speak.

48:53.480 --> 48:55.480
That's what they say.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.800
Serious problemo in England.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.400
I recently impregnated my wife for the third time,

48:59.400 --> 49:03.640
and she is now insisting that I close down my baby factory

49:03.640 --> 49:06.920
by having the man snip, but I'm not sure I fancy that.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.960
What are your thoughts?

49:07.960 --> 49:09.700
And please help me.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.780
Dave in England.

49:11.780 --> 49:13.680
Dave, I'm almost certain that by man snip,

49:13.680 --> 49:16.960
you mean cutting off your penis, and I can't get behind that.

49:16.960 --> 49:21.960
No, he means a doctor with a degree taking a scalpel,

49:22.120 --> 49:25.480
cutting his wiener open, and hurting it,

49:25.480 --> 49:26.480
and hurting it in a.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.320
No!

49:27.320 --> 49:28.700
Yes, that's what he means.

49:28.700 --> 49:29.540
Like, that's the.

49:29.540 --> 49:30.380
No!

49:30.380 --> 49:31.200
Yeah, that's the gag.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.040
That's what he's saying.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.200
Hey, Dave, listen, straight up.

49:33.200 --> 49:35.500
All your life, from birth till now,

49:35.500 --> 49:38.000
you have had one true friend who's always been with you,

49:38.000 --> 49:39.320
and it's your wiener.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.920
Your wiener's there for you when your wife has not been.

49:41.920 --> 49:45.640
24-7, your wiener has been there to support you

49:45.640 --> 49:48.080
as much as he can, and this is what you're gonna do to him?

49:48.080 --> 49:53.000
I have to interject here and say that those few weeks

49:53.000 --> 49:54.640
when I got back from Bonnaroo,

49:54.640 --> 49:57.400
my wiener and I were not on speaking terms.

49:57.400 --> 50:00.600
Well, sometimes you and your friends quibble.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.680
Sometimes you got beef with your friends.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.680
Sometimes Griffin's friend dribbles.

50:04.680 --> 50:07.960
There was some bad blood there.

50:07.960 --> 50:08.920
Literally.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.040
Literally.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.400
What is a vasectomy?

50:11.400 --> 50:12.240
How does that work?

50:12.240 --> 50:13.320
I've never understood a vasectomy.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.880
Is it just like, you don't jizz anymore?

50:14.880 --> 50:15.960
Like, what happens?

50:15.960 --> 50:20.400
No, your vas deferens transports, basically,

50:20.400 --> 50:25.400
the sperm into your semen is snipped and sewn off, yeah.

50:25.800 --> 50:29.680
So you're still shooting blanks, basically.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.560
So you got the powder, but you don't have the lead.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.000
The surgery works like this.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.240
They cut your wiener open,

50:35.240 --> 50:37.600
and if you're lucky, you die on the table.

50:37.600 --> 50:40.800
You know what I think is even freakier?

50:40.800 --> 50:43.520
It's like an outpatient procedure.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.280
Like, you're in, you're out, half hour.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.560
You haven't even finished your copy of Highlights

50:47.560 --> 50:50.040
before you're back out in the world with a cut-up penis.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.600
You're reading Goofus and Gallant

50:51.600 --> 50:53.440
while they're flaying your dick.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.560
Like, while they're flaying your...

50:55.560 --> 50:58.200
And P.S., if that's happening to you, you're a Goofus.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.320
You won't find that in the magazine,

51:02.320 --> 51:05.360
but I've been reading for a while, you're a Goofus.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.760
Trust me on this.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.680
Gallant doesn't let his dick get eviscerated

51:09.680 --> 51:12.200
like a fried hot dog.

51:12.200 --> 51:14.520
Goofus, however, cannot say the same.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.600
Gallant learns to wrap it up

51:16.600 --> 51:19.360
before his wife wants his wiener cut off.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.960
Hey, Gallant, hey, Goofus, maybe try, like, a condom?

51:22.960 --> 51:24.520
If you, I mean, I don't know.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.840
It's a one-two punch.

51:26.840 --> 51:30.760
Dave, there are so many solutions

51:30.760 --> 51:33.080
for you to pursue before this one.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.880
How about the old Princeton pullout?

51:34.880 --> 51:36.040
What's that?

51:36.040 --> 51:38.840
The old classy, classy pullout.

51:39.880 --> 51:42.680
It's where you pull out while waving a banner for Princeton.

51:42.680 --> 51:43.520
Shit.

51:44.800 --> 51:47.720
You're wearing knee-high socks at the time.

51:47.720 --> 51:49.480
Cursed local Harvard men.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.720
In your fur jacket.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.280
Make sure you have a tiny pennant.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.000
You dress like John,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.320
fat John Farro from Rudy.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.920
Dave, don't do this thing.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.840
This thing that you're saying, don't do it.

52:04.840 --> 52:07.200
It's just so scary.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.240
It's just horrifying.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.160
Like, I will say, though,

52:11.160 --> 52:13.840
as somebody who has been married for years,

52:13.840 --> 52:15.840
if you do this thing,

52:15.840 --> 52:17.840
this thing that she is saying to you,

52:19.120 --> 52:20.480
you've won.

52:20.480 --> 52:21.320
Yep.

52:21.320 --> 52:24.960
You've won the relationship forever.

52:24.960 --> 52:25.800
Yeah, there's not a-

52:25.800 --> 52:27.320
That is a pretty big trump card.

52:27.320 --> 52:31.080
That would, that wraps up every single,

52:31.080 --> 52:36.080
hey, you didn't leave the toilet seat down for me.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.440
Yeah, I started looking at my dick scar

52:38.440 --> 52:39.920
and thinking about how I'm half a man.

52:39.920 --> 52:42.240
So maybe you'll just put it down yourself.

52:42.240 --> 52:45.400
Do you want to rent the expendables or eat pray love?

52:45.400 --> 52:46.240
I don't know.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.760
Let me consult with my ruined member.

52:48.760 --> 52:52.520
See, and let's just see what he,

52:52.520 --> 52:55.040
oh, this just in, expendables.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.680
It's just, the more you talk about it,

52:56.680 --> 52:59.160
the more I'm just getting sad for Dave Zawina.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.360
Yeah. Poor Dave Zawina.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.800
That's- He has no input in this.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.800
Dave, don't do it.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.160
Dave, don't do it. Dave, don't do it.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.000
Do it.

53:06.960 --> 53:07.960
Griffin says do it.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.760
I don't know why Griffin said that, but-

53:09.760 --> 53:11.120
I hear that it makes it,

53:11.120 --> 53:13.560
it makes sex feel better after it.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.240
Oh, like downtown?

53:15.240 --> 53:16.080
Like down there. Yeah,

53:16.080 --> 53:17.920
cause nothing like numbing surgery

53:17.920 --> 53:19.600
to make something more pleasurable.

53:19.600 --> 53:20.440
Mm-hmm.

53:20.440 --> 53:21.280
Ugh.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.120
That only lasts for so long.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.380
Scar tissue.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.320
So I want to hear Griffin's last-

53:26.320 --> 53:27.520
No, sir.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.360
No?

53:28.360 --> 53:29.560
No, you want more show?

53:29.560 --> 53:30.920
I got something.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.560
You got something?

53:32.560 --> 53:35.700
As you know, we've done flip the calendar over.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.940
It's a whole new month.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.000
Ah, fuck.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.440
And you know what that means?

53:41.440 --> 53:42.280
God damn it.

53:42.280 --> 53:43.120
I knew that.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.100
I know, I do know what this means, Griffin.

53:45.100 --> 53:47.400
It means it's time for us to,

53:47.400 --> 53:49.280
to take appreciation,

53:49.280 --> 53:50.720
take some stock in our lives,

53:50.720 --> 53:55.200
and share some wisdom for some March monthly observances.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.040
Oh, Jesus.

53:56.040 --> 53:58.640
Now, my alarm didn't go off this morning,

53:58.640 --> 54:01.880
and I basically ran full throttle into this show

54:01.880 --> 54:04.240
and didn't have time to pick something out of this list.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.280
So I'm going to go down,

54:05.280 --> 54:08.220
and I think we should focus all our attention on one,

54:08.220 --> 54:10.320
but I need your guys' help to help me pick that one.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.240
So I'm just going to name my favorite ones off this list,

54:12.240 --> 54:13.360
and then we can choose the one

54:13.360 --> 54:15.760
that we want to share wisdom about.

54:15.760 --> 54:16.880
Got it.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.600
Bell peppers and broccoli month.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.520
Crunchy, good.

54:21.520 --> 54:25.640
Exotic winter fruit and leeks and green onions month.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.180
A lot of produce.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.340
A lot of produce this month.

54:28.340 --> 54:30.000
I'm not sure I know enough about them,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.180
but I'm glad they can all hang out in their own month.

54:32.180 --> 54:33.020
Yeah.

54:34.080 --> 54:37.200
International expect success month.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.520
Okay, there it is.

54:39.520 --> 54:40.360
I like that.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.300
International mirth month.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.520
That's every month here.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.980
My brother and me.

54:47.640 --> 54:50.700
National cheerleading safety month.

54:50.700 --> 54:51.540
I like that one.

54:52.720 --> 54:53.560
It's dangerous.

54:53.560 --> 54:56.540
National clean up your IRS act month.

54:56.540 --> 54:58.860
Excuse me?

54:58.860 --> 54:59.700
Sure.

55:01.260 --> 55:04.220
Hey MC Hammer, that's been gone long enough.

55:04.220 --> 55:05.940
I think this might actually be the winner.

55:05.940 --> 55:07.980
National eye donor month.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.800
Okay, let's do it right now.

55:11.800 --> 55:12.700
We don't need to go any further.

55:12.700 --> 55:13.540
I'm going down the list.

55:13.540 --> 55:14.360
National eye donor month.

55:14.360 --> 55:15.200
Nothing beats eye donors.

55:15.200 --> 55:18.060
Friends, March is national eye donor month.

55:18.060 --> 55:20.420
So think about it.

55:20.420 --> 55:22.780
Are your kids really worth looking at with both?

55:23.740 --> 55:25.060
My brother, my brother, and me.

55:25.060 --> 55:27.260
Look around, see the flowers blooming

55:27.260 --> 55:28.500
and the children smiling.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.760
Well, some people can't, Stingy.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.100
Give up one of them.

55:32.100 --> 55:33.340
My brother, my brother, and me.

55:33.340 --> 55:35.060
That one didn't flow quite as well

55:35.060 --> 55:37.380
as you anticipated did it.

55:37.380 --> 55:38.220
No.

55:38.220 --> 55:39.060
How about this one?

55:41.260 --> 55:43.660
You know that Jessica Alba movie, The Eye,

55:43.660 --> 55:45.060
where she gets the eye donation

55:45.060 --> 55:47.960
and then she sees demons and it really fucks her shit up?

55:47.960 --> 55:52.380
That only happens like one out of every five eye donations.

55:52.380 --> 55:53.560
So don't worry about it.

55:53.560 --> 55:54.860
My brother, my brother, and me.

55:54.860 --> 55:56.900
I only have eyes for you.

55:56.900 --> 55:57.980
Literally.

55:57.980 --> 55:59.260
My brother, my brother, and me.

55:59.260 --> 56:01.260
Now again, I don't think you.

56:01.260 --> 56:02.080
Damn it.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.500
No.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.660
You're, you want to be a cyclops?

56:07.620 --> 56:08.980
My brother, my brother, and me.

56:13.020 --> 56:16.560
It's like, I just, nope.

56:17.980 --> 56:21.020
The air has just been sucked out of this room.

56:21.020 --> 56:22.780
It's like taking your contacts out

56:22.780 --> 56:25.020
only like times a thousand.

56:25.020 --> 56:27.660
My brother, my brother, and me.

56:27.660 --> 56:28.940
There you go.

56:28.940 --> 56:30.260
See you back on the horse.

56:30.260 --> 56:32.060
Eyepatches.

56:32.060 --> 56:32.900
Uh-huh.

56:36.620 --> 56:37.940
What else are you going to do with all those eye patches?

56:37.940 --> 56:39.440
It's like a permanent wink.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.060
My brother, my brother, and me.

56:45.860 --> 56:48.420
Hey, do you need a tiny hole

56:48.420 --> 56:50.380
to hide a secret treasure map in?

56:50.380 --> 56:51.640
We got you.

56:51.640 --> 56:52.480
My brother, my brother, and me.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.380
You know what you've been wanting to try for a while?

56:54.380 --> 56:55.420
Skull fucking.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.980
My brother, my brother, and me.

56:58.420 --> 57:00.320
Maybe I'll get one of Justin Bieber's.

57:01.500 --> 57:03.220
My brother, my brother, and me.

57:03.220 --> 57:05.820
I like that the idea is that everyone

57:05.820 --> 57:07.340
is trading one to the left.

57:07.340 --> 57:11.060
You're presupposing there's some crazy eye swap going on.

57:12.820 --> 57:13.660
Does that come on that?

57:13.660 --> 57:15.120
Change places.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.160
Musical eyeballs and somebody ends up Helen Keller.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.000
At the end.

57:21.680 --> 57:24.680
My new left eyeball is too big,

57:24.680 --> 57:26.480
and now I look like Forest Whitaker.

57:29.360 --> 57:30.480
That's what happened.

57:30.480 --> 57:34.800
Something happened to Peter Lorre at some point, I guess.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.360
His is just trying to get away.

57:38.160 --> 57:41.320
It's like one of those dogs in every Disney movie ever,

57:41.320 --> 57:44.080
like Milo and Otis, that eye's just trying to get home.

57:46.240 --> 57:47.840
It's unruly.

57:47.840 --> 57:48.960
I like it.

57:48.960 --> 57:50.880
I'm going down this list,

57:50.880 --> 57:53.200
and there's also Play the Recorder month.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.040
Play the Recorder month.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.820
I think we could have turned some comedy out of.

57:56.820 --> 58:00.580
Because people, you thought that people were indifferent

58:00.580 --> 58:02.080
to you playing guitar in the quad.

58:02.080 --> 58:05.400
Well, just hold on one second.

58:05.400 --> 58:06.360
Play the Recorder.

58:06.360 --> 58:08.200
It's like a flute for bitches.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.040
My brother, my brother, and me.

58:09.040 --> 58:11.880
My brother, my brother, and me.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.880
You're just tenth the man Zamfear is.

58:14.880 --> 58:16.040
My brother, my brother, and me.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.360
Zamfear reference.

58:17.360 --> 58:20.960
Yeah, Starsky, and Hutch, and Zamfear this week, I think.

58:20.960 --> 58:21.800
I'll take it.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.380
How deep are those cuts?

58:23.380 --> 58:24.220
There?

58:24.220 --> 58:25.840
I'm going out to the boneyard this week.

58:25.840 --> 58:28.980
I'm gonna get some deep cuts.

58:30.720 --> 58:34.920
So now I do actually want to hear Griffin's last question.

58:36.120 --> 58:40.380
But first, just real quick, this is a big, big deal.

58:41.420 --> 58:43.960
Right now, where can people find it, Griffin?

58:43.960 --> 58:47.400
This thing that we've created.

58:47.400 --> 58:48.700
Well, not we've created.

58:48.700 --> 58:49.540
We did the minimal amount of work on.

58:49.540 --> 58:50.800
But has been created for us.

58:50.800 --> 58:52.880
No, well, I mean, we were involved.

58:53.880 --> 58:54.700
In what?

58:54.700 --> 58:55.760
Oh, the comic?

58:55.760 --> 58:57.120
Yeah.

58:57.120 --> 59:01.080
I'll put it up on the MaximumFun.org front page.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.680
And you will see it there.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.760
And it is a four-page comic

59:04.760 --> 59:06.680
called My Brother, My Brother, Me Origins,

59:06.680 --> 59:11.680
written by me and illustrated by our dear friend,

59:11.680 --> 59:13.340
Michael Maney.

59:14.340 --> 59:16.100
You should follow him on Twitter, by the way.

59:16.100 --> 59:21.100
It's M-I-C-H-A-E-L-M-A-Y-N-E.

59:21.340 --> 59:22.180
You follow him.

59:22.180 --> 59:23.940
He has a great comic called Body Lasts.

59:25.060 --> 59:26.260
And he-

59:26.260 --> 59:28.540
I'm not lying when I say that the comic

59:28.540 --> 59:30.860
is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

59:30.860 --> 59:34.160
It totally beats the shit out of anything we've ever done,

59:34.160 --> 59:35.980
which is kind of disappointing.

59:35.980 --> 59:37.740
It kind of is depressing, yeah.

59:37.740 --> 59:39.780
But if you like it, follow him.

59:39.780 --> 59:42.500
Tell everybody to go get his comic, Body Lasts.

59:43.740 --> 59:48.680
And because it is a sort of a faux origin story, I guess,

59:48.680 --> 59:51.180
of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

59:51.180 --> 59:53.600
A foraging story of how My Brother, My Brother, Me

59:53.600 --> 59:54.440
got started.

59:56.380 --> 59:58.820
It's, like I said, he did a lot of work on it.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.420
And I think it's, even if I hadn't written it,

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.740
I would think it's really funny

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:06.680
because it is just objectively great.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.560
And also you can go to, mainly because of what he did.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.400
I didn't really do that much.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.900
But you can go to bodylastcomic.com

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.760
and see some more of his work.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.300
But it's a super nice thing he did.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.140
It's actually his idea.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.340
We didn't have to badger him into it,

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.460
which is kind of nice too.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.380
This week, you should come see us at PAX East,

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.980
if you're headed out that way.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.220
I think Griffin and I will both be

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.040
at the Joystick Podcast Live, Friday, 7.30.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.160
I forget the-

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.740
I can't stress enough how much I will not be there.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.820
The extent to which Travis will not be there

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.940
cannot be measured by traditional instruments.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.780
I mean, he will really not be there.

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.340
This would be a good time for you to come

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.820
and tell us that you donated and come get your spoon on.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.260
Come get a spoon.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.740
I am gonna say hugs,

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.700
but Griffin will be offering some spooning.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.120
Where are we laying down?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.060
I don't know, maybe on this ocean of sumo chairs

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.760
that are all over the place.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.580
God, it's gonna be like a comfortable,

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.740
like it'll be like nirvana.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.580
Yeah.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.780
And of course, one last time before we go,

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.740
and think about it,

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.660
this is the last time I've talked about this for a year.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.860
If you guys step up and really just crush it,

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.700
it's the Max Fun Pledge Drive.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.580
At the very least, get in there,

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:23.260
make your five buck pledge and get your stickers

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.840
and your membership card and your bonus content,

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.180
your free shows, your free videos, all that loot,

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.860
and walk away with, most importantly,

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.020
a warm and toasty feeling inside of you

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.780
because you helped develop the thermoboner, A.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.860
B, helped to support something you like

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.420
as much as we hope you like us.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:48.020
And if you can't get five bucks, give more.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.860
Because come on, step up.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.700
Make it hurt.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.840
All we want, all we ask is that you take it to the limit.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.900
Just take it to the limit.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.100
If you can do $35, you get a fricking AMFM radio

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.580
that charges itself like some sort of magic thing

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.140
and charge your phone too, it's incredible.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.540
If you donate, let me ask you this.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.700
If you give a one-time donation of a million dollars,

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.940
I will have sex with you.

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.660
You're welcome.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.100
No, no, no. You're welcome.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.220
What's that movie, Indecent Proposal?

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.220
Sexy Proposal.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.360
Sexy Proposal Time.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.200
Million bucks?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.040
I'll fuck you.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.420
I'll break you off your fuck, no big deal.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.420
Dude or lady?

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.260
Dude or lady?

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.820
You making any boundaries?

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.940
If it's a dude, I'm gonna say 1.5 mil,

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.180
just because that would be a pretty significant change

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.020
in my life.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.300
That would constitute a pretty big sea change.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.420
It's a pretty crazy branch that you just said.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.700
In order for that to pan out,

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.460
I'm gonna need a little extra cheddar,

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.080
a little extra Velveeta on them notch bros.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:47.320
But for a lady, beautiful, beautiful lady, 1 mil.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.340
For a not so beautiful lady, 1.2.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.580
We'll cut, we'll, we'll, we'll.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.000
What about a beautiful man?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.980
Beautiful man?

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:54.820
1.2.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:57.820
Sounds good.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.140
Hey, I think we just learned a Griffin McElroy secret,

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.900
which is hot dudes and ugly women

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.780
are in the same sexual hour three days.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.220
In the same biosphere.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.180
As always, you can go to mbnbam.com,

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.180

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.500
Thank you guys for your support

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.500
and thanks for hanging out with us.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.260
And we hope you appreciate the comic,

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.240
which is just sort of our little way of saying

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.520
thanks for being here and thanks for,

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.980
thanks for being our friends still.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.780
And Griffin, last question.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.300
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker as well.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.260
Thanks, Jacob Locker.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Spanna, who asks,

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.660
can babies see spirits?

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.860
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.020
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.380
This has been my brother, my brother Nate.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.220
He's your dad.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:56.220
Let's go wear on the lips.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.300
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.340
Keep your heart.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.500
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.460
Keep your heart.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.460
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:06.180
These girls are smart.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:25.180
Play your part.
