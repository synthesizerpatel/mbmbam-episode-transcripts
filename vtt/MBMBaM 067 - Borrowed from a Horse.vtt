00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.880 --> 00:47.760
Hello, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.480 --> 00:54.960
Travis has prepared today's introductions himself, which I will permit him to do now.

00:54.960 --> 01:02.640
Hello, weary travelers. Take respite upon yon stump by the fire.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.800
Enjoy a bowl of stew as we recount some wisdom.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.280
I just hate this so much.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.320
I just finished my creative writing course at the Adult Learning Annex.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.800
You are listening to the number one EverQuest podcast on the net. Who's your favorite?

01:24.800 --> 01:30.720
What's your favorite race? I like Kunark. Who can pick? I like Elfson, Elfton.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.680
Listen, you did your best. I want to take a moment, of course,

01:37.680 --> 01:43.520
to congratulate Miss Jennifer Hudson, who is now a size zero, if you can believe that.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.520
She's invisible? Yeah, that's what I want to- she's just shrunk out of existence.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.600
She has winked out of existence. If you look at her directly,

01:53.600 --> 01:57.680
you can you can no longer see her. She has engine a two-dimensional plane.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.240
She has gone from a size 16 to a size zero. She lives in flat land now.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.680
She's like flat Stanley. She's basically the flat Stanley of humans.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.560
That's Jennifer Hudson in a nutshell, but congratulations to her. Looking great.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.320
Size zero, something for all of us to strive for, I think.

02:14.320 --> 02:20.000
It's going to be hard for me to choose which of those two introductions to edit out.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.840
Well, we like to give Griffin a lot of options here. He never, you never know.

02:25.840 --> 02:31.680
Hey, GOP race, Bachman, Bachman, Huntsman. It's Ron Paul.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.200
Sorry? Sorry?

02:33.200 --> 02:37.680
Ron Paul, the GOP. Are you just saying words that you could

02:37.680 --> 02:39.920
add together just for the funny? Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.600
The Republican elephant. Ron Paul, Republican Party.

02:43.600 --> 02:52.400
Tim Pawlenty. Tim Pawlenty, delicious. Tim Pawlenty is out. Tim Pawlenty is savory.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.600
Oh, man. So many good options. So Griffin, you just picked-

02:57.600 --> 03:02.480
Where's Tim Placenta? They buried him in the backyard.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.760
He dropped out after about nine months. Hey, listen, bazing. This is my brother,

03:07.760 --> 03:09.760
my brother, meeting my shift for the modern era. I'm your oldest-

03:09.760 --> 03:18.320
Smurfs! Have you seen that Smurfs movie? NPH is in the mix. Making it rain. Jokes.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.000
Travis, please introduce yourself. No, you don't get to this week.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.080
Griffin, you go. Travis lost his chance.

03:24.080 --> 03:29.280
I'm Griffin. I'm Griffin McElroy, the fire starter of intros.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.160
Twisted fire starter. I am the master mage known as Travis McElroy.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.920
We need a new Travis for next week, so that's just something to keep on the to-do list.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.400
Something for my honey-do list is to replace Travis.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.640
Quick story. While driving down the streets of Austin, one of my friends saw a burn CD

03:46.640 --> 03:51.120
laying on the street, and he jumped out and grabbed the burn CD, and we threw it in the CD player.

03:51.120 --> 03:57.200
It said SPIN on it, and it was nothing but fucking the most righteous pump-up jams you

03:57.200 --> 04:03.200
had ever- Crystal Method and Prodigy and Fire Starter was on there. Smack My Bitch Up is also

04:03.200 --> 04:10.880
on there. It was a fucking- it was like music to have a very moody bank heist to. It was fucking

04:10.880 --> 04:16.800
fresh. SPIN. That's the only thing on it. SPIN. No other hints or anything?

04:18.160 --> 04:21.920
Just put it in there. Let it go. Let it go. Feel yourself.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.400
I'm really proud of you for putting that into a CD player.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.280
Yeah, a little scratched, but yeah, it could have been bad, man.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.880
Could have been in, like, The Ring. Or it could have been Fart Touch.

04:36.240 --> 04:42.800
SPIN this. SPIN this up. Hey, let's get to some advice. I've been told that I look like Jack Black.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.280
It's been happening to me for years, and most everyone seems to see it. I've even been stopped

04:47.280 --> 04:51.440
by the street by some random lady to be told that I look like Jack Black. So my question to you,

04:51.440 --> 04:54.640
brothers, is it a good thing to look like Jack Black? Gmail.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.480
Is it a good thing to look like anyone these days?

04:58.480 --> 05:04.080
As someone who has been told, uh, for ever and ever and ever that I look like Chris Catan,

05:04.880 --> 05:07.440
it's not good to look like anybody ever.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.160
The problem is-

05:08.160 --> 05:13.120
Because you get told once and you go, huh, that's interesting. Maybe a little bit flattered.

05:13.120 --> 05:19.040
Maybe a little bit skeptic. You get told a million times. I don't care who it is you look like.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.520
You start to, like, lose your sense of self.

05:21.520 --> 05:26.800
Well, Travis, to that effect, you seem to have embraced your Catan- Catanism.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.480
Catanity.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.480
Because you're Catanity because you used- you went as Mango for Halloween.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.200
I did. Well, what happened was I came full circle. I went full circle from

05:37.920 --> 05:43.680
do I to fuck you to I do. It was a big circle.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.320
You can't do much worse than Jack Black, I don't think, though.

05:47.520 --> 05:52.000
Because a lot of people look like Jack Black. Like, Jack Black looks like a lot of people.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.120
Not a lot of famous people.

05:53.120 --> 05:58.880
Cool. Not a lot of- not a lot of people that people like out there doing it look like Jack Black.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.080
Um, a lot of roadies look like Jack Black, I guess.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.400
Uh, a lot of guys who run the go-karts look like Jack Black.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.840
Not a lot of, like, famous popular people look like Jack Black.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.040
A lot of go-kart technicians look like Jack Black.

06:13.040 --> 06:20.560
I myself have been told by a guy who worked at Heritage Station that I look like Jack Black.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.000
That's horse apples.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.160
How do you feel about- how do you feel about it when it happens?

06:24.160 --> 06:29.200
Well, maybe this Gmailer, maybe he is- maybe he looks like Justin McElroy more than anything.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.440
Maybe I need to take it back my face.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.960
Do you think it's just because, um, in the chubby famous people game,

06:36.960 --> 06:41.840
you've basically got Jack Black and Kevin James just sort of living on the edge?

06:41.840 --> 06:42.240
Right.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.760
I wonder if anyone's ever been told, like, you look like a skinny Jack Black.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.000
Well, that's the problem, right?

06:48.000 --> 06:53.440
Like, how fat you are, like, be glad that people are telling you you look like Jack Black

06:53.440 --> 06:57.040
and not, like, you- you kind of look like Louie Anderson.

06:57.040 --> 07:02.640
Or, like, you look like- who's that fat guy who's so fucking fat that that's the whole joke,

07:02.640 --> 07:04.480
but he was on Last Comic Standing?

07:04.480 --> 07:06.000
Oh, it was, uh, Louie Anderson.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.440
No, no, like, this guy's so fat that, like, he doesn't need punchlines.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.560
He just points to himself.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.160
Oh, Gordo.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.680
Gordo?

07:15.680 --> 07:16.080
You know.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.560
Yeah.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.360
I think he wears, like, garggy wrap clothing, and-

07:19.360 --> 07:20.960
I think it was El Gordo.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.760
It was Gordo.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.360
El Gordo.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.040
He was- he was enormous.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.800
Gordo the Enormous Man was the- was his full name.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.760
His stage name.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.120
Tender-hearted.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.240
Tender-hearted, obviously.

07:32.240 --> 07:32.400
Yeah.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.160
Can you say, on the opposite end of the celebrity weight spectrum, can you say, like,

07:39.200 --> 07:43.760
um, you look like Greg Kinnear, but, like, fat- like a fat-

07:43.760 --> 07:45.520
You look like a fat Greg Kinnear.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.560
You know how Greg Kinnear, like, you know what his body- like, his face, but then with

07:50.560 --> 07:51.920
a Louie Anderson body.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
You look like an ugly Brad Pitt.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.160
You look like a skinny, fat-

07:56.160 --> 07:57.040
Jennifer Hudson.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.120
You look like a fluctuating Jennifer Hudson.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
After she got her weight right- well, that's the thing, though.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.200
Like, if- 10 years ago, if someone told you you look like Jonah Hill, he'd be like,

08:07.200 --> 08:08.560
hey, fuck you, man.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.160
Well, 10 years ago, you probably wouldn't know who that was.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.200
We'll say five.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.720
Fuck you, I don't look like Jonah Hill.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.320
Now it's- it's trimmed down.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.400
Now it's kind of a nice- now it's kind of a nice thing.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.080
Yeah, but nobody means that.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.000
Nobody means that, like, him and his prime.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.760
Nobody means like-

08:21.760 --> 08:23.760
You look like- you look like Jonah Hill.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.400
No, no, no, no, no.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.640
Post- post weight loss.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.520
Yeah, no one thinks like you look like- you look like Green Hornet era Seth Rogen, who

08:31.520 --> 08:33.520
looks like he could actually, like, throw a punch.

08:33.520 --> 08:39.280
You look like- you look like, uh, Seth Rogen from 40 Year Old Virgin, probably, or maybe

08:39.280 --> 08:40.720
even one of his fatter movies.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.160
I think that there are two ways to capitalize on this, and one is we had a friend

08:44.160 --> 08:47.360
named Josh who looked like, uh, Owen Wilson.

08:48.320 --> 08:54.400
And so he went to, uh, one of the big acting audition conferences, and they convinced all

08:54.400 --> 08:59.680
these ladies that he was, uh, Luke and Owen Wilson's brother, Josh Wilson.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.000
That sounds like a real jerk.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.080
No, it was- it was funny.

09:05.120 --> 09:10.000
Problem is, uh, he was actually the only guy I know from college that has gone on to work

09:10.000 --> 09:10.960
in TV and film.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.800
You can actually find him in a Nickelback video.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.080
Oh, bummer.

09:14.080 --> 09:14.720
Yeah.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.040
So Karma- Karma took care of that guy.

09:17.040 --> 09:17.200
Yes.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.800
Are we talking about photograph or-

09:18.800 --> 09:20.320
Yeah, who can keep track?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.600
I- I can't.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.040
But I'm pretty sure it is.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.600
No, not photograph, because I would remember that.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.800
It's one of those other ones.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.920
It's one of their bad ones.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.120
Oh, okay.

09:29.120 --> 09:34.000
And I think the second way to capitalize on it is, uh, with this sentence.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.640
Hi, I'm Jack Black, and I'm robbing this bank.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.840
Okay, well, hold on.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.440
You're talking about ways to make this work for you.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.200
You're talking about identity theft.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.360
Yes, but, like, literal identity.

09:45.360 --> 09:50.240
Not just, like, I'm using his credit card, but, like, you become Jack Black, and then

09:50.240 --> 09:51.120
you run amok.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.360
Did you see that?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.120
Jack Black just stabbed that dude.

09:55.680 --> 09:55.920
Yeah.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.520
I just saw- I saw Jack Black sneaking out of your bedroom window.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.360
What's going on?

10:01.360 --> 10:03.760
And then he yelled, I am Jack Black, which-

10:03.760 --> 10:05.280
I'm definitely Jack Black!

10:05.280 --> 10:06.000
More convincing.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.080
Except no substitute.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.520
Dude, tell him Jack Black looks like you.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.520
Say you've had this face for a long time.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.040
He needs to- he needs to get over it.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.440
Although, he's been around a while, at this point.

10:18.640 --> 10:19.600
You could shave your head.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.400
People never say that again.

10:22.400 --> 10:28.560
Um, I- just real quick, in this email, they have- there's a typo, and he says Jack Back,

10:28.560 --> 10:30.160
which I actually kind of like a little bit better.

10:30.160 --> 10:34.800
Like, it sounds like- that sounds like, uh, some sort of, like, dystopian future techno

10:34.800 --> 10:35.360
hacker name.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.640
I'm Jack- I'm Jack Back.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.280
Over there in the corner is Psycho.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.200
Up there is Lil Doogie.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.800
There's Jack Back.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.840
Dutch, Dutch.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.640
We got Jack Back.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.240
We got wheels.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.160
We've got Vid Kid.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.560
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.760
You've just skewed into the Burger King, uh, kids club.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.360
Got Hamburglar, Fry Guy, Mary McCheese.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.720
Don't fuck with Grimace.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.680
Don't fuck with Grimace.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.320
He's a hacker.

11:02.320 --> 11:06.320
Here, imagine Grimace wearing, like, hacker glasses.

11:06.320 --> 11:11.600
Imagine Grimace hacking this big, stupid, purple oven mitt- hands, just smash like it's

11:11.600 --> 11:12.320
a keyboard.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.520
See, now I'm imagining-

11:13.520 --> 11:17.520
He pushes his hands together, and there is forso- inexplicably knuckle cracking.

11:19.920 --> 11:25.440
See, you're telling me all this, and I'm thinking of, uh, of Grimace in the movie Swordfish,

11:25.440 --> 11:29.360
and then I'm thinking of Grimace in the role of Halle Berry in the movie Swordfish,

11:29.360 --> 11:33.760
and then I'm thinking about Grimace's tits.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.560
Not again.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.040
That's where-

11:35.040 --> 11:35.600
Not again.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.040
That's for the third time today.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.400
But conveniently, they are filled with grape jam, which is great with McDonald brand biscuits.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.640
Oh no, that's gotta be jelly.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.680
Jam don't shake like that.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.440
Thank you, Grimace.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.240
I do love Grimace.

11:48.240 --> 11:56.240
Hey, is it ever appropriate or a good idea to hit on a member of a band after her set?

11:56.240 --> 12:01.280
That's from Nicky, who has informed us he is a male, which he's coming on a little strong.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.160
I don't know, but I believe him.

12:04.160 --> 12:10.640
That I think Nicky's a male, and he wants to know if he can hit on, uh, a female.

12:10.640 --> 12:16.000
Just go up to her and say, hey, killer set, rough night, everybody's kung fu fighting.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.880
That should be pretty good.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.120
Do you speak Cantonese?

12:21.120 --> 12:22.480
Yeah, do you speak Cantonese?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.640
This, these are Wayne's World references, yeah?

12:24.640 --> 12:25.120
Yeah.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.440
Um, I mean, I just, I thought we might help this guy out for once.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.400
Oh, for once.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.460
Okay.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.400
I, it depends on the band, doesn't it?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, how big is this band?

12:36.800 --> 12:40.480
Yeah, if it's like fucking Fleetwood Mac and you're trying to get raw with Stevie Nicks,

12:40.480 --> 12:43.120
then you're probably going to have a hard time with that.

12:44.080 --> 12:50.240
But if this is like jam band at your local bar and they just finished doing a cover of

12:50.240 --> 12:52.720
a Fleetwood Mac song, you're probably cool.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.680
Again, it depends on the quality of the Fleetwood Mac cover.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.180
Yeah.

12:58.880 --> 13:05.680
I would say normal, uh, good band is equal to shitty Fleetwood Mac cover band, just by

13:05.680 --> 13:07.760
the quality of the songs that they're playing.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.280
How do you figure, how do you figure?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.600
Uh, have you heard Go Your Own Way?

13:12.480 --> 13:12.980
What?

13:13.520 --> 13:17.120
I'm saying that you, there is no bad cover of Go Your Own Way.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.800
That's fair. He's right.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.320
Here are some, uh, Fleetwood Mac tribute bands.

13:22.320 --> 13:28.400
Belladonna, Enchanted, Mirage, Rumors.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.440
This is getting worse.

13:29.440 --> 13:29.940
Wild Heart.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
Oh, Fleetwood, Fleetwood Macs.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.160
Is it M-A-X?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.200
Yeah, it is. All caps.

13:37.200 --> 13:37.840
Yeah, that's good.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.340
Bitches.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.840
Fleetwood back.

13:41.840 --> 13:47.040
Fleetwood back.

13:47.040 --> 13:52.000
I think that, um, Juice Newton actually started out as a Fleetwood Mac cover person, human

13:52.000 --> 13:52.500
being.

13:52.500 --> 13:52.800
Oh yeah?

13:52.800 --> 13:54.080
Just a cover artist, yeah.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.040
Cover human being?

13:55.760 --> 13:58.320
That's, well, we do have cover human beings though, don't we?

13:58.320 --> 14:01.040
I mean, isn't that something that pops up from time to time?

14:01.040 --> 14:06.320
I just saw, I just saw in an episode of Tyler's and GR's where one of the dads, uh, makes

14:06.320 --> 14:08.640
a living as a Sean Paul impersonator.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.240
Oh my Christ, yes.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.520
Yeah, right?

14:11.520 --> 14:12.720
My name is Ron Paul.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.320
I'm a Sean Paul.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.440
Shake that thing.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.760
I literally, like, got up and walked out of the room when I saw that because all I could

14:23.760 --> 14:26.720
think was, what is the market for that?

14:26.720 --> 14:27.360
Oh, it's a human.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.280
And Teresa explained it like this.

14:29.280 --> 14:34.640
The only option she could think of was, maybe someone's throwing out, like, a party and

14:34.640 --> 14:37.360
they want people to think that maybe Sean Paul was there.

14:37.360 --> 14:44.320
Or, or, like, more, more likely, I'm robbing this bank and my name is Sean Paul.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.360
My name is Sean Paul.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.600
It's a booming market, Travis.

14:49.600 --> 14:56.560
A lot of, a lot of our stocks are taking dips, but my investment's in the Sean Paul and shaggy

14:56.560 --> 14:57.760
impersonation business.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.000
Sean Paul is just a, Sean Paul is just a shaggy tribute person.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.800
I'm just going to throw this out as just kind of a, a wide, broad piece of advice.

15:06.800 --> 15:12.080
If you decide that you want to become a celebrity impersonator and you look in the mirror and

15:12.080 --> 15:17.440
the best you can come up with is Sean Paul, maybe you should go work at your dad's bank.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.600
I thought that nobody had seen Sean Paul before.

15:19.600 --> 15:24.480
I thought that was, he was like, he was like, he was like Flicky or who's that guy?

15:24.480 --> 15:25.600
The spray painter?

15:25.600 --> 15:28.800
Oh, Flicky, Flicky, it was Flicky.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.920
Flicky the, no, you're thinking of, you're thinking of Daft Punk.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.680
Daft Punk, uh, his, his spray paint skills.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.320
Hey, yeah, nobody's seen his face before.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.520
They've only seen his art.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.560
And that's, so as far as anyone knows, I could be a Sean Paul impersonator.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.120
You'd be Sean Paul.

15:45.120 --> 15:45.600
You'd be Flicky.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.040
They could be the same person.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.480
Big news, big news, everybody.

15:48.480 --> 15:54.720
I didn't want this to be the venue in which I let it come out, but I am Flicky.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.240
Oh my God.

15:56.240 --> 15:56.800
I know.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.040
No, no, I am Flicky.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.240
I am Juice Newton.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.920
And I could never arrest Flicky because we've all claimed to be Flicky.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.720
So now to answer your question.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.720
Don't, don't do that.

16:10.720 --> 16:16.000
If you have the fucking, if you have the balls to like go up actually to a, a musician that

16:16.000 --> 16:18.960
you've just seen and say like, hey, I agree with your style.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.880
Like actually, I'm going to say more power to you.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.040
Cause I, I think step one, take a long hard look in the mirror.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.640
Can you pull it off?

16:26.640 --> 16:27.760
Are you attractive?

16:27.760 --> 16:31.120
If the answer is yes, fuck yeah, do it.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
What does it matter?

16:33.120 --> 16:37.600
What kind of face, if you had to grade your face and body, what are we talking about?

16:37.600 --> 16:38.160
Rate your face.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.320
You're saying if you got a B face and an A body, yeah dog.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.960
Like you are wasting everyone's time by not doing it.

16:44.960 --> 16:49.760
And make sure that you don't, that you approach it like any other circumstance.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.040
You start a conversation first, then get to flirting.

16:53.040 --> 16:57.120
Plus like, but, but do keep in mind that as far as like that natural chemistry or what

16:57.120 --> 17:03.760
have you, part of being a performer is being alluring or at the very least charismatic.

17:03.760 --> 17:09.200
So like, yeah, if you thought, hey, I'm into that, like they're doing their job.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.680
Like that's what they're, that's what they're supposed to do.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.600
There's probably a lot of stage door Johnny's lining up is all I'm saying.

17:17.600 --> 17:23.040
So, you know, I think that you should just ignore, like ignore the fact that you just

17:23.040 --> 17:24.400
saw that person in concert.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.520
I think you should act like you didn't know.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.320
Don't even mention like the music or anything.

17:28.320 --> 17:28.960
Yeah.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.920
And then you'd be like, oh, I didn't know that you were doing anything.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.840
And they'll be like, hey dude, I'm Lady Gaga.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.760
Like, yeah, you know, you know this.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.760
I got here late.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.800
I didn't see your concert.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.280
Why are you wearing a meat mask?

17:41.280 --> 17:42.480
This is a weird look.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.680
Are those pizza panties?

17:46.960 --> 17:49.040
That is my favorite pizza chain.

17:49.040 --> 17:55.760
It's very popular in Japan with the, in the capsule hotels you order from pizza panties.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.960
That is so not surprising.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.080
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

17:58.080 --> 17:58.400
Yeah.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.040
Okay.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.080
I'd like us to explore.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.200
This one was sent in by Terry Dutton.

18:03.200 --> 18:03.760
Thanks, Terry.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.080
It's by a Yahoo answer user.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.080
Jake that thing for Terry Dutton.

18:06.080 --> 18:06.640
Terry Dutton.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.280
Terry Dutton sent this in.

18:09.280 --> 18:09.680
Thank you.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.760
It's by a Yahoo answer user, Morgan Grutman, who asks.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.040
Jake that thing.

18:15.040 --> 18:15.920
It's Morgan Grutman.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.480
Morgan Grutman.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.520
Uh, picking the perfect quote opinions needed.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.480
Getting a tattoo at the end of the month.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.000
And I thought, I thought I had the perfect saying picked out,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.080
but I've come across a few more that I just love.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.600
Uh, if I could have all of them put on, I would.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.680
Just need opinions on which one sounds slash would look best.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.800
I am getting a horse tattoo on my back.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.680
Uh huh.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.000
Not sure if it will be a rearing horse or a galloping horse,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.720
but here are the quotes I can't pick from.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.880
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

18:50.400 --> 18:50.800
Okay.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.440
So that's the first one.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.400
Not a quote.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.680
Not a quote at all.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.120
Two hearts, one passion.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.240
Nope.

18:56.240 --> 18:56.880
Okay.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.680
Hoof prints never fade.

19:00.240 --> 19:00.640
What?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.360
They not.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.560
They don't.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.280
Together.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.720
Scientifically proven.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.280
Wait, wait, wait.

19:07.280 --> 19:07.520
Okay.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.160
Go ahead, Griffin.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.160
Together as one.

19:10.160 --> 19:14.000
Wait, I was going to put this in the tattoo section,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
but who would know better than horse lovers themselves?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.920
I don't want any big long quotes or anything.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.840
Something small and simple, but gets to the point.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.040
It gets to the point of how I'm a crazy person is.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.960
Wait, hold on.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.520
Two hoof prints, one passion.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.280
Two hearts, one passion, which I love.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.920
Like what's the, is the passion going?

19:33.920 --> 19:36.480
Like just moving, moving forward quickly.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.760
Like that's my thing.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.400
Also, what about the horse's second heart?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.120
Huh?

19:41.120 --> 19:41.280
Yeah.

19:41.280 --> 19:41.920
Didn't think about that.

19:43.840 --> 19:48.560
What do you want to bet this person does not in any way own a horse?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.440
No, no horse.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.080
Really, they want to remind themselves to save up for it.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.560
And they think that this is sort of throwing their hat over the fence.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.080
Like if you get this, you got to have a horse.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.440
People are going to think you're an asshole.

19:57.440 --> 20:02.000
Elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.160
Hey, the way that you ride a horse is really bad if fire's involved in the equation.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.840
Maybe you leap through fire as you're going to rescue.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.960
Oh, I ride a-

20:10.960 --> 20:14.800
What shitty quotes did they have before that they heard these and went,

20:14.800 --> 20:16.000
oh no, that's way better.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.000
Now I'm up in the air.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.240
Do, uh, did anybody make any suggestions or anything?

20:21.440 --> 20:24.400
Uh, a lot of people are down with elegance, beauty, spirit, fire.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, it's very elegant.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.520
A rearing horse would be better.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.200
Um, I really like hoof prints never fade, but here are some you may like.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.440
Oh Christ.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.080
In riding a horse, we borrow freedom.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.240
Do we know what?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.200
Excuse me horse.

20:41.200 --> 20:41.840
Can I get a cup of freedom?

20:41.840 --> 20:42.880
Can I just for a second?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.400
Let me, that freedom looks pretty neat.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.200
Can I just check it?

20:46.160 --> 20:47.280
Pardon me neighbor.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.560
Can I get a cup of freedom?

20:50.000 --> 20:53.280
And the horse just looks back and says, you look with your eyes, not with your hand.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.360
Hey, I am bone dry on freedom.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.360
Can I just mount you for a second?

20:57.360 --> 21:02.560
Just a little, to ride a, to ride a, or can I finish?

21:04.320 --> 21:06.720
To ride a horse is to ride the sky.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.600
No, the problem I have with these quotes is that they're objectively untrue.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.360
To ride a horse is to ride a horse.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.840
That's all you're doing.

21:19.040 --> 21:23.200
It's a galloping bundle of bones and meat and you're riding it and that's it.

21:23.200 --> 21:28.800
Her friends do in fact fade pretty quickly. They barely even think, like, what are you doing?

21:28.800 --> 21:32.320
My horse is made of clouds and fire and it sucks to be on it.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.680
It sucks to touch this horse.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.440
Horses, horses lend us the wings we lack.

21:38.480 --> 21:38.800
What?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.800
You're making these up by yourself now.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.440
I'm not making these up because I'm not a fucking crazy person.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.320
Hey everyone, quit borrowing shit from horses.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.360
Like, they're not good lenders.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.280
There are neither a borrower or a lender or a horse me.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.240
That's my, for poor Richard.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.640
To see what man has made, one must get in a car.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.880
To see what God has made, one must get on a horse.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.160
No, to see what God has made, one must get in a horse.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.920
Nice work, Big G.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.360
You really grossed me out with all these horse parts.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.200
Big G, this is some sticky stuff.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.280
To be fair, I did think I was gonna freeze to death out here.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.000
Oh, thank you.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.040
Hey, Big G, I thought these smelled bad on the outside.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.040
Hey, horse, can I borrow your, well, your life?

22:26.160 --> 22:27.520
You may not get this one back.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.240
Hey, horse, can I borrow your heat guts so I don't die?

22:31.120 --> 22:33.600
I need your guts heat to keep my bones warm.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.360
You're so good inside.

22:35.360 --> 22:35.760
Thank you.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.160
How about this quote?

22:38.160 --> 22:39.600
I'm gonna build a chair from your bones.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.200
How about this quote?

22:41.200 --> 22:44.800
To ride a horse is to borrow the entire Billy Joel discography.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.240
How did they figure?

22:47.040 --> 22:49.360
Because it makes as much sense as anything else.

22:51.120 --> 22:51.680
If your horse was-

22:51.680 --> 22:53.840
If this is moving out, then I'm moving out.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.160
To fly a horse up in the sky is you are high.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.320
You are having a reaction to drugs.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.680
This is a different answer.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.960
If your horse is a racehorse,

23:04.480 --> 23:07.120
you were a great champion when you ran the ground shook.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.640
The sky opened and mere mortals parted, parted the way to victory.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.400
Where I'll meet you in the winner's circle,

23:12.400 --> 23:15.440
where I'll put a blanket of flowers on your back.

23:15.440 --> 23:15.680
Okay.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.440
So like a head to toe tattoo.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.920
Why were the mortals on the track?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.160
Get out of the way!

23:22.160 --> 23:23.600
Get out of the way, there's horses!

23:24.800 --> 23:27.680
I feel like horses are kind of like,

23:28.640 --> 23:31.840
kind of like you were talking about with like cats and other house pets.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.800
Can we just leave horses alone?

23:34.800 --> 23:37.920
Can we just let them run free and beautiful?

23:37.920 --> 23:40.640
And not try to capture their essence with your back meat?

23:40.640 --> 23:45.840
It's got to be rough because anyone can become a cat person just by buying a cat.

23:45.840 --> 23:50.320
You can buy a cat nowadays and take care of it for its entire lifespan for like 15 bucks.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.200
Like NBD.

23:51.840 --> 23:55.200
Horses, you really got to go for that crazy.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.840
You really got to, that's a lifestyle change.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.920
A crazy, crazy lifestyle change.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.520
You can't just casually-

24:01.520 --> 24:02.880
You can't take off for the weekend.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.360
To be fair, have you ever watched Animal Cops Houston?

24:07.920 --> 24:08.480
Yes.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.960
It doesn't always require a life kit.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.400
Sometimes you're just like, I brought this horse, it's in my apartment now.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
Oh shit, I forgot I had that horse.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.440
What?

24:17.440 --> 24:20.240
There's a horse behind your barn, you haven't fed it in three weeks.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.200
Oh shit!

24:21.200 --> 24:23.840
Ah fuck, I haven't gone in that guest room in a long time.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.920
Honey.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.600
This has been our sponsored segment where we riff,

24:29.600 --> 24:33.280
and the humor is predicated on having seen Animal Cops Houston.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.040
It's a great show.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.720
Yeah, real class act.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.720
Yeah, real class act. Hey listen.

24:39.440 --> 24:44.240
My friend and I have been planning to take a cross-country road trip

24:44.240 --> 24:46.160
on the cheap for a few weeks now.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.280
Before you finish reading this, I want you both to take a deep breath.

24:50.320 --> 24:50.640
Okay.

24:51.200 --> 24:51.680
Go on.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.760
My friend said he had the sleep accommodations taken care of,

24:55.760 --> 24:58.480
but when I learned his plans for us, I was horrified.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.960
He wants us to spend each night on the couches of random strangers

25:02.960 --> 25:04.800
found via couchsurfing.org.

25:04.800 --> 25:09.840
Apparently, this website lets people invite strangers to crash for the night.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.520
Third place, and in my mind,

25:11.520 --> 25:13.920
die a grisly death at the hands of a serial killer.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.080
Try to dissuade my friend, but he insists it'll be fine,

25:16.080 --> 25:18.000
and there's no other cheap alternative.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.480
How could I convince my friend he's leading us into certain death?

25:20.480 --> 25:21.760
And that's from Stranger Danger.

25:23.440 --> 25:23.920
Why do you-

25:25.120 --> 25:25.440
My-

25:25.440 --> 25:26.240
Why do you need-

25:26.240 --> 25:27.760
Okay, before we get into this too,

25:27.760 --> 25:32.160
my sister-in-law couchsurfed a lot in Europe and Japan,

25:32.160 --> 25:33.600
and it worked out fine for her.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.400
Mm-hmm.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.760
She had no problems.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.160
And I think if you're-

25:36.160 --> 25:37.360
But she knows Crabbe McGraw.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.400
Like, she's fine.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.760
Yeah, she knows Crabbe McGraw, though.

25:39.760 --> 25:40.720
She can handle herself.

25:41.280 --> 25:44.240
My friend Jacqueline, who now lives in New York,

25:44.240 --> 25:45.920
but used to live in Cincinnati with me,

25:45.920 --> 25:49.680
was part of this, like, underground couchsurfing railroad,

25:49.680 --> 25:50.720
and people would, like-

25:50.720 --> 25:51.440
Hold on.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.640
She couchsurfed her way to freedom from oppression?

25:54.640 --> 25:55.200
No, no, no.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.400
She was one of the stops.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.240
Come ride this wave of freedom.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.280
I borrowed it from a horse.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.400
Woo!

26:00.400 --> 26:01.360
Hang ten!

26:01.360 --> 26:05.040
But nothing bad ever happened. People came and slept on her couch,

26:05.040 --> 26:07.440
and, like, you know, would stay a night or two.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.640
I hung out with one dude.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.240
The three of us went to a Zen church together,

26:12.240 --> 26:13.680
and he was awesome. He was great.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.400
Okay, but you're gonna have maybe 99 of those,

26:18.400 --> 26:21.280
and then you're gonna have one, you wake up,

26:21.280 --> 26:23.680
and fucking Kathy Bates is looming over you,

26:23.680 --> 26:25.920
like, hey, you are-

26:25.920 --> 26:27.200
No, it's not worth it.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.240
It's not worth the risk.

26:28.240 --> 26:31.600
I organized your spices for you because I thought they were disorganized.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.960
Like, even little things.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.640
That's gonna be annoying. Why'd you do that?

26:34.640 --> 26:37.840
Wait, it is worth the risk, though, because it's, like, free.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.040
Yeah.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.560
Like, it's free to get killed, is what you're saying.

26:42.560 --> 26:42.880
Yeah.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.840
Like, it doesn't cost anything either.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.520
Well, yeah, but it's just like going to a hostel in, like, in Europe is-

26:47.520 --> 26:50.960
Yeah, it's a cheaper alternative because the security is at a minimum.

26:50.960 --> 26:51.600
Uh-huh.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.160
Yeah, it's just like the-

26:52.160 --> 26:52.960
Like, what are you saying?

26:52.960 --> 26:55.440
It is- You're right, Chaps, it's just like the movie Hostel.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.440
Like, what are you saying?

26:57.440 --> 26:58.320
What are you saying?

26:58.320 --> 26:59.360
Yeah, what I'm saying is-

26:59.920 --> 27:02.560
You're saying it's free, so there's a likelihood that you'll die.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.440
Is that what you mean?

27:03.440 --> 27:06.320
That's part- I think it's factored into the cost.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.120
Travis, there's no-

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
That's the biggest corner you can cut.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.880
Once you have cut that corner, and you get cut-

27:12.880 --> 27:15.040
How do you mitigate that risk exactly?

27:15.760 --> 27:19.680
Well, my argument comes from the line,

27:19.680 --> 27:23.440
there's no other cheap alternative, so clearly you're trying to save money.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.600
I can get on fucking Kayak and find a Motel 8 for fucking $40.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.320
Which is $40 more than a free couch.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.240
My life is worth so much more than $40.

27:32.960 --> 27:33.280
And also-

27:33.280 --> 27:36.240
Maybe yours is, that doesn't mean the question askers is.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.440
Hey, if you, uh, have been planning to take a cross-country road trip,

27:39.440 --> 27:43.040
how the fuck are we going to pay for this is a pretty high up bullet point.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.000
Yeah, that's never-

27:44.000 --> 27:44.720
Okay, that's fair.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.640
That's the thing you do before you do anything else.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.760
Okay, can we afford to take a cross-country road trip?

27:49.760 --> 27:51.440
Well, do you mind risking death?

27:51.440 --> 27:52.800
Yeah, I do mind that.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.240
Well, no, we can't afford that right now.

27:54.240 --> 27:58.000
We can't afford it, unless, is it cool if we sleep on 12 couches,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.760
and on one of them, you don't know which one,

27:59.760 --> 28:02.480
but on one of them, you'll wake up with some balls in your mouth.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.520
I'm also gonna throw out that maybe your mistake was letting you

28:05.520 --> 28:08.640
skeezy hippie friend take care of accommodations.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.920
Oh man, don't worry.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.720
Hey, bro, we just need a little gas to get us across the border.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.040
What do you mean you got this?

28:15.040 --> 28:17.360
It's like a seven day trip, where are we staying?

28:17.360 --> 28:18.640
I got it, it'll be fine.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.320
Hey, this dude says if I suck his dick, he'll take us as far as Las Cruces.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.240
It's gonna be real cool.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.080
Hey, we're going to the rainbow gathering.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.200
Can you spare some gas, bro?

28:27.760 --> 28:29.680
Hey, bro, can I siphon out?

28:30.720 --> 28:34.400
I'll siphon some gas, then I'll siphon some other stuff.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.520
Need a ride, going to rainbow gathering in the forest.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.240
Actually, I gave, in Cincinnati, I gave some hippies gas

28:40.240 --> 28:41.280
to go to the rainbow gathering.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.920
That's a good use of money.

28:43.920 --> 28:44.720
I felt pretty good about it.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.920
I gave him like a 15.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.000
Anything that gets hippies to go away from you

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
is a pretty good use of money.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.280
Yeah, I said drive fast.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.080
Drive fast, don't look back.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.360
Drive fast and far, hippie.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.160
I called him a slur, which I will not repeat on the show.

28:58.960 --> 28:59.520
That's good.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.440
Sure, why not?

29:10.240 --> 29:12.480
Like, maybe your life isn't worth a whole lot, though.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.760
I don't know this guy personally.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.520
He's using a code name.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.480
Like, maybe he's not one of the Wonders, as Natalie Marchant would say.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.080
You know, maybe it wouldn't be no great loss.

29:20.080 --> 29:20.580
I don't know.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.200
Hold on, I'm going to check something out here real quick.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.480
You guys keep talking.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.200
Okay, cool.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.480
Thanks for the alert.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.800
Yeah, I'm just, I'm so uncomfortable.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.360
I don't like sleeping on the couches of people that I know.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.400
Like, yeah, I certainly don't think of it as surfing

29:36.400 --> 29:38.000
or any other kind of extreme sport.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Here's, okay, here's what I have confirmed because I thought.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.400
What the difference here is that the couchsurfing.org that they talk about

29:49.840 --> 29:54.880
is like a forum kind of thing where people go and will sleep somewhere

29:54.880 --> 29:56.080
and then get on and say,

29:56.080 --> 29:57.920
I stayed at this house and it was perfectly fine.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.320
Oh yeah, I mean, there's no quality assurance in this thing.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.600
Like, there's not like a,

30:01.600 --> 30:05.520
oh yeah, he's a definite, he's a confirmed non-rapist member.

30:05.520 --> 30:05.920
So let's.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.160
No, that's what couchsurfing.org is.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.280
The collection is saying,

30:09.280 --> 30:11.520
but this one is safe, go to this and everybody.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.920
So they didn't kill me this time, so you're cool.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.240
Cause you know what serial killers aren't is patient.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.560
Yeah, they'll wait.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.600
I'm not going to kill this one,

30:20.160 --> 30:21.280
but I'm going to kill the next one.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.360
I'm going to see if I can get two.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.440
This is one of those few times I'm going to stick to my guns

30:25.440 --> 30:27.760
because all of my friends that use this,

30:27.760 --> 30:30.000
if I on this podcast go, yeah, they'll probably kill you.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.080
I'm going to catch shit for the next two weeks.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.160
Because after those two weeks,

30:34.160 --> 30:35.600
all your friends will be fucking murdered

30:35.600 --> 30:37.760
because they slept on some strange couch in Arkansas.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.840
Go to the store right now.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.360
I'm going to say it'll probably be like a, how many days?

30:43.360 --> 30:46.240
Let's say a two week journey, cross country.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.360
If you really put pedal to the metal,

30:47.360 --> 30:49.680
let's say you just stay with 12 strangers,

30:49.680 --> 30:50.960
maybe 20 if you have to go back.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.760
But anyway, let's say you stay with 12 strangers the whole time.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.960
Get in line at the gas station with 12 people.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.400
And as you're looking at that line,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.600
really imagine all of them one by one turning around and saying,

31:03.600 --> 31:04.800
do you want to sleep with me tonight?

31:04.800 --> 31:06.160
Do you want to sleep at my house?

31:06.160 --> 31:07.600
How many of them would you agree to?

31:08.160 --> 31:08.800
Like none.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.320
What if the rest of that sentence was, I'm making biscuits?

31:12.320 --> 31:17.360
Like three, a three out of 12 tops, tops would be biscuit worthy.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.560
Can I suggest what might be the funniest new thing

31:20.560 --> 31:23.440
probably on the internet is, and I haven't checked this.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.560
I haven't looked or anything,

31:24.560 --> 31:29.200
but I would like to read the profiles of new,

31:29.200 --> 31:32.080
entirely new members on couchsurfing.org.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.200
Okay.

31:33.200 --> 31:37.680
I think that this is going to be a rough and tumble crew of maybe rapists

31:37.680 --> 31:39.520
that you can find on the internet.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.560
God, this is a tough one.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.040
I know people do it and they're fine,

31:43.040 --> 31:44.560
but here's what you have to accept.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.920
You have to accept that when they tell your story on 60 minutes

31:48.480 --> 31:51.520
and the guy says everything started to go bad

31:51.520 --> 31:54.240
when the boys decided they would stay with strangers

31:54.240 --> 31:55.440
they met on the internet.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.360
Like that's the point where everybody's going to be like,

31:57.360 --> 31:58.800
well, what did they expect?

31:58.800 --> 31:59.920
Of course you're going to get killed.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.000
I bet Chris Hansen visits this website and just cries.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.280
He's like, it's all for nothing.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.680
They didn't listen.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.360
They didn't listen to the things I said.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.000
Now this is the one thing I will say.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.160
It sounds like of the two of these people,

32:16.160 --> 32:18.320
the question asker is not comfortable with it.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.560
The person they're traveling with is.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.600
If you're not comfortable with it, don't.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.560
You aren't going to get,

32:25.120 --> 32:27.440
you're not going to get more comfortable with it.

32:27.440 --> 32:27.760
Right.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.640
Especially not if you listen to a podcast where three people are like,

32:30.640 --> 32:32.480
oh yeah, they're just going to touch your butthole

32:32.480 --> 32:33.520
while you're unconscious.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.520
Because I know I wouldn't do it.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.400
Yeah, I wouldn't either.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.720
And I know that people who actually do this,

32:38.720 --> 32:39.360
if you talk to them,

32:39.360 --> 32:41.520
I bet they would probably get kind of offended.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.320
Like, no, that's not our culture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.600
I'm sorry, there's just no,

32:45.600 --> 32:48.720
there's not enough QA on this to be able to safely do this.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.920
Yeah, I need moderators.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.520
Yeah, like a review, like a Zagats.

32:54.080 --> 32:54.880
If it goes down.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.720
Can we do a Couchsurfing Zagats?

32:56.720 --> 32:58.400
I need accountability.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.480
If shit goes down, I need a manager.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.440
Can I speak to your manager, couchsurfing.org?

33:03.440 --> 33:06.080
Because I got mouth fucked while I was unconscious.

33:06.800 --> 33:07.920
No stars.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.640
No stars.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.680
I give this house no stars out of five

33:11.680 --> 33:14.560
because my mouth got fucked while I was asleep in it.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.600
Boo, couchsurfing.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.040
I'm never doing this again.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.760
Hang ten nuts in your mouth while you're unconscious.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.280
Couchsurfing.org.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.480
Get a half pipe.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.760
Have you been the other side of the country?

33:29.760 --> 33:32.480
There's nothing worth getting mouth fucked over there.

33:32.480 --> 33:32.720
No.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.400
It's basically just they call,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.800
they call a Hardee's Carl's Jr.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.600
That's it.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.720
Like that's the whole bit.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.760
So I can't leave Texas.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.840
It's just 10 hours in any direction

33:44.560 --> 33:47.600
of people who want my sweet mouth.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.560
Nothing I can do about it.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.520
There's only one thing worth traveling to,

33:51.520 --> 33:52.640
in my opinion.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.600
What's that Justin?

33:53.600 --> 34:05.040
Well, that's the Money Zone.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.480
This week's take us to the Money Zone is Nicole.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.240
A dear friend, Nicole.

34:10.240 --> 34:13.680
She's wishing her boyfriend Steve Marincons.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.760
Marincons, I believe.

34:15.760 --> 34:18.160
It's M-A-R-I-N-C-O-N-Z.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.320
A very happy 24th birthday.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.400
If you're sending in a Money Zone request

34:22.400 --> 34:24.720
and you don't include phonetic pronunciations,

34:25.440 --> 34:27.120
you're wasting everyone's time.

34:27.120 --> 34:27.600
It's okay.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800
He's a big nerd.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.720
And that's her words, not ours.

34:32.720 --> 34:33.360
And she says,

34:33.360 --> 34:34.800
Steve, I adore you.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.440
And I hope you enjoy your minor moment of fame

34:38.240 --> 34:39.280
on this M-A-V-M-B-A-M.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.160
Happy birthday.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.000
Happy birthday, Monkey Butt.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.560
Monkey Butt.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.000
Thank you, Travis, for saying that.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.800
Happy birthday to you, Monkey Butt.

34:50.000 --> 34:50.560
From your-

34:50.560 --> 34:53.120
And a happy birthday, Monkey Butt, to all.

34:53.120 --> 34:53.520
Are we-

34:54.240 --> 34:55.680
Greetings, traveler.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.640
Welcome, weary Monkey Butt.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.800
Your birthday journeys have led you here.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.520
Can I do a jingle?

35:03.520 --> 35:03.840
Yeah.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.400
Yes.

35:04.400 --> 35:04.800
I know I said I wouldn't.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.160
I thought you weren't doing it for humans anymore.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.280
Well, we've only got the one,

35:07.280 --> 35:10.240
and I feel like if people go a week without-

35:10.240 --> 35:11.280
I'll make it short.

35:11.280 --> 35:11.520
Okay.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.120
I like the idea of a minor moment of fame.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.080
Enjoy your five fucking moments of fame.

35:18.080 --> 35:24.000
It's all you're getting, Steve.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.280
That's what you can do for people from now on.

35:27.280 --> 35:27.920
They'll love that.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.200
So if you want to get on our Jumbotron,

35:33.200 --> 35:34.800
as we say, just go to maximumfun.org

35:34.800 --> 35:37.840
forward slash Jumbotron, appropriately enough,

35:38.400 --> 35:42.560
and we'll wish your Monkey Butt a happy something or other.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.320
Please don't make us say that kind of stuff.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.880
We can either do personal messages

35:46.880 --> 35:48.080
or business messages.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.760
So if you want to talk about your website

35:49.760 --> 35:52.160
or your podcast or your web comic or something,

35:52.160 --> 35:54.400
you can also get that hooked up as well.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.200
Have we talked about-

35:55.200 --> 35:55.760
Did you say-

35:55.760 --> 35:58.400
Did you just mention like a dating ad?

35:58.960 --> 36:00.240
They brought that idea up a long time ago.

36:00.240 --> 36:00.880
We've never done it.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.320
Nobody's ever had the balls to do it.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.000
But if you want us to sell you as a sexual competitor-

36:06.000 --> 36:06.800
Oh my God.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.520
We will do that.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.280
We will fucking do that.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.320
I will give you 100% sexual partner guarantee.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.280
Guarantee.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.880
We will get your dick wet.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.240
Or your lady dick wet.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.680
Hey, have you used getyourladydickwet.com surfing.org?

36:22.560 --> 36:25.520
It's this crazy website where you can travel across the country

36:25.520 --> 36:29.440
and stay in beds with people and you will have sex with them.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.880
It's like being a gigolo or a juggalo.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.120
Hey, you know-

36:35.120 --> 36:37.360
Have you been to juggalosurfing.org?

36:40.640 --> 36:41.360
That was crazy.

36:41.360 --> 36:45.680
I was saying I was in Vegas and I actually stayed with Shaggy2dope.

36:45.680 --> 36:50.240
Yeah, JVicious and Cloudnasty will get up on the board.

36:50.240 --> 36:53.280
Cloudnasty made me peanut butter and banana french toast in the morning.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.560
It was the best.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.360
It was the best.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.240
Later on, Lady Death Mask came over and we had sex.

37:00.240 --> 37:00.880
It was great.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.560
What a fun weekend.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.360
Can I open up with a Yahoo?

37:05.360 --> 37:06.080
Yeah, please do.

37:07.840 --> 37:10.240
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.360
Jacob Blocker.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.880
Jacob Blocker, the prodigal son.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.160
Haven't gotten one from JL in a little while, but he's coming back to the fold

37:16.160 --> 37:19.680
and I welcome him with arms that are also welcome.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user William T who asks,

37:24.080 --> 37:26.800
how do I make a homemade belly shirt neatly?

37:27.360 --> 37:30.400
Also, is it okay for guys to wear them?

37:31.680 --> 37:34.240
You should ask question two first.

37:34.240 --> 37:38.240
I'm a straight guy who loves to wear belly shirts.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.760
I've worn them since I was eight.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.680
It feels good to show off my abs.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.360
I even run the neighborhood wearing them.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.120
My belly is a nice tan.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.320
I've made my first belly shirt recently with only scissors.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.920
It's nice, but it looks ripped up.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.200
How can I cut them more neatly?

37:53.280 --> 37:57.360
First of all, if you're trying to, if you have abs,

37:58.160 --> 38:01.120
like a sweet tan rippling ocean of ab meat,

38:01.680 --> 38:03.600
you can't call it your belly anymore.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.520
Like check out my sexy tum tum.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.680
Like what you see?

38:09.680 --> 38:10.880
Look at this gut.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.920
Yeah, exactly.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.040
It's not a gut anymore.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.080
It's not a belly.

38:14.080 --> 38:19.840
I got some Bradley Cooper fucking ripped, chiseled, blasted guts bag.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.000
You can't call it your guts bag anymore.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.680
Once you're chiseled, it's your abs or your old abadabas.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.760
Yeah, your abadabas.

38:29.760 --> 38:30.160
I like that.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.680
Your abadabadoos.

38:31.680 --> 38:32.320
Yeah.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.440
Abadabarinos.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.480
There's a lot of different things.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.240
Now, as far as making, okay,

38:36.240 --> 38:39.120
is it appropriate for a man to wear a belly shirt?

38:39.120 --> 38:41.280
No, no, no.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.000
Well, I don't know if you're fucking, if you're so blasted,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.400
if you have like a butt on your torso,

38:46.400 --> 38:48.960
if that's like, that's what it is when you have good enough abs

38:48.960 --> 38:51.120
is basically a butt on your torso.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.480
Like it's a sexy good butt.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.320
Then like, I think you've earned it.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.400
Like, okay, but let's turn it around.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.160
I have the sexiest back.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.320
Is it all right for a dude to wear a backless shirt?

39:01.120 --> 39:04.880
Like is it like a low cut backless shirt?

39:04.880 --> 39:06.800
Or crotchless pizza panties?

39:06.800 --> 39:07.520
Yeah.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.320
Oh, man.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.080
Listen, listen, listen.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.400
If the worry is, I think by appropriate,

39:12.400 --> 39:14.880
he means are people gonna think he's gay?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.640
Because he makes a point of saying the thing.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.600
Oh, okay, well, yes.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.800
I'm straight.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.560
But like, if you're that chiseled,

39:20.560 --> 39:25.440
people, I assume if I see a fit person, they're a homosexual.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.200
Is that biased of me?

39:27.200 --> 39:27.440
No, no, no.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.560
I think it's a positive image of the homosexual community.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.640
I feel like they're the only ones taking care of themselves.

39:32.640 --> 39:32.800
Yeah.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.480
That's how they're gonna breed us out of existence.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.080
Listen, you can't be upset by that

39:36.080 --> 39:38.320
because of the show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.360
That show existed to be like, hey, we're taking care of ourselves.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.480
Get on it, straight people.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.680
I mean, it makes sense.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.760
They have so much skin in the game.

39:45.760 --> 39:49.120
Like they're more heterosexuals than there are of them,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.280
so they have to be like on fucking point.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.720
They have to be at the top of their game.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.080
I think that makes sense.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.360
I don't think that's mean to say.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.360
Well, it's very nice to say.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.840
I just don't know if it's fair or unfair to their community.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.040
I think it's totally fair.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.120
I mean, I'm blasted and ripped and chiseled,

40:03.120 --> 40:08.560
and my core is, my delts, my delta burps are fucking blasted.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.200
But I also love the ladies.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.080
Now, I'm pizza blasted, but I'm married,

40:16.080 --> 40:18.800
so it doesn't matter anymore for me.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.080
What if you're a real flavor blasted

40:22.080 --> 40:25.360
and you wear a belly shirt that just says, I'm straight.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.640
But it says, but the straight has been torn off.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.560
Here's the problem.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.200
If you're a great, cool, gay person

40:33.200 --> 40:34.560
with a really funny sense of humor,

40:35.120 --> 40:36.560
a belly shirt that says I'm straight

40:36.560 --> 40:38.240
would probably be the funniest thing you've ever seen.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.760
Probably the funniest thing I've ever seen.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.120
Like they would just run past you, get it?

40:45.920 --> 40:46.400
You got me.

40:46.400 --> 40:46.880
Do you see?

40:46.880 --> 40:47.360
Do you see?

40:50.480 --> 40:51.520
That would be funny.

40:51.520 --> 40:55.040
Gay people of America, start getting a little crazy.

40:55.040 --> 40:55.600
We're ready.

40:56.160 --> 40:56.960
I'm ready for it.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.560
I'm ready to embrace you.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.320
Listen, it's gotten to a point now where you won gay marriage

41:02.320 --> 41:02.880
in New York.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.200
You've proven to everyone that you can be polite,

41:05.200 --> 41:06.640
wonderful members of society.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.400
Now fucking flip it.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.400
Now fucking flip that script.

41:10.400 --> 41:10.640
Yeah.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.800
I want you back to like 1992, 1993 gay.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.640
Those were the gays when you could just,

41:18.640 --> 41:20.720
oh, you just defiled our expectations.

41:21.920 --> 41:22.800
Those were the gays.

41:22.800 --> 41:28.640
Oh man, I want like, I want like Jeffrey too, okay?

41:28.640 --> 41:31.360
I want, I want like-

41:31.360 --> 41:33.840
Those were the gays.

41:36.480 --> 41:39.040
I miss, they're too mainstream now.

41:39.040 --> 41:39.440
Yeah.

41:41.760 --> 41:46.560
The correct answer, by the way, is you can't cut a belly shirt neatly.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.520
You have to just have it made half a shirt

41:49.520 --> 41:52.720
and then they stop halfway down the torso.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.560
It's really the loss of craftsmanship.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.880
I learned that from Jesse Thorne on the belly shirt,

41:56.880 --> 41:57.840
put this on episode.

41:59.040 --> 41:59.760
That was a great one.

41:59.760 --> 42:00.560
Did you catch that one?

42:00.560 --> 42:03.760
I thought that, I thought Alyssa Gore did a great editing job on those.

42:03.760 --> 42:07.040
Got really some nice tight shots on people's guts.

42:07.040 --> 42:11.120
I thought the belly jumpsuit he wore was a bit much, but-

42:11.760 --> 42:15.120
Yeah, I didn't know that you could have a tweed belly shirt either,

42:15.120 --> 42:17.040
but it doesn't seem comfortable.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.040
Yeah, it's making it work though.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.000
Yeah, it sure was.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.320
Hey, listen, do you think there will ever be a time again

42:22.320 --> 42:27.200
when there aren't weird negative stigmas attached with having a mustache

42:27.200 --> 42:31.440
or is this just my burden to bear as a dude with a stash in the 21st century?

42:31.440 --> 42:34.080
And that is from where of all the good mustaches gone.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.760
What weird-

42:38.560 --> 42:38.960
There is.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.560
You know there is.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.200
You know there is.

42:42.320 --> 42:46.160
He means mustache only, I'm assuming, and not mustache and beard.

42:46.160 --> 42:52.080
Okay, because as a bearded gentleman, I run into only positive stereotypes.

42:52.080 --> 42:52.880
Yeah, sure.

42:52.880 --> 42:57.520
Yeah, I think, here's the thing though, here's the problem with this whole,

42:57.520 --> 43:01.120
the question, this is one of those situations where the answer is within the question.

43:01.920 --> 43:07.200
If, as soon as cool people like yourself retreat and stop wearing the mustache,

43:07.760 --> 43:11.120
the mustache becomes solely pedo territory.

43:11.120 --> 43:16.560
Mm-hmm. You know, it's like you see that ground to weird beards,

43:16.560 --> 43:19.760
and then all of a sudden it's like, oops, we're mustaches.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.200
Only bad people have mustaches.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.360
They came for the mustaches of the cool people, I said nothing.

43:26.480 --> 43:32.400
Then the weird people had mustaches and there was no one left for me to mustache for.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.120
Exactly.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.480
That was really good, Justin.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.040
Thank you.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.080
That was beautiful.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.320
That was Langston Hughes, wasn't it?

43:38.320 --> 43:40.480
I read it off my Starbucks cup just now.

43:40.480 --> 43:45.200
I actually have flipped it.

43:46.480 --> 43:49.680
I have just flipped it from the beginning of this question where I was like,

43:49.680 --> 43:52.400
fuck yeah, mustaches, and now I'm like, maybe don't.

43:52.400 --> 43:56.320
I think that a mustache can be like a red carnation on a blind date

43:56.880 --> 44:01.360
where you can tell who the creepsters are if normies don't wear them anymore.

44:01.360 --> 44:06.720
Like if I get on couchsurfing.org and I do a mustache check,

44:06.720 --> 44:08.480
then I can be like, oh, maybe don't sleep on the couch.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.440
So like if a place has like three out of five mustaches.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.840
No, if a face has one out of a possible one mustache,

44:15.840 --> 44:18.080
then that's a sign that maybe I shouldn't stay there.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.000
What if it has more than one?

44:20.560 --> 44:21.360
Oh, God.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.320
Holy shit.

44:22.320 --> 44:26.320
Well, eyebrows are basically mustaches for your eyes, for your eye mouths.

44:27.680 --> 44:32.240
I'm gonna go a more active approach and say that as a cool mustache wearer,

44:32.240 --> 44:39.840
it is now your job to travel the world and point out people that should shave their mustaches.

44:40.640 --> 44:41.600
There's the problem.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.760
You're like, I've earned this, you shave it.

44:44.320 --> 44:45.680
Oh, that definitely exists.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.040
There's a hierarchy of mustache.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.200
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

44:49.200 --> 44:52.480
I think that if you have a glorious full-bodied mustache

44:52.480 --> 44:56.000
and you see somebody with that sketchy stender stash that's not quite filled out.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.080
Stender stash, I would say, is the bottom of the barrel.

44:58.080 --> 45:01.760
I would say the top of the barrel is like a John Hodgeman, like a John Hodgeman.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.800
Like a like a like a glorious stash.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.080
He's making that work.

45:06.080 --> 45:06.320
Yeah.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.040
Or Sam Elliott.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.480
I've kind of like Sam Elliott.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.440
God, yes.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.240
The prototype.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.640
People say like, why don't you guys have more guests on?

45:16.640 --> 45:20.560
If I could get Sam Elliott's mustache on as a guest, I'd be in a heartbeat.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.360
How about just print up a bunch of business cards, right?

45:23.360 --> 45:27.360
That just have Sam Elliott's picture with a little quote underneath

45:27.360 --> 45:31.680
that says you need to shave your stash from Sam Elliott and you hand them out.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.120
Yeah, like demerits.

45:33.120 --> 45:33.920
Like, hey, yeah.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.320
You guys are acting weird.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.200
You did a bad job.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.000
You guys are acting weirder.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.120
Lose it!

45:39.120 --> 45:39.920
You're gonna shave it.

45:40.800 --> 45:44.160
I thought, very briefly, I was at the pool yesterday

45:44.160 --> 45:50.160
and I didn't like the feeling of the hair on my face and chin being so moist.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.720
And I thought about maybe if a mustache would work for me.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.880
I think about it all the time.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.440
I'm actually thinking about it right now.

45:57.440 --> 45:58.000
I'm thinking about-

45:58.000 --> 45:59.840
I'm stroking my upper lip hair right now.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.680
I was gonna ask you a question.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.800
Do you think it would be possible with your recording set up,

46:04.800 --> 46:08.240
could you shave down to a mustache as we're finishing the show?

46:08.960 --> 46:10.080
Would that be possible?

46:11.440 --> 46:12.320
Probably not.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.680
Because my girlfriend would instantly leave me.

46:17.680 --> 46:18.720
Yeah, we would need it.

46:18.720 --> 46:22.320
Plus, we'd also have to turn it into a full blown multimedia,

46:22.320 --> 46:24.160
social media online experience.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.360
Maybe next time we do a live show, you can go to just a mustache.

46:27.360 --> 46:30.720
Yeah, I think live show mustache, I think I could definitely do that.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.080
All right, you've heard it here, all mustaches.

46:34.080 --> 46:38.240
I can do one, Travis can do one, Justin can borrow one from a horse.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.440
I can draw it on.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.720
Justin can draw it on.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.480
With mascara and a stipple brush.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.320
This is gonna be great.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.280
It's gonna be a good show.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.000
Hey, my boyfriend and I have been dating for around three months,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.640
but we don't have a specific anniversary.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.680
That never struck me as odd,

46:53.680 --> 46:56.560
but some of my girlfriends insisted that it was weird

46:56.560 --> 46:58.640
and that he and I needed to have one.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.920
Is not having an anniversary a slight to romantic traditions,

47:01.920 --> 47:05.040
or should we just make up an arbitrary date to appease my friends?

47:05.040 --> 47:07.040
And that is from Michelle Mittens.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.240
Oh, Michelle Mittens.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.560
Michelle, can you not ballpark it for me?

47:10.560 --> 47:13.200
Like you don't remember if it was hot or cold outside?

47:13.200 --> 47:13.920
She did.

47:13.920 --> 47:14.880
It was three months.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.480
Three months ago, so that would be May?

47:20.000 --> 47:20.500
April?

47:21.040 --> 47:21.840
No, maybe May.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.160
I think we just have to pick one.

47:26.160 --> 47:30.640
Yeah, well, is there not an instigating event?

47:30.640 --> 47:31.680
Can you not remember, like,

47:31.680 --> 47:35.200
I remember we had that like four hour talk

47:35.200 --> 47:37.200
after the Dave Matthews Band concert.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.400
Yeah, what's yours?

47:39.360 --> 47:40.400
What's your favorite?

47:40.400 --> 47:41.440
Mine is Ants Marching.

47:42.560 --> 47:43.760
Oh, mine too.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.320
Dreaming.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.480
Yeah, he said American Baby and he laughed.

47:46.480 --> 47:49.040
He was like, no, nobody's favorite song is American Baby.

47:49.040 --> 47:49.540
Wow.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.400
I don't think it's that big of a deal when you're dating, personally.

47:54.400 --> 47:58.960
I think that, but no, no, no, no, no.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.640
You're wrong and here's why.

48:00.640 --> 48:01.040
Okay.

48:01.040 --> 48:04.560
It's like when you have a learner's permit.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.840
If you can't observe the rules of the road with a learner's permit,

48:07.840 --> 48:09.440
you don't deserve a driver's license.

48:09.440 --> 48:12.080
Travis, that was unusually astute.

48:12.720 --> 48:13.760
Are you on PCP?

48:16.080 --> 48:16.960
I'm unlimited.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.200
Have you been taking the Bradley Cooper pills?

48:20.000 --> 48:20.560
I am.

48:20.560 --> 48:21.840
I'm on the Bradley Cooper pills.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.960
Travis brought some insight from a horse today, I think.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.200
I think that we need to pick one for her.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.040
What's a good date?

48:31.040 --> 48:31.360
What is it?

48:31.360 --> 48:32.320
Go with the first.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.080
Go with like June 1st.

48:34.080 --> 48:34.720
No, fuck that.

48:36.240 --> 48:39.360
We have an opportunity right now, Travis, to create love.

48:39.920 --> 48:40.240
Okay.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.840
What is a good day for love to be on?

48:43.840 --> 48:46.000
She said around three months, right?

48:46.000 --> 48:47.920
So we're going May, right?

48:47.920 --> 48:48.240
May.

48:48.240 --> 48:51.040
Okay, if you're going memorable, what about May 8th?

48:51.040 --> 48:52.640
And then you can remember Mayth.

48:53.360 --> 48:53.680
Mayth.

48:54.640 --> 48:54.880
Mayth.

48:54.880 --> 48:55.840
That's not bad.

48:55.840 --> 48:56.880
What about Cinco de Mayo?

48:56.880 --> 48:57.840
What about Cinco de Mayo?

48:57.840 --> 48:59.040
That's what I was thinking, fucking-

48:59.040 --> 49:00.000
I love it.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.480
Five-five, easy to remember Cinco de Mayo.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.200
It's perfect.

49:03.200 --> 49:06.960
Let's get tequila drunk together and spend some time.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.400
Eat some chimmy burritos.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.360
Watch Love, actually.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.520
That's what you do.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.160
I like this.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.360
Cinco de Mayo.

49:13.360 --> 49:14.480
Yeah, Cinco de Mayo.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.720
And then you can Cinco de Love make.

49:17.600 --> 49:18.320
Ooh.

49:18.320 --> 49:18.560
Yeah.

49:18.560 --> 49:21.360
Yeah, we synced up on Cinco de Mayo.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.920
That's what you tell people and they'll retch a little bit in their mouths.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.280
That's what they'll say.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.240
No, I think you just tell the honest story when people are like,

49:28.240 --> 49:29.280
Oh, what's your anniversary?

49:29.280 --> 49:32.640
Say it's Cinco de Mayo because three random dudes chose it for us.

49:32.640 --> 49:36.320
Three random dudes chose our anniversary.

49:36.320 --> 49:37.680
Yeah, we have a special kind of love.

49:39.840 --> 49:43.680
Three guys spread throughout the country decided when we were in love.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.120
My favorite oral novel.

49:47.120 --> 49:51.760
I wish more people gave us that kind of, I think of us as sort of the global justicars of love.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.760
Like, I wish that people would write us and be like, what day was my baby born?

49:55.760 --> 49:56.160
Yeah.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.440
Hey, I need a new birthday.

49:57.440 --> 49:58.320
What's up?

49:58.320 --> 49:59.680
Who is my real dad?

49:59.680 --> 50:01.120
Hey, Christmas sucks.

50:01.120 --> 50:01.840
Can you move it?

50:03.360 --> 50:03.920
Sure can.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.360
I sure can.

50:05.360 --> 50:06.720
March 12th.

50:07.440 --> 50:08.480
Merry Christmas, everybody.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.560
St. Patrick's Day is coming up soon.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.080
Oh, my advent calendar is wrong.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.760
I need a new one.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.360
Hey, I have a Yahoo.

50:19.360 --> 50:20.720
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Cal.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.280
Thank you, Cal.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Helen of Troy, who asks,

50:26.960 --> 50:28.000
How do people dress?

50:30.000 --> 50:30.800
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.960
It says, how do people dress at spanking parties?

50:37.520 --> 50:39.200
I'm not planning on going to one.

50:41.280 --> 50:43.680
But I am curious as to what they're all about.

50:43.680 --> 50:44.160
Do people-

50:44.160 --> 50:45.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:45.120 --> 50:46.960
Do people dress in role-playing costumes?

50:47.520 --> 50:50.000
Can you just sit there and observe all the spanking around

50:50.000 --> 50:51.200
and you not have to participate?

50:51.760 --> 50:52.640
Good one, Dave.

50:52.640 --> 50:53.440
You really got her.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.840
Not for me to spank you.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.360
Do you have to pay to enter the party?

51:01.360 --> 51:03.200
Are the parties usually at a private residence?

51:03.200 --> 51:04.400
Any answers would be appreciated.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.240
I'm willing to bet that if you go to a spanking party,

51:08.240 --> 51:10.080
you're paying in one way or another.

51:10.080 --> 51:14.240
Yeah, no one rides for free.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.680
Oh, man, what do you-

51:15.680 --> 51:18.480
Ass, ass, or ass, no one rides for free.

51:18.480 --> 51:19.360
Which one?

51:21.680 --> 51:23.360
What is a spanking party?

51:23.360 --> 51:26.320
Yeah, I'm already upset by just the assumption

51:26.320 --> 51:29.120
that this is a real thing that people do

51:29.120 --> 51:32.240
and not something this person has made up.

51:32.240 --> 51:34.480
Yeah, because there's not a five paragraph answer

51:34.480 --> 51:35.360
that somebody's provided.

51:36.000 --> 51:36.800
Oh, fuck.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.440
Oh, oops.

51:37.440 --> 51:40.480
Everybody, I want complete silence.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.280
Griffin, you have to read the whole thing.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.400
Let's see how long we can go.

51:43.680 --> 51:44.160
Oh, man.

51:45.120 --> 51:48.480
This is Baka Otaku 30.

51:49.360 --> 51:49.920
Good start.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.120
Is there some music you can underlay here later

51:53.120 --> 51:54.160
when you're editing together?

51:54.160 --> 51:55.200
Something kind of nice and easy?

51:55.200 --> 51:56.800
Yeah, I'll throw down some Norah Jones.

51:56.800 --> 51:59.120
Yeah, that would be great, actually.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.960
Having been to my fair share of spanking parties,

52:02.960 --> 52:03.920
I'll happily answer this.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.400
Though more information can be found in an essay

52:06.400 --> 52:08.160
that I posted on my spanking blog months ago.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.480
The link to my blog can be found on my profile,

52:10.480 --> 52:12.640
though it'll take some digging to find the correct entry.

52:12.640 --> 52:16.080
Unless a party has a specific theme like teacher-student,

52:16.080 --> 52:17.680
most people will simply wear clothes

52:17.680 --> 52:19.120
that are comfortable and casual.

52:19.120 --> 52:21.040
Spankers may tend to wear clothes

52:21.040 --> 52:23.120
that are more formal or authoritative.

52:23.120 --> 52:24.080
And spankies...

52:24.080 --> 52:39.120
And spankies leans towards clothes

52:39.120 --> 52:40.720
that are loose-fitting or easily removed,

52:40.720 --> 52:43.120
allowing faster access to bare their bottom.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.320
Skirts are common among female spankies,

52:48.320 --> 52:50.800
with pleated schoolgirl skirts being the most common.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.200
Some people will dress in roleplay, though,

52:53.200 --> 52:55.360
and there are some parties devoted entirely to roleplay.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.000
Yes, you may sit and observe if you don't feel like playing.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.720
No one is forced to play,

53:00.720 --> 53:03.040
and many parties have the attendees wear stickers

53:03.040 --> 53:06.160
that show the orientation for their night,

53:06.160 --> 53:07.600
top, bottom, or switch.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.640
I just threw a can across the room because I was so like,

53:12.640 --> 53:14.160
yes, I gave blood today.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.320
That's a crazy sticker.

53:16.320 --> 53:18.800
And include a designation for observer or newbie.

53:20.400 --> 53:22.080
Oh, as Phil pointed out,

53:22.080 --> 53:24.080
you may be encouraged to play, but most people won't be pushy.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.680
If you're new, the best parties will give a new person

53:25.680 --> 53:27.520
a chance to feel comfortable before they start playing.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.640
Most parties do have an entrance fee,

53:30.640 --> 53:32.480
or at least ask for a donation to cover costs,

53:32.480 --> 53:34.160
or that the attendees bring a...

53:34.160 --> 53:34.960
What costs?

53:34.960 --> 53:36.320
Or that the attendees bring a...

53:36.320 --> 53:37.680
The aloe vera?

53:37.680 --> 53:40.480
Or that the attendees bring a covered dish to share.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.040
Who brought the fried kale?

53:43.040 --> 53:43.600
This is...

53:43.600 --> 53:44.000
Ow!

53:44.000 --> 53:44.480
Fuck!

53:44.480 --> 53:44.800
Ow!

53:45.680 --> 53:46.720
Not yet, Steve!

53:46.720 --> 53:47.680
Jesus fuck!

53:47.680 --> 53:48.800
Look at my sticker!

53:49.520 --> 53:50.560
I'm an observer!

53:50.560 --> 53:51.680
Check my sticker!

53:51.680 --> 53:52.240
Jesus!

53:53.520 --> 53:55.760
I'm the caterer to this spank party!

53:56.800 --> 53:58.080
God damn!

53:58.080 --> 54:01.120
I'm clearly dressed in a more authoritative manner.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.640
I am the swanger!

54:02.640 --> 54:04.400
I like to wear a trench coat to the parties

54:04.400 --> 54:06.000
and tell them that I'm the covered dish.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.360
The best parties also offer the most

54:11.360 --> 54:12.400
for the least amount of cash.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.520
From what I've heard,

54:13.520 --> 54:16.160
Shadow Lane costs far too much for what is available.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.000
And I went to a Crimson Moon party

54:18.000 --> 54:20.160
and can say that the same is true for all of them.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.760
Crimson Moon, fuck you!

54:21.760 --> 54:22.960
Fuck you, that's made up.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.400
The most bang for the buck-

54:24.400 --> 54:25.200
Oh, this is promising.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.200
The most bang for the buck, from my experience,

54:27.200 --> 54:29.600
is the Texas All-State Spanking Party,

54:29.600 --> 54:31.200
as their entrance fees are always low,

54:31.200 --> 54:32.240
yet the party is huge,

54:32.240 --> 54:34.640
particularly the years that it takes place in Dallas.

54:34.640 --> 54:35.680
Road trip.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.840
Griffin must go.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.760
I'm gonna shave down to a mustache.

54:39.760 --> 54:41.520
I'm gonna fucking show up to that.

54:42.800 --> 54:43.760
Oh, God.

54:43.760 --> 54:45.440
Uh, larger parties take place in hotels and resorts.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.120
Smaller parties usually at private residences.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.200
I enjoy the seclusion of a cabin party.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.400
There's something alluring to me at the public nature of a hotel party.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.240
No shit, you fucking-

54:52.240 --> 54:53.840
Okay, straight up.

54:53.840 --> 54:57.280
You guys gave shit to the people on couchsurfing.org.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.000
This is the new terrifying.

55:00.000 --> 55:00.880
Hey, uh, listen.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.320
As long as you're staying with me tonight,

55:02.320 --> 55:04.080
uh, you'll feel your win in Rome, you know?

55:04.080 --> 55:06.160
Uh, I got some friends coming overnight.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.760
Uh, uh, choose your sticker.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.840
Stand into the- get in the spankatorium.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.040
Choose wisely.

55:11.920 --> 55:14.560
Stand in the spank tank with your sticker.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.080
Welcome to the spankatorium.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.320
You can sleep on the couch if you'd like,

55:18.320 --> 55:19.600
but we might be keeping you up.

55:19.600 --> 55:22.000
We might keep you up if you sleep too close to the spank dome.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.000
Uh, last thing.

55:24.000 --> 55:24.720
Team mate enter.

55:25.440 --> 55:26.400
One man leaves.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.920
One more thing, and this is the most upsetting part.

55:27.920 --> 55:31.520
There are also icebreaker games to get everyone comfortable when a party starts,

55:31.520 --> 55:33.040
so spanking can begin.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.360
Uh, demos, vendors, contests, and special events.

55:36.320 --> 55:37.360
Hey, guys.

55:37.360 --> 55:37.600
Hey.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.640
Just really quick.

55:38.640 --> 55:44.880
Um, I mean, I get, um, like, what's the- what's the-

55:44.880 --> 55:48.800
does it go trust falls, then low ropes activities,

55:48.800 --> 55:50.880
and then you fucking punish someone?

55:50.880 --> 55:52.080
Just punish that ass.

55:53.120 --> 55:55.760
What's the core- what is the- explain to me.

55:55.760 --> 55:57.040
You played the minister's cat.

55:57.040 --> 56:00.560
It's- no, it's name game, keep the balls in the air,

56:01.120 --> 56:02.960
and then paddle till bloody chunks.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.800
Just fucking wail on that ass.

56:06.800 --> 56:10.240
Punish that student, and then you go back to low ropes.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.800
Is it light as a feather, stiff as a board,

56:12.800 --> 56:14.640
and then cat of nine tails?

56:14.640 --> 56:14.880
Yeah.

56:15.520 --> 56:16.720
I can never remember.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.720
See, I like to use spanking to break the ice

56:18.720 --> 56:19.920
before I do something uncomfortable.

56:19.920 --> 56:20.960
Like, hey, I'm Justin.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.240
Low ropes are this way.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.440
Ask to borrow money or something.

56:23.440 --> 56:24.320
You want some Sprite?

56:26.000 --> 56:27.920
My favorite thing, and it goes all the way back

56:27.920 --> 56:30.720
to the beginning of the explanation, is the line, um,

56:31.280 --> 56:34.080
because of, uh, I've gone to a bunch of spanking parties,

56:34.640 --> 56:35.840
I'll handle this one.

56:35.840 --> 56:38.560
Like, everybody was rushing to answer, and they're like,

56:38.560 --> 56:39.600
I got this, I got this.

56:39.600 --> 56:40.480
I got this.

56:40.480 --> 56:40.880
Don't worry.

56:40.880 --> 56:41.360
I got it.

56:41.360 --> 56:41.920
Allow me.

56:41.920 --> 56:42.240
I consider myself-

56:42.240 --> 56:43.840
You come to the right place.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.200
We're cool. We're cool.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.520
I have a master sticker, so, you know,

56:48.080 --> 56:49.760
you know that I know what I'm talking about.

56:49.760 --> 56:50.800
Oh, you brought casserole.

56:50.800 --> 56:51.360
That's nice.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.040
How excited must this guy have been

56:55.040 --> 56:58.480
to be combing the weird party section of Yahoo Answers,

56:58.480 --> 57:03.040
and fucking finally, someone is ready to tap into his expertise?

57:05.200 --> 57:06.640
The punishment part, no.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.080
Master student, no, no, no.

57:08.720 --> 57:12.000
Poop eating, have to, no, no, no.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.840
Ah, here we go.

57:13.840 --> 57:14.880
A spanking question.

57:17.920 --> 57:18.800
This question, by the way,

57:18.800 --> 57:21.040
I just realized was from four years ago,

57:21.040 --> 57:22.080
so if we're lucky-

57:22.960 --> 57:23.920
This person's dead.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.120
That everyone is dead.

57:25.120 --> 57:25.920
Spank to death.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.600
Spank to- Oh, you spanked my guts out!

57:31.600 --> 57:32.100
No!

57:33.440 --> 57:37.440
You know, you guys understand how this little short story ends, right?

57:37.440 --> 57:39.440
It ends with, sometime this week,

57:39.440 --> 57:42.960
we get an email from someone whose butt hurt for giving an expression.

57:45.520 --> 57:46.160
Hey, listen.

57:47.440 --> 57:50.560
Me and my spouse-

57:50.560 --> 57:52.000
Me and my fellow cheek blasters,

57:52.000 --> 57:53.360
we didn't like those things you said.

57:55.280 --> 57:57.840
Listen, me and the other rump wrestlers were talking.

58:00.960 --> 58:03.200
It's, listen, tough shit, okay?

58:03.200 --> 58:04.400
Everybody does weird things.

58:04.400 --> 58:06.160
Keep it secret, keep it safe.

58:06.160 --> 58:10.080
Part of it, part of it, part of the weird shit

58:10.080 --> 58:12.400
is not getting uppity when other people call you on it,

58:12.400 --> 58:15.280
because it's a secret, so you're not supposed to admit to it.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.240
That's what secrets are.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.960
And listen, no one can possibly use the phrase,

58:18.960 --> 58:20.480
no, no, I do this all the time.

58:20.480 --> 58:22.320
There's nothing weird about it.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.680
Fuck you.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.640
By the way, scoop for you,

58:26.640 --> 58:27.920
if there was nothing weird about it,

58:27.920 --> 58:31.120
you wouldn't prefer cabin parties, you weirdo.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.760
I like Tupperware parties in the middle of fucking nowhere

58:35.760 --> 58:37.600
where I know the sheriff's not gonna come

58:37.600 --> 58:40.240
putting his big nose into my business.

58:40.800 --> 58:41.920
Unless he's into that.

58:41.920 --> 58:43.040
Unless he's into that.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.800
He's more than welcome, obviously.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.480
All are welcome.

58:46.480 --> 58:48.080
All are welcome at the spank party.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.280
I will say that if the rest of the world

58:51.280 --> 58:54.160
could take on the open-mindedness of a spank party,

58:54.160 --> 58:56.000
maybe we'd be a little bit of a better place.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.080
Yeah, or the worst place ever.

58:58.080 --> 59:01.120
Or the worst place ever, and no one could sit down.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.040
Just a chairless wasteland.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.040
Let's see.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.800
Listen, I wanna hear Griffin's last question.

59:07.760 --> 59:09.600
But first, just a few housekeeping things.

59:09.600 --> 59:14.800
Next week, we are gonna have a special back-to-school episode.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.320
All our questions, everything's gonna be about

59:16.320 --> 59:17.440
headed back to school.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.120
About the movie Back to School.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.400
Yeah, about the movie Back to School,

59:20.400 --> 59:23.040
about actually physically going,

59:23.040 --> 59:25.840
what's cool for kids, what styles are cool this year.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.600
But that's gonna be up to you.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.080
You need to send us all your back-to-school questions,

59:30.080 --> 59:34.320
you know, from college to kindergarten.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.360
Here's the sneak preview.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.760
Five star, out.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.560
Mead, in.

59:39.600 --> 59:40.000
Yeah.

59:40.000 --> 59:40.800
Trapper keeper.

59:41.360 --> 59:41.920
Donezo.

59:43.760 --> 59:45.040
Please, if you get a chance this week,

59:45.040 --> 59:46.320
can you just tell a friend, say,

59:46.320 --> 59:48.720
hey, I made you a CD, it's got the show on it.

59:48.720 --> 59:51.840
Or, and hey, this is a super-duper please.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.760
I see a lot of people ask people on Twitter,

59:53.760 --> 59:54.720
like, hey, what's with Bim Bam?

59:54.720 --> 59:55.840
Because you just talked about it.

59:55.840 --> 59:56.720
Will you answer them?

59:56.720 --> 59:59.040
Can you please send them a link to our sampler,

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.400
so that way they listen to it?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.080
It's bit.ly forward slash it's Bim Bam.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.360
And if they hear that, they think,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.320
oh, this is funny.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.520
It's an easy way to get people into it.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.840
Or just search YouTube for Bim Bam.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.440
It's like the first thing that comes up.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.880
Yeah, and also, while they're on there,

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.240
make sure that they check out the rinse and repeat.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.840
The Saturday morning concert?

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.440
Yeah, they're gonna love that.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.320
Yeah, it's good stuff.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.360
Thank you to John Roderick in the long winters

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.880
for the use of our theme song, Into Departure,

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.800
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which is-

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.160
Speaking of spanking parties.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.000
Oh, man, just turn that one on, and your next-

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.840
What I love is, somebody tweeted,

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.600
thanks, NBNBAM, and long winters, the album is great.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.680
John Roderick retreated it.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.480
He was super happy that it was up there.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.920
And he retreated it.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.400
He capitulated.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.360
He did retreat it.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.160
Hey, you know.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.600
Travis had a big spanking last night.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.120
I think that we should stop advising people

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.280
to just buy Putting the Days to Bed.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.800
I think you should buy every long winters album.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.200
Oh, yeah.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:55.600
They're all-

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.160
Want to pretend to fall?

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:56.720
They're literally all great.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.680
God damn, it's so good.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.280
We've got a forum.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.080
It's maximumfun.org forward slash something, something, something.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.440
But if you go to maximumfun.org, there's a forums button there.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.720
And we're there.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.400
We talk with people.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.920
Talk about the episode.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.440
Talk about what you liked, what you didn't like.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.280
Feedback, you know.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.160
Real dialogue.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.400
And of course, you can do that on Twitter, too.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.920
Just use the NBNBAM hashtag when you talk about something related to the show,

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.440
be it a quote or something like that.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.480
Not only the best place to ask us questions for the show,

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.560
for that, you want to go with NBNBAM at maximumfun.org.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.880
But we're happy to answer them there.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.720
And yeah.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.240
Thank you, everybody.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.760
Thanks, everybody.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.240
I love you.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.960
Griffin is going to give us one more question,

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.640
something to sort of think about over the oncoming week.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.920
So Griffin, take it away.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.440
This one was sent in by Greg Jaxes.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.320
Thanks, Greg.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, LordHaveMercy, who asks,

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.000
Why would a six-foot-three man who looks like Jay-Z

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.520
be a lot more depressed than a five-foot-six guy who looks like Jay-Z?

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.600
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.720
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.680
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.640
This is my dad.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.920
This is what we wear on the lips.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.600
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.120
Keep your heart, ay.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.720
Keep your heart, three stacks.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.240
Keep your heart, man.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.840
These girls are smart, three stacks.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.240
These girls are smart.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:52.720
Play your part.
