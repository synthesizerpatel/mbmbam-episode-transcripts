WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.060
baby have you ever wondered wondered whatever became of me I'm living on the

00:10.060 --> 00:18.000
air in Cincinnati Cincinnati WKRP come on everybody

00:18.000 --> 00:24.960
got kind of tired of packing and unpacking town to town up and down the

00:24.960 --> 00:30.120
dial maybe you and me were never meant to be but maybe think of me once or

00:30.120 --> 00:48.640
while I'm on WKRP in the McElroy brothers are not experts I used up all

00:48.640 --> 00:52.640
my time singing and their advice should never be followed

00:52.640 --> 00:59.880
Travis claims he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his wall I haven't

00:59.880 --> 01:06.640
seen it also this show isn't for kids so all you babies out there know how cool

01:06.640 --> 01:35.360
you are for listening what's up you cool baby

01:35.360 --> 01:50.720
hey my town cool start hello everybody welcome my brother my brother to me and

01:50.720 --> 01:58.960
if I show for the modern era I'm your oldest brother just I'm your hometown

01:58.960 --> 02:06.840
hero and middle is brother Travis McElroy and I'm your sweet baby brother

02:06.840 --> 02:10.800
and 30 under 30 media luminary who famously moved away from this city

02:10.800 --> 02:18.720
Griffin McElroy it doesn't matter they don't they don't give a shit trash okay

02:18.720 --> 02:24.240
the streets you drive on I paid for those streets by the way I apologize for

02:24.240 --> 02:27.880
the fact that our dad forgot that our audience is collectively 15 years old

02:27.880 --> 02:32.960
and doesn't know what the fuck WKRP you did help me win a bet though yeah

02:32.960 --> 02:42.880
appreciate that did tell dad wouldn't fly that bird it is laying I like that

02:42.880 --> 02:48.960
you I do appreciate that many of you it seemed took a kind of tootless guess at

02:48.960 --> 03:03.840
how the song ended Cincinnati that'll help keep our dad warm tonight local boy

03:03.840 --> 03:11.400
made bad yeah hey bad news immediately before we came on stage right before our

03:11.400 --> 03:17.360
dad just fucking bombed so hard you know I cut the intro from every I'm gonna

03:17.360 --> 03:24.360
leave that one in okay you know I'm assuming if you don't half of this show

03:24.360 --> 03:30.840
won't make sense right you know Hollywood Knights by Bob Seger was

03:30.840 --> 03:34.720
playing so I was doing a bit of a dance backstage to sort of get ready and

03:34.720 --> 03:40.760
involved a sort of like a Ukrainian folk dance spinning maneuver Griff we're

03:40.760 --> 03:44.240
actually in like a visual medium right now do you think we get just this quick

03:44.240 --> 03:50.040
sample Paul Paul if you can help us out with a little bit of Hollywood Knight

03:50.040 --> 03:53.440
this probably won't make it well the odd cast but okay this was gonna end in how

03:53.440 --> 04:00.760
bad the dance was for me physically as a person but I guess I could kind of a

04:00.760 --> 04:18.240
spin so it was a lot like that are you okay here's the problem how's your

04:18.240 --> 04:25.640
bottom we'll cut this backstage I got dizzy and sick just now my butthole

04:25.640 --> 04:33.760
exploded so this is gonna be a 15 minute long episode because that's how long

04:33.760 --> 04:43.040
it'll take for an ambulance to get here I had the realization my spine

04:43.040 --> 04:47.960
telescoped on stage while I was failing to do a Ukrainian folk dance to Bob

04:47.960 --> 04:56.200
Seger so that's the worst moment of my life I had that realization backstage I

04:56.200 --> 05:00.600
want to be 40 this year pretty soon this entire pre-show playlist is gonna be Bob

05:00.600 --> 05:05.720
Seger yeah it's just gonna slowly evolve statistically speaking eventually and I

05:05.720 --> 05:11.680
cannot wait so yes Cincinnati like the Chilean miners before us we have

05:11.680 --> 05:17.440
reemerged here in Cincinnati this is where they came out they dug a

05:17.440 --> 05:25.000
sideways hole way more work than they needed to work but they love those

05:25.000 --> 05:31.360
hard-hitting redlegs so they they came out here in Cincinnati so okay this is

05:31.360 --> 05:33.760
an advice show where we take your questions and turn them out could be

05:33.760 --> 05:37.120
like into wisdom we're gonna do that for you many of you sit in questions we do

05:37.120 --> 05:49.440
appreciate you hold on Travis is all this peacocking backstage all this my

05:49.440 --> 05:54.080
town bullshit means we're gonna get all that we're gonna get all the fucking

05:54.080 --> 06:04.520
Travis segments tonight not all of them and this was set in by Scott McFall and

06:04.520 --> 06:10.440
Scott actually send this in weeks ago and I stumbled across it and found it so

06:10.440 --> 06:15.480
delicious I saved it from my town okay so it's been fermenting and going rancid

06:15.480 --> 06:24.320
and rancid guys hey dudes my butt hurts a lot that's the new pin of the month

06:24.320 --> 06:38.280
okay okay I like any this riddle begins with so so this man is in a slump and he

06:38.280 --> 06:45.840
is in a boat and he's about to fall out he is not wearing a lifejacket so he

06:45.840 --> 06:54.640
grabbed something hairy so he does not fall out what did he grab do you need me

06:54.640 --> 06:59.000
to read it again I wish you wouldn't but I said you're going to anyway this man

06:59.000 --> 07:05.480
is in a swarm could set my watch yeah and he is in a boat and he is about to

07:05.480 --> 07:10.720
fall out he is not wearing a lifejacket so he grabbed something hairy so he does

07:10.720 --> 07:14.680
not fall out what did he grab now while Justin and Griffin pondered this one for

07:14.680 --> 07:19.520
those of you have never heard riddle me pissed welcome this is a quiet this was

07:19.520 --> 07:22.960
a riddle submitted to the website riddles calm and somebody submitted this

07:22.960 --> 07:29.440
inside this is a great riddle that other people need to consume your gas Griffin

07:29.440 --> 07:37.400
now you're you're googling no I'm gonna say his best friend who is also in the

07:37.400 --> 07:42.520
boat with him I'm gonna say cousin it from the Addams family what did he grab

07:42.520 --> 07:48.080
why a bobcat's tail and I'm going to read it I'm going to read this verbatim

07:48.080 --> 07:53.280
wait why what I'm going to read this are they telling a story like about their

07:53.280 --> 07:59.440
dad I'm going to read this verbatim a bobcat's tail the bobcat is in a tree

07:59.440 --> 08:03.920
PS I hope it does not eat him

08:03.920 --> 08:13.640
that is among the dumbest shit I've ever even to grant this person the fiction

08:13.640 --> 08:20.560
this guy's about to fall in the swamp uh-huh and he's like I've got a plan I'm

08:20.560 --> 08:26.800
going to hold on to a cat above me uh-huh and not fall out of the boat what

08:26.800 --> 08:30.720
this would presuppose is that if you grabbed a bobcat bobcat's tail the

08:30.720 --> 08:36.000
bobcat would retain its grip on the tree enough that you could hang from the

08:36.000 --> 08:40.240
bobcats a lot of things are gonna have to go exactly right for this bobcat to

08:40.240 --> 08:47.400
be like I got you Ricky remember that time you saved my life that bobcat has

08:47.400 --> 08:51.400
like been doing pull-ups every day it's like it's like the end of signs the

08:51.400 --> 08:58.400
bobcats like it's all about this saving Ricky Justin my roommate is not a

08:58.400 --> 09:08.200
woodworker and yet he has taken it upon himself to do work on our wood furniture

09:08.200 --> 09:16.400
specifically our dining room table now has rounded and at best rustic corners

09:17.800 --> 09:22.400
rustic interchangeably with shitty

09:22.960 --> 09:27.200
thanks to his efforts other plans and don't put your elbows on the table no

09:27.200 --> 09:31.640
really please don't you will get hurt other plans include building a shelving

09:31.640 --> 09:36.520
unit above his already wobbly IKEA bed and cutting the couch in half to make

09:36.520 --> 09:46.080
two chairs on the one hand I want to be a good friend a feeling that is not

09:46.080 --> 09:52.960
reciprocated and support his new interest and hobby on the other hand I

09:52.960 --> 09:58.200
like my furniture without saw marks brothers how can I encourage my roommate

09:58.200 --> 10:02.560
to broaden his carpentry horizons without sacrificing any more furniture

10:02.560 --> 10:10.640
that's from concerning Columbus are you here that was that was actually the

10:10.640 --> 10:15.800
sound of them falling out of the chair that their roommate I think I think

10:15.800 --> 10:22.560
referring to a couch that has been cut the fuck in half as having quote saw

10:22.560 --> 10:29.360
marks on it is being incredibly generous to your roommate I what you should do is

10:29.360 --> 10:35.320
get your roommate just like I like a foot of two by four and ask them to

10:35.320 --> 10:38.720
start sawing through it because if they're anything like me they'll make

10:38.720 --> 10:45.160
it two inches in and back oh wait this this is hard I want to get into a bit of

10:45.160 --> 10:50.840
a semantic issue here you say your roommate is not a woodworker but I have

10:50.840 --> 10:58.400
news for you they don't they don't cut your couch in half so I'm gonna go

10:58.400 --> 11:06.600
ahead and argue they are a woodwork now quality I can't speak to that but you

11:06.600 --> 11:11.840
can't deny you've begun they've begun working yeah with wood sure so by that

11:11.840 --> 11:16.640
logic Justin everyone's a bad doctor

11:16.640 --> 11:24.680
explain I could cut an arm off no no no no okay but you don't yeah but I but if

11:24.680 --> 11:33.600
I did you went back you're the lowest rung on dr. ladder yeah but if I throw a

11:33.600 --> 11:44.600
knife at a cow I'm not a butcher yeah okay but I'm assuming they put arms back

11:44.600 --> 11:49.280
on the couch halves to make chairs right assuming a lot yeah it's being very

11:49.280 --> 11:55.760
again in this fiction you have sewn another different arm onto your friend

11:55.760 --> 12:01.640
and I guess to continue the metaphor shown two arms on yeah to just make him

12:01.640 --> 12:06.200
a little more kick-ass like a cool three-armed friend right I cut my friend

12:06.200 --> 12:10.880
and have to have two friends yeah I know that what now that would be a butcher I

12:10.880 --> 12:15.760
would love to get an Excel spreadsheet from your roommate of how all of the

12:15.760 --> 12:21.480
furniture math in the world breaks down for example half a couch as we all know

12:21.480 --> 12:27.920
is two chairs what half a chair half a chair now we're talking about four

12:27.920 --> 12:35.200
Ottomans half an Ottoman maybe it's a tiny stool for an infant right each in

12:35.200 --> 12:44.600
each infant stool is 12 coasters I I liked my favorite detail on the question

12:44.600 --> 12:50.080
is the wobbly IKEA bed because they couldn't even do that shit right yeah

12:50.080 --> 12:55.840
hey how about a Yahoo from the Yahoo Answers service yes please

12:55.840 --> 13:02.160
Emma can't sent this in thank you Emma can't are you here oh okay yeah what's

13:02.160 --> 13:09.320
not to like it's by Yahoo Answers user lowdown who asks how to recover from a

13:09.320 --> 13:16.220
horrible sacks performance first of all it happens to everyone and it's totally

13:16.220 --> 13:23.040
normal Oh sacks yeah do you hey quick question do you feel good about that

13:23.040 --> 13:30.600
joke not right now but I will later when I tell myself everyone laughs okay you

13:30.600 --> 13:42.280
and you and dad can have a cool I think I broke my wrist I had a performance

13:42.280 --> 13:52.200
tonight which for me went bad I tried to do a Ukrainian folk dance I hit some

13:52.200 --> 13:56.800
notes without really resolving them and had some fumbles while playing does that

13:56.800 --> 14:00.760
mean you drop the sacks yeah the other team picked it up started playing

14:00.760 --> 14:11.920
competing jazz people said it sounded good but in my soul I know better that's

14:11.920 --> 14:17.440
gonna be the one that keeps me out of heaven yeah how do I go from here

14:17.440 --> 14:21.640
because my performances have gone down and now I think I might not be asked to

14:21.640 --> 14:25.080
play again next year thanks in advance oh I'll see you got sad at the end it

14:25.080 --> 14:29.720
got saying you're all in your head you need an easy one they need to set

14:29.720 --> 14:33.200
yourself up with someone who's like never heard what's up it looks like you

14:33.200 --> 14:37.760
need to fucking like headline the next Bonnar and be like what's up guys who's

14:37.760 --> 14:40.960
ready for hot cross

14:42.400 --> 14:50.520
but it's not actually poppin I'm so bad at this instrument but it sounds like

14:50.520 --> 14:57.280
they were doing good before this one well they have been going down that's

14:57.280 --> 15:01.800
what I'm saying going down since then all in their head yeah so what do you

15:01.800 --> 15:05.160
suggest are you just pointing out the question that they already know it's

15:05.160 --> 15:08.160
just that they need something to get their groove back one thing you could do

15:08.160 --> 15:14.880
if you realize a sax performance is going poorly this is what I do hmm is

15:14.880 --> 15:22.040
you announce I'm gonna do a really cool one now this is the one I wrote but only

15:22.040 --> 15:29.160
super smart people can hear it and then you just stop blowing and do stuff with

15:29.160 --> 15:35.200
your fingers yeah and everybody's like yeah this is good and they're all

15:35.200 --> 15:39.600
looking around like I don't want everybody to know I can't hear it mmm

15:39.600 --> 15:43.080
because only really smart people can appreciate it which now that I say that

15:43.080 --> 15:49.840
out loud is the conceit of jazz writ large only smart people can hear this

15:49.840 --> 15:53.280
always smart people can it I don't want to let everybody else know I'm not

15:53.280 --> 15:58.480
smart yeah I like this mmm I like all the notes they don't play yeah this is

15:58.480 --> 16:02.440
good you know that is not actually that dissimilar from how I got through middle

16:02.440 --> 16:10.160
school band which was just by putting my trombone up to my lips and moving my arm

16:10.160 --> 16:13.600
wild from both the easiest instrument to fake because nobody's gonna see

16:13.600 --> 16:19.160
somebody going like I'd be like they would not work that hard unless they

16:19.160 --> 16:22.960
were fucking shredding right now

16:23.400 --> 16:27.320
you could also if you feel you're losing the audience while you're doing a

16:27.320 --> 16:31.480
saxophone performance just step in front of everyone else and start going bum bum

16:31.480 --> 16:37.120
bum bum bum bum bum singing it cuz you don't know how to play this right yeah

16:37.120 --> 16:41.400
if you just start vocalizing you can call me Al that will go so good for you

16:41.400 --> 16:45.280
I bet they'll talk about that's a viral video right there now you're famous oh

16:45.280 --> 16:48.640
sure there's a lot of stuff you could do on the stage to go viral while you're

16:48.640 --> 16:53.480
playing a saxophone Travis you get three try and eat the saxophone try and

16:53.480 --> 16:58.600
make someone else eat the saxophone pretend like the saxophone is a penis

16:58.600 --> 17:02.480
pretend the saxophone is a penis is very good Travis see you didn't even need to

17:02.480 --> 17:08.000
think very hard to land on that one say hey everybody I'm gonna see how far I

17:08.000 --> 17:11.840
can stick my arm up the wrong end of the saxophone and then you have to wait for

17:11.840 --> 17:16.820
the cops to come and get your arm out of the saxophone that's funny how was the

17:16.820 --> 17:20.700
jazz concert last night it's all about the notes they didn't play because a

17:20.700 --> 17:25.960
man got his arm stuck in his own baritone saxophone to the fucking elbow

17:25.960 --> 17:35.480
somebody else came up and cut it off and yelled I'm a doctor at the end he was

17:35.480 --> 17:39.540
doing a tight solo and shot his own severed arm into the audience I will

17:39.540 --> 17:49.760
never forget it he got 200 but it's hard to compete with all the let's plays

17:49.760 --> 17:53.720
these days if only he had cut his arm off and hidden it inside a surprise egg

17:53.720 --> 18:03.720
or some shit in our high school's local theater I've been looking for a way to

18:03.720 --> 18:09.080
set myself apart as more than just the guy okay yeah it's all right I just

18:09.080 --> 18:13.080
don't I couldn't figure out why they called the cops

18:13.080 --> 18:23.200
I want the people to call the last person you would call but it's a crime

18:23.200 --> 18:29.960
against music this is okay I mean your fire department does the cat stuff okay

18:29.960 --> 18:33.200
in my defense what the fuck's the fire the fire department's not gonna be like

18:33.200 --> 18:36.340
oh it's good you called the fire department we're the only ones who a

18:36.340 --> 18:46.080
saxophone grease wait is it a baritone saxophone fuck we got nothing for you

18:46.080 --> 18:50.720
you should have called the cops you're gonna call the National Guard yeah I

18:50.720 --> 18:58.680
mean no one is especially well this imaginary situation I grant you in our

18:58.680 --> 19:02.560
high school's local theater I've been looking for a way to set myself apart as

19:02.560 --> 19:07.120
more than just the guy who does lights I think we've stumbled on one already

19:07.120 --> 19:12.920
pretty pretty definitively yeah while also trying to deal with the crushing

19:12.920 --> 19:19.080
anxiety way of being on stage how do I set myself apart from the rest of these

19:19.080 --> 19:23.840
theater kids and really stand out that's from thespian and cincinnati are you

19:23.840 --> 19:29.600
here see that's a good start yeah that's well you just do that from the

19:29.600 --> 19:33.680
lighting grid during shows he just screamed in front of 2,000 or so your

19:33.680 --> 19:39.560
closest friends that's great oh no it's that hooting phantom again have you

19:39.560 --> 19:43.120
thought about phantoming maybe phantoming is the way to go

19:43.120 --> 19:48.000
everyone talks about the phantom yeah you're gonna have to kill some folks

19:48.000 --> 19:52.320
well okay hold on I think when people talk about the phantom they're talking

19:52.320 --> 19:58.680
about the great songs the delectable costumes I don't think they're talking

19:58.680 --> 20:03.400
about like famous ghost murderer the phantom I love the shit he did I feel

20:03.400 --> 20:07.600
like that's the way he gets things done right cuz otherwise he's just a dude who

20:07.600 --> 20:12.840
these weird notes you mean of the opera and not of Billy Zane right when you say

20:12.840 --> 20:18.160
the fan either way really you know you think that's Billy Zane's most defining

20:18.160 --> 20:23.080
role this is go sit backstage with dad until you two have gotten this all out

20:23.080 --> 20:29.000
of your fucking system yeah and also he beat ass in Titanic yeah that's yeah so

20:29.000 --> 20:33.160
the dropping things on people is good but I'm gonna tweak it just a little bit

20:33.160 --> 20:38.080
please do because I'm evil on things yes it's a crime as fans I want to tweak

20:38.080 --> 20:43.600
it a little bit drop one of the let go the rope with the lights on it and then

20:43.600 --> 20:48.160
at the last second rush out be like no Daniel and like push him out of the way

20:48.160 --> 20:56.800
so then you'll be the hero of the school now very thin margin on this one because

20:56.800 --> 21:02.800
you would you could also distinguish yourself as Daniel's murderer and that

21:02.800 --> 21:10.680
begins your fans who've been career if you could sing a couple selections from

21:10.680 --> 21:14.440
Fiddler as you're rushing to tackle David out of the way of the falling

21:14.440 --> 21:19.120
light that would be good especially if while you're racing to save him and

21:19.120 --> 21:24.480
singing you know like tradition and you get killed by the falling light people

21:24.480 --> 21:29.800

these are the shoes that fried chicken footwear dreams are made of if you've

31:15.160 --> 31:20.120

31:20.120 --> 31:25.400
healthy mind they feature a realistic Kentucky Fried Chicken pattern because

31:25.400 --> 31:28.880
there's nothing worse than people looking at your shoes and saying that

31:28.880 --> 31:35.280
chickens not real and a nod to the iconic red stripe bucket they're sure

31:35.280 --> 31:42.240

32:17.720 --> 32:21.880
relevance to one another removable and that's probably where you tripped up

32:21.880 --> 32:26.680

currently craving the smell of scrambled eggs which is a food I don't like the

36:05.160 --> 36:13.000
taste of so has anyone else ever craved the smell of a food okay now what I I

36:13.000 --> 36:18.840
have to imagine that what they're not saying is smell the food and wanted to

36:18.840 --> 36:24.240
eat it because now yes that is literally what every being smell works what I

36:24.240 --> 36:28.600
think they're saying is man I wish I was smelling scrambled eggs right now that's

36:28.600 --> 36:35.800
explicitly what they're saying Travis I get this okay what do you wish you were

36:35.800 --> 36:40.640
can I ask what food you wish you were smelling no not eating only smelling with

36:40.640 --> 36:46.360
your nose senses right now the Bavarian nuts from the cart you know the one or

36:46.360 --> 36:51.320
they have at the movie theater sometime you smell them and they smell so fucking

36:51.320 --> 36:55.800
good you could float on this the stink just like float along with your nose

36:55.800 --> 37:00.000
like in cartoons and then we eat them they're kind of chewy and not that great

37:00.000 --> 37:04.680
and destroy your fillings yeah yeah so that's maybe one where I would crave the

37:04.680 --> 37:09.240
smell but not but let's talk about the let's talk about the word crave you walk

37:09.240 --> 37:12.120

38:32.520 --> 38:36.880
talked it up a lot hey did anybody else in this building at some point in the

38:36.880 --> 38:44.920
last ten minutes think to themselves I would fucking crush some kids I find

38:44.920 --> 38:50.400
that to be that is on the list of foods that I like the idea of eating sure yeah

38:50.400 --> 38:55.480
of course in concept yeah it's acid which which now I'm thinking maybe the

38:55.480 --> 39:01.040
concept is the smell I like the smell amount of flavor I like tasting a smell

39:01.040 --> 39:05.200
level of how much of this chicken do you want just one smell just one smell

39:05.200 --> 39:09.720
whatever particles can be wafted in the air is as much as I need to consume now

39:09.720 --> 39:15.120
with my 36 year old body that can no longer stomach there's fried stick right

39:15.120 --> 39:19.800
hey guys bad news I just remembered candles

39:19.800 --> 39:37.000
this if you can see Griffin's computer just as candles in 80.5 he had it

39:37.000 --> 39:43.800
tattooed on his body so you never forget John G loves to smell candles yeah I

39:43.800 --> 39:49.760
don't have candles guys but even then okay it's a huge industry do you think

39:49.760 --> 39:55.080
okay now what Griffin is saying is the end of the bit yeah you can't really

39:55.080 --> 39:59.440
there's no when you're looking at your collection of candles and choosing one

39:59.440 --> 40:03.520
you are craving a smell at that point here's what I want to know and I've

40:03.520 --> 40:07.520
never thought about this before but now we have this this audience that I can

40:07.520 --> 40:12.360
ask by round of applause is anyone here ever been sitting at home and thought I

40:12.360 --> 40:20.120
need to go buy a candle that smells like black okay from sitting at home from

40:20.120 --> 40:23.480
nothing you're just like oh I wish I had a candle that smelled like hot chocolate

40:23.480 --> 40:28.480
and that's worth going to the store Travis I'm a moderately successful

40:28.480 --> 40:36.160
podcaster I don't have to buy candles do you make them what does that mean

40:36.160 --> 40:41.960
don't apparently they just show up at your door like an early edition you

40:41.960 --> 40:46.240
don't need this candle tomorrow hey Justin how about another question I'd

40:46.240 --> 40:50.920
love that Griff I'm getting married to a wonderful woman later this year but

40:50.920 --> 40:57.680

40:59.640 --> 41:04.640
the other day after several failed attempts I had to tell her which photos

41:04.640 --> 41:09.960
to click to get through how can I be sure that the love of my life is not a

41:09.960 --> 41:15.200
robot and that's from hoping they're human from Huntington West Virginia are

41:15.200 --> 41:21.880
you here what's up River City super quick sounds like both of you are here

41:21.880 --> 41:31.480
are we related or friends did we go to high school together okay no okay so

41:31.480 --> 41:38.400
you're lying do you know do you know Josh Doddrell hey do you know all the

41:38.400 --> 41:44.080
same other people from Huntington that I know do you know Griffin McElroy hey

41:44.080 --> 41:51.240
so hmm him test is hard I get it let's talk about these tests and I don't know

41:51.240 --> 41:57.560
whoa stand back just I didn't want to start that when it says click all the

41:57.560 --> 42:00.680
boxes that have pictures of the crosswalk on it it wants you to click

42:00.680 --> 42:04.560
all the pictures of the street that have like the crosswalk paint on it the space

42:04.560 --> 42:10.320
above the crosswalk is still crosswalk that's where my body walks and crosses

42:10.320 --> 42:16.160
the street so I checked that some fucking computer is like no now which

42:16.160 --> 42:19.120
one of us is the computer same thing happens to me because it says click all

42:19.120 --> 42:24.080
the signs and I do that but then also I think that doorknob means he's a ghost

42:24.080 --> 42:28.440
I'm gonna be fun movie that's six cents but it wasn't gonna work even if it did

42:28.440 --> 42:32.520
make sense that happens with me sometimes where it's like click all like

42:32.520 --> 42:37.560
the cars and there'll be like a tiny little bit and I'm like does that count

42:37.560 --> 42:41.280
I won't click it and then that's how I find out I'm a robot right so I'm

42:41.280 --> 42:45.040
staying silent because I don't want to be named in the Seinfeld suit right

42:45.040 --> 42:49.360
about to be called against you guys okay fair enough okay let me take it a

42:49.360 --> 42:55.040
different direction okay so what if she's not okay interesting man them

42:55.040 --> 43:02.680
Cylons and Battlestar were pretty convincing yeah you love this being I assume

43:02.680 --> 43:09.880
human not human as long as they can eat food in a convincing manner and not die

43:09.880 --> 43:13.840
like an AI when Haley Joel Osment ate the salad or whatever and then was like

43:13.840 --> 43:20.080
it got all his gummy work he like fully died that movies what why can we say if

43:20.080 --> 43:24.500
you're designing some like a robot to be a boy not being able to eat cuz he'll

43:24.500 --> 43:29.320
die is a big whip not being able to take one bite of salad at a pool party your

43:29.320 --> 43:37.260
robot sucks shit I just make a tube straight down what do you have to go

43:37.260 --> 43:41.640
into the gear yeah what would it make that more believable is if it had been

43:41.640 --> 43:46.280
pizza cuz I think even if he knew he was gonna die an eight-year-old robot be

43:46.280 --> 43:52.520
like hell yeah let's go fuck up some pizza okay absolutely here you start by

43:52.520 --> 43:57.840
rubbing your finger your feet that's what they're called on the carpet and

43:57.840 --> 44:04.240
doing a like static shock with the finger if they surpass that that's step

44:04.240 --> 44:08.840
one we're going and then you escalate it leading to like the full Blade Runner

44:08.840 --> 44:14.280
test where you make a bunch Blade Runner you make a bunch Blade Runner and if

44:14.280 --> 44:28.280
they can sit through the whole thing years old robots aren't real I do now

44:28.280 --> 44:33.360
wait hold on stop yes they are Toyota can make one that like

44:33.360 --> 44:37.320
walks up a couple stairs before it eats shit but otherwise robots aren't real

44:37.320 --> 44:46.800
you're fine it's fucking movie magic so like fucking chill I I do you know what

44:46.800 --> 44:51.360
I like about the robot tests what at some point a human came up with that

44:51.360 --> 44:56.880
and they're like fuck yeah this will get them they'll never be able to identify

44:56.880 --> 45:00.840
patterns I fucking got him Valerie do you think when a computer comes across

45:00.840 --> 45:05.080
like I know what a fucking street light is a street light as you can hey hey I've

45:05.080 --> 45:08.960
got Google in me yeah I know your social security number you think I can't find

45:08.960 --> 45:13.440
the street lights if computers can't tell what street lights are let's maybe

45:13.440 --> 45:19.480
not have auto driving cars that's a good point if they can't identify crosswalks

45:19.480 --> 45:31.680
you cross like it no no I don't I'm a computer get out of the way I also can't

45:31.680 --> 45:39.000
tell you what a bus is why is it all car shit all the tests are all car shit

45:39.000 --> 45:48.320
whatever show moments of true happiness find the sad woman here's a identify the

45:48.320 --> 45:57.360
heartbroken child where's the couple faking it this boy has a balloon why is

45:57.360 --> 46:03.920

51:59.480 --> 52:03.480
if you when you come down like if you want to give us your name okay I'm

52:03.480 --> 52:12.880
Courtney hi though I have oh oh you're back okay I have some I have a baby oh

52:12.880 --> 52:16.360
congrats well I have three kids but the baby's the one that matters oh well then

52:16.360 --> 52:27.600
whoa that's what our parents said to you oh wait that's good for me yes so I have

52:27.600 --> 52:32.560
a baby and I have to work so we I work for the Ohio State University so we have

52:32.560 --> 52:39.200
a we have a pumping you're shelling for your college yeah no but so we have a

52:39.200 --> 52:41.680
pumping room because we're pretty progressive and also legally they're

52:41.680 --> 52:51.760
supposed to have so legally legally legally mandated humanity I spent a good

52:51.760 --> 53:03.640
deal of my time in the lactation room pumping my own human milk right so so

53:03.640 --> 53:10.680
it's it's real boring in there and all I can hear is that noise of the pump I'm

53:10.680 --> 53:15.520
sure you're all familiar yeah and and the real problem is I've tried to come

53:15.520 --> 53:18.800
up with a couple ways that were like fun to help pass the time first I tried

53:18.800 --> 53:23.400
knitting but then I needed my hands and then I tried listening to podcasts or

53:23.400 --> 53:27.920
watching TV the real problem is we make you laugh so hard it doesn't happen well

53:27.920 --> 53:32.840
no the real problem is the pumping room is attached to a conference room we're a

53:32.840 --> 53:40.440
little too ribald for the business I start like there's a wall they can't see

53:40.440 --> 53:44.920
me but I here's the thing there's always a meeting in there every time I have to

53:44.920 --> 53:52.840
go in and so between the and the meat cackling with laughter yeah yeah so is

53:52.840 --> 53:57.120
there anything I can do to have fun while pumping my own human milk that's

53:57.120 --> 54:05.360
not too loud sure sure sure sure sure super normal question yeah it's hey can

54:05.360 --> 54:09.680
I say something this is like our thousandth live show this is like the

54:09.680 --> 54:13.840
bottom 15% of like normal see I don't think you have anything to worry about

54:13.840 --> 54:17.680
I also breast milk and pumping and breastfeeding is totally normal it's

54:17.680 --> 54:24.680
chill hey hey I we posed this to Sydney backstage and she said she used to do

54:24.680 --> 54:29.960
competitions with another doctor that was also pumping see who could grind

54:29.960 --> 54:35.120
out the most like they were on an episode of wild and crazy kids like it

54:35.120 --> 54:38.960
right like while they were pumping they chased the giant earth ball around right

54:38.960 --> 54:42.480
they would they would pump it out they would put it on a bowl on another kid's

54:42.480 --> 54:46.480
head and he would try to take as much as we could over the beaker and dump it out

54:46.480 --> 54:52.000
without spilling any no they would just have regular competitions to see who

54:52.000 --> 55:01.280
could get the most milk right human milk you made it weird not me that's one

55:01.280 --> 55:04.940
thing you could use if there's something else in there just get into a comic make

55:04.940 --> 55:12.080
it competitive we don't share the room don't share the room I mean you're gonna

55:12.080 --> 55:20.800
need just do it on Twitch and that way you're gonna need a Rita Hayworth poster

55:20.800 --> 55:25.280
and some rock working tools this has been in every episode of the last ten

55:25.280 --> 55:29.400
did you just see that movie for the first time okay I just remembered the

55:29.400 --> 55:34.960
name Rita Hayworth okay cool I'm really excited about it I'm gonna get you out

55:34.960 --> 55:43.000
of this business the hard way pump through some horrible sewer tubes but in

55:43.000 --> 55:49.440
the end I know how to keep you busy during breast pump you gotta get the

55:49.440 --> 55:59.240
fuck out of there what about an audiobook some that's sad yeah it's not funny it's

55:59.240 --> 56:04.720
just a thing you could do maybe a crossword you said it's boring right

56:04.720 --> 56:10.080
it's incredibly boring yeah I can I imagine that is true so you want to just

56:10.080 --> 56:15.560
like get done with it right if I mean do you have tips for lactating faster I'm

56:15.560 --> 56:26.560
about to say instead of a podcast I got this instead of a podcast instead of an

56:26.560 --> 56:29.960
audiobook before you're too mean remember he is a man with a broken ass

56:29.960 --> 56:38.240
go on why don't you put on on the cans on the ones and twos some quad city

56:38.240 --> 56:47.800
DJs that's gonna get things moving that is how it works yeah I clearly I didn't

56:47.800 --> 56:53.240
think that everybody was going to make such a big deal about or else I wouldn't

56:53.240 --> 56:58.840
have started my great quad city DJs Elvis Costello bump it up that's a

56:58.840 --> 57:05.040
little bit more on the nose on brand a fushigi but with one hand one-handed

57:05.040 --> 57:11.480
contact juggling pumping iron pumping iron white that's good there's no

57:11.480 --> 57:16.600
reason the other hand can't get swole wire of pumping human milk you've

57:16.600 --> 57:22.040
ruined it now does that help hey how about this what if you just scream and

57:22.040 --> 57:27.320
scream at the top of your lungs and then you could be like oh I guess the wall

57:27.320 --> 57:31.320
should be a bit thicker in the pumping room gang and then you can listen to

57:31.320 --> 57:48.720
podcasts and laugh yeah hello my name is Brian hi Brian my girlfriend is really

59:39.640 --> 59:47.040
McElroy memoir audiobook aloud you can then continue your conversation that's

59:47.040 --> 59:51.800

and of itself it's like if Olive Garden fucked that be fizzle ease so I don't

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.880
think I'm with on team Justin here I do not see the issue but that's their

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:34.220
slogan fizzle ease when you don't want to drive to the mall we fuck the bread

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:39.680
sticks are oh they're unlimited I didn't you can have as many as you want right

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:46.920
you know that how about the baked ziti okay wait Brian even buying into your

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.960
point even if they weren't that good how good do they have to be to make

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.560
unlimited a good deal you know me if they're 1% good Brian eat a hundred of

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.140
them Brian did you know they make us they make a sandwich out of him now

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.400
Brian well they'll put super sloppy pizza in the middle of the breadstick

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.680
they'll cut the breadstick open put the pizza fixings right in there Brian I'm

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:19.360
you know what I'm on team Justin Brian you've got to develop an affinity I'm

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.800
sorry I've been so hard on you I just haven't eaten bread for five days and I

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:30.800
would do despicable things you would walk to the box office and demand a

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.920
refund for the fucking spectacle it'd be like when King Kong frees himself on

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.720
stage and he's just eating people like that would be your reaction to my

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.520
housing unlimited they I hope they are unlimited because that it will be my

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.040
consumption we thought they were unlimited but it turns out there was a

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.000
limited number of them okay you've got to develop an affinity for some place

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.840
that gets even more nastier and more ribald than fazoles and can we think of

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:08.120
any chunky cheese that's too fun there's lots of great games fun stuff there what

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:16.960
is golden corral options options very good hey we don't guys this is a

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.840
podcast that has a segment in it called munch squad we don't need reminders of

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:28.120

sorry I said who the fuck are you you're great I'm sorry that was mean hello hi

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.760
hi what do you have to say about fazoles

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:06.640
I'm sorry I interrupted begin again I apologize hi my name is Ryan right

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.340
answer him hello okay so I am going to driving school currently to you know

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.120
learn how to drive nice like a normal performing citizen one of the top things

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:25.440
to do a driving school it's that and find yourself well I fell asleep like

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.760
mid-class one that is driving okay we were all on that page right okay good

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:39.840
right you're fine go on anyways I passed hopefully I will too but I woke up and

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.160
there was just a mint in my mouth

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:53.840
and I didn't I didn't consume a mint before I assume so why are you wouldn't

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.160
ask the question Ryan we've been doing this for 60 minutes you can't introduce

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:06.760
such challenging ideas to support the podcast it was not a mint okay let's

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.840
dig deep okay are there other details you wish to share about this mystery

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:18.640
before I call her cute poro so uses a little gray sales well okay I was

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:29.920
considering like confronting the class like thank you for the free man I'm not

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.760
mad I'm just disappointed Ryan what happened what happened Ryan that would

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.040
be a horrible like no one would mess up to putting a mint in my mouth I was I

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:47.400
would yeah from downtown I know but I yelled buckets it was awesome

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.280
were you sleeping like this there's no okay no there's no position you can lay

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.840
in that invites someone to place a mint in your no no I'm not saying I want to

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:04.000
clarify that for everyone real quick okay let me rephrase everybody's

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.560
cheering like this is a problem I agree if it did happen it would be a problem

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.720
that would invite some sort of evil mint bandit to try to say this is not a good

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:21.880
kid doing this this is a is there a driving school class clown if so don't

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:30.600
let them on the road but it's not even a class clown it's a class like pushy oral

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:38.680
hygienist like it's not clownish behavior no clown has ever been like

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:48.120
your fingers got in my goddamn mouth for real they did sometimes I surprise even

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:55.480
myself Ryan are these mints that you consume on a regular basis this brand of

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.640
mint no could you place it could you place the mint type yeah was it mentos

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:08.120
was it okay hold on let's just let's at least establish this size of mint are we

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.920
talking about a tic-tac are we talking about like a fucking candy cane

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:18.280
social threats in what we got yes I woke up with the whole candy oh now it's

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.320
weird yeah no it's like one of those little white like swirly ones or an

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:31.780
Altoid or like a spin five more minutes figuring out okay like a life save like

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:43.520
a like a search like a yeah okay okay everyone put your heads down if you are

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:51.840
the one raise your hand I won't be mad seeing a lot of hands go up oh Jesus

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:58.360
this was a heist all right Ryan is it possible that they were paying it

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.920
forward but they didn't really understand the point this will be is it

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.360
possible that this will be nice I was about to ask if that helps but I know it

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:19.400
doesn't so let's part peacefully and amicably Paul's got mints for you Paul's

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:27.360
got a cruel mockery offering a mint Paul has made this a an ARG that makes it all

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:37.880
better Paul that's very everyone enjoy yeah some Paul's great Paul by the way

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.400
do you still have my mint container that still has all my road ecstasy in it oh

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:50.580
no not to be confused with your whole ecstasy for home use hey what's up hi my

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:59.600
name is Maya you she heard trans rights what's up Maya said trans rights Maya I

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.700
would just want to thank you you've been last in line but you've been so

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:08.060
visibly supportive of all of our question ask your hand when I asked who

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:15.300
put them in quite the fucking twist the right behind you it was Maya anyways my

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:21.360
question is I put a mint in someone's mouth okay I'm sorry to take away from your remote

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.920
I'm a little drunk they put like six shots in the Jack and Coke out there oh

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.640
damn my town that's so weird I asked the bartender to make it strong as we were

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:38.000
walking past because they said I told him it's funnier if the thank you all

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
right what's your question Maya so my little sister is extremely popular in

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.840
high school she's cool like everybody okay I showed her ginko jeans at first

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:57.640
right oh yes and she screamed that they were ugly okay pearls before swine right

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:06.520
Maya did she say those are the fazoles of pants not incorrect

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:14.240
that plus there's lots of places the high free bread yes how big are the legs

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:21.640
they're already 30 to 40 breadsticks at least okay so jinkos were a bust so I

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:27.880
showed her acid wash jeans and she was into it yeah she's got two eyes and a

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:36.500
heart how how can I get her to bring it back into style to influence all her

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:43.360
friends at school to bring acid wash jeans back for the why so that you may

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.920
wear acid wash jeans absolutely okay father-in-law makes the best acid wash

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.480
jeans you've ever seen okay so I see what we're doing here all right Maya

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.280
it's very delete a little bit you got the smoke as they want jeans on tap it's

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:04.480
a profit deal you're trying to create a market for these great jeans okay my

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:12.480
dad's got barrels and barrels of jeans acid he can acid wash anything not just

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:20.120
jeans he hasn't washed the dog this jeans he asked and wash around a rabbit

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:27.440
okay now here's the thing she can't wear them absolutely not what she needs to do

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.800
is show pictures of them to other people and say I wish I had a pair of these

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:42.040
because yeah but you don't get high on your own supply what where my dad's

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:50.920
actually I'm cool my legs have to maintain a very specific pH balance

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:56.080
wearing your own acid wash jeans is a perversion my father-in-law gonna test

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:02.080
so but here's the thing I don't wear acid wash jeans all the time and I don't

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.960
influence people to wear acid wash jeans step two why not why not I don't really

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:13.920
give a shit do you think that the one influences the other that if you maybe

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:19.280
wore them more often you would influence more people yeah but I do think that

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.480
there would be at least at that point a causal relationship between the two

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.120
things what if you stood up right now and suddenly you had on acid wash and

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.720
just under the table we've had a slow drip of acid on the group it's like no

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.600
what's been slowly tripping onto my legs the whole time we've been doing this

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.800
show is blood and cerebrospinal fluid

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.400
you could just have her start a rumor that all the big streamers are wearing

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.080
acid wash jeans underneath there yeah like if ninja stood up and he was just

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.080
wearing acid wash jeans and then some other ones that I'm sure have names

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.280
stood up to and all the streamers had acid wash jeans I don't know how she's

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.180
gonna make that now that I say it it sounds stupid this isn't just got his

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.840
lucky acid wash jeans under on under his everywhere's I'm like everything

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.240
else we've said so far this isn't gonna help but this is just a question I'm now

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.800
wondering about for your father-in-law yes you gotta set a pretty specific

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.920
timer for acid washing jeans right because if you go too long no more G

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.280
they're just white jeans there's gotta be a boy you're like oh did I get those

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:39.680
then you've got jeans washed acid and no one's gonna buy that my eye does that

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:46.360
help yeah it's the best we deserve thank you

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.920
go ahead and bring those house lights down we appreciate you we did not

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:58.040
