00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.160 --> 00:57.360
I'm Griffin McElroy, and it got me good this year.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.480
Griffin, were you shot? Are you okay? You got hit by a dart?

01:02.480 --> 01:08.160
The tip of that just got me, Odell. The tip of that just got me.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.720
They got me good. The tax man got me so bad.

01:14.320 --> 01:21.280
Oh, they cometh and they just nipped me right in the duff with these taxes this time.

01:21.280 --> 01:28.080
I tell you, the bad experience I had is the tax man cameth, and I said,

01:28.080 --> 01:32.960
hey, I never thought to ask. I was just writing him a check, and I was like,

01:32.960 --> 01:38.160
I never thought to ask, who gets this? And he was like, the president?

01:38.160 --> 01:41.360
And I was like, wait a minute. I don't even like that fella.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.880
I don't even want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.120
Here's what I did.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.560
Wait, how'd that play out?

01:48.560 --> 01:50.960
He was like, well, what do you want to do with it?

01:50.960 --> 01:52.800
I was like, could he build a dam?

01:53.680 --> 01:58.880
Because I feel like, I know the wall is so hot right now, and everybody's wild for it,

01:58.880 --> 02:04.560
but what about a dam instead? A real powerful dam like America used to build.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.600
In my grandpa's days, a powerful dam.

02:07.600 --> 02:12.000
A powerful grandpa dam. I did a thing this year for taxes.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.960
This is a little life hack that they don't tell you at accounting school,

02:14.960 --> 02:19.760
but rather than give my money, just every time I made a purchase,

02:19.760 --> 02:25.520
I chopped off like a quarter of it and just sent that to the government.

02:25.520 --> 02:31.360
So they got like a quarter of my Capri Sun, and like a quarter of a new pair of tennis shoes,

02:31.360 --> 02:38.320
and that way they're still getting a quarter of everything I own.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.360
Okay.

02:39.360 --> 02:47.360
So in the fiction of your little confection,

02:48.720 --> 02:55.120
in the fiction of your confection, the IRS opens a super sloppy envelope,

02:55.120 --> 02:59.680
and it's got a quarter of a big back on it, and a picture of your face smiling,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.640
and I would presume your social security number?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.520
Yeah, or they wouldn't know what to bucket to put it in.

03:05.520 --> 03:10.560
And then there's a post-it note that says four podcasts on it,

03:10.560 --> 03:13.760
so they know what the income source was.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.080
And then they're like, four podcasts, we wish.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.160
I'll tell you about the life hack I've got.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.000
Little money hack, and this one's good for your wallet,

03:22.960 --> 03:25.760
is you know how I bought that cigarette boat back in 2017,

03:26.960 --> 03:29.920
and then they got me with that cigarette boat tax in 2018.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.480
Ah. In 2018, I bought a second cigarette boat,

03:35.360 --> 03:37.520
and the tax, it didn't double.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.920
It's like a, now it's like a fraction of the first.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.200
So if I just keep buying cigarette boats,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.560
eventually- You'll have a carton of boats.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.320
It'll be a profit generator.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.240
My dad's gonna make me smoke all my boats.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.280
It's gonna be a revenue stream,

03:53.280 --> 03:56.160
because the taxes are gonna be nothing on these puppies.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.520
And then you can open up like a water taxi business, or like-

03:59.520 --> 04:00.880
Yeah. You know,

04:00.880 --> 04:02.000
one of those things where it's like,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
hey, do you wanna go out and look at the water

04:04.000 --> 04:06.240
that's farther out away from the land?

04:06.240 --> 04:07.920
Because that's different water.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.760
Yeah. You can do that.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.680
I've seen people do that at beaches and stuff,

04:11.680 --> 04:14.160
where it's like, I could stand on the dirt and see the water,

04:14.160 --> 04:17.440
or I could go out like 100 yards onto the water

04:17.440 --> 04:18.800
and see better water.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.720
And I could stage cigarette boat fights

04:21.280 --> 04:24.240
in the, you know, in Lake Travis or whatever,

04:24.240 --> 04:25.840
and get people all around for that.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.680
There's a lake named after me?

04:27.680 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, sell tickets to the cigarette boat fight?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.360
This is money, money, money, money.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.200
But then they get, and then they freaking get it

04:33.200 --> 04:34.640
to build another dam next year.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.160
Dammit! There's no winning.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.600
Griffin, you could sell those boats.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.440
Oh, don't even sell the boats.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.480
Quote unquote, loan them to a stunt spectacular.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.200
And then when they explode, insurance money.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.000
Not taxed.

04:46.000 --> 04:46.960
I lost my boat.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.600
You guys, I was about to talk about how cigarette boat

04:51.600 --> 04:54.080
is a pretty bad name for that,

04:54.080 --> 04:56.240
because it sounds like something wild.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.920
Like, that sounds like a wild thing.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.440
That replaces the term rum runner,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.640
is the former slang term for these,

05:04.640 --> 05:06.320
because smugglers used to love them.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.040
But get this.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.640
The real name of this, according to Wikipedia,

05:13.440 --> 05:17.280
Jeff Bezos' Wikipedia, according to Wikipedia,

05:18.720 --> 05:20.720
it's called a go fast boat.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.360
No.

05:21.360 --> 05:21.920
Yeah, okay.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.680
It's called a go fast boat.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.160
Yeah, sure.

05:26.160 --> 05:31.120
Go hyphen fast boat.

05:31.120 --> 05:31.520
Okay.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.040
Well, let me check the,

05:33.040 --> 05:36.640
oh my God, the go fast boat tax rate is so much lower.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.400
I've been getting really boinked on this one.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.240
I really got to talk to my people.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.000
Can I tell you, this is true.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.200
When I was a kid and I first heard the term cigarette boat,

05:47.200 --> 05:50.000
that was during a time where, if I'm not mistaken,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.920
I think there were like camel bucks or something

05:51.920 --> 05:54.640
that you got like little coupons and stuff.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.240
I thought that a cigarette boat

05:56.240 --> 06:00.160
was a boat that you earned from smoking a lot of cigarettes.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.800
I once redeemed points from a similar system

06:03.520 --> 06:07.280
to buy a Mountain Dew branded pager.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.160
Hell yes.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.480
This man's a dealer of some sort.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.200
Yes, that's right.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.480
What does he deal?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.280
Extreme excellence in sports?

06:19.280 --> 06:19.760
I don't know.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.040
He's always ready for a LAN party, I think.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.480
I think that's it.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.680
Hey, let's do some questions.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.440
He's an eSports agent.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.960
He's gotta be on call.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
A question is what Griffin requested

06:30.960 --> 06:32.880
and I live to serve my brother here.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.120
We're recording this on sibling day,

06:35.120 --> 06:36.960
so I have to do as Griffin bids.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.240
Every day for me is sibling day.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.680
You guys are my world.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.400
Did you just sigh, did you just sigh at what I said?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.840
It was a contented sigh.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.080
It was like, oh, how sweet.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.640
I work at a contemporary art museum

06:48.640 --> 06:51.600
and people keep asking me, what kind of art do you have?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.960
What does that mean?

06:52.960 --> 06:55.680
What should I respond with besides paintings and sculptures?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.120
What kind of art are there?

06:57.120 --> 06:59.280
Is this art from in Austin, Texas?

07:00.720 --> 07:03.520
Oh boy, I mean, you've come to the right place.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.640
Yes, obviously.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.200
Art critics.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.800
I like to think of myself as something

07:06.800 --> 07:10.480
of a amateur volunteer docent.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.080
You haven't gone pro yet?

07:14.080 --> 07:16.640
Well, I'm sort of a docent to the world.

07:16.640 --> 07:16.880
Yeah.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.160
Not working at any, not sort of tied to any one

07:20.160 --> 07:24.960
establishment, just sort of wondering the streets

07:24.960 --> 07:28.400
and telling people about good art that I saw once.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.240
When they ask what kind of art do you have,

07:32.240 --> 07:35.920
they're talking about one of the main buckets of art

07:35.920 --> 07:39.280
and that's shapes paintings is one,

07:39.920 --> 07:42.000
folks paintings, which is ones of folks,

07:43.440 --> 07:47.040
statues and hanging statues, those are so fun.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.560
You get one of those hanging statues

07:48.560 --> 07:50.240
with all the shapes and dongle bits on it.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.040
That's really cool.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.040
Especially the hanging statues with the light.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.640
And it's like, well, that's a dirty word

07:56.640 --> 07:57.760
when you look at it that way.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.400
Oh, but it's like, oh dear, when you look at it this way,

08:00.400 --> 08:01.520
I love those.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.160
And then there's just, there's a bucket called stuff.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.520
And this is one where that's like,

08:05.520 --> 08:08.880
if it's an old vase that somebody painted,

08:09.760 --> 08:12.560
usually a horse on or a beheading,

08:13.680 --> 08:15.280
then that's just kind of, that's just stuff.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.040
That's just the flotsam and jetsam of the thing.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.760
Can I tell you my least favorite bucket of art

08:19.760 --> 08:23.600
is the bucket of might be a chair,

08:23.600 --> 08:24.880
but isn't don't sit on it.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.080
Oh gosh.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.920
Those get me every time.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.840
That might be what they're calling when they're like,

08:29.840 --> 08:30.800
what kind of art do you have?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.880
Just say like, none of it looks like chairs.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.680
Don't worry.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.180
Don't worry.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.680
One thing that is an easy out for you

08:37.680 --> 08:41.040
is because you work at a contemporary art museum

08:41.040 --> 08:42.880
and people kind of ask what kind of art you have,

08:42.880 --> 08:44.960
you can just look at it and be like, the new shit.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.720
We got the new releases.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.480
The new hot shit.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.160
Yeah.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.080
None of that old garbage.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.320
Just the hottest new sound.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.880
We used to have a water lilies from Monet,

08:56.880 --> 08:59.760
but we threw that in the fucking garbage can.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.680
And here's one I made with puke.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.120
This is Trent's puke shirt.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.640
He made it two weeks ago.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.320
It's the new shit.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.000
It'll be out of here in nine days.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.600
So enjoy it while it lasts.

09:11.600 --> 09:17.600
I'm gonna throw it right on top of Claude Monet's busted old ass.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.360
Here's a dream catcher we made

09:19.360 --> 09:21.280
from the shredded up water lilies.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.080
It's hot shit.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.640
And the poor thing is, it's new.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.240
Oh, boy.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.280
That's all the things we know to say about art,

09:31.280 --> 09:32.080
ladies and gentlemen.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.320
I was trying to think who was the nasty mess one.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.280
The one who made the-

09:35.280 --> 09:37.680
Jackson Pollock made the nasty messes.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.000
Yes.

09:38.000 --> 09:38.880
Kevin Pollock.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.640
Now we're fully exhausted.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.440
And all of the things we know to say about art.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.880
A similar thing used to happen to me

09:44.880 --> 09:46.000
when I worked at Best Buy,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.520
and people would call and say,

09:47.520 --> 09:49.200
what kind of TVs do you have?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.760
Like, tell me about your TVs.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.000
And I don't know if y'all know this.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.760
It's a lot of TVs.

09:55.760 --> 09:56.880
It's like you're being pranked.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.640
And I think, here's all you have to say.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.560
If someone says, what kind of art do you have?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.720
Say, art I think you'll like.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.920
And then say, wink.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.720
Because they're calling and they won't see it.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.120
This is such a wild, unanswerable question

10:09.120 --> 10:11.600
that I think you have to judo it back onto them.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.520
And say, what kind of art are you looking for?

10:14.480 --> 10:15.760
Because the answer is that-

10:15.760 --> 10:16.720
What would I have to do

10:16.720 --> 10:19.120
to get you into some of this art today?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.120
I go to art museums.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.600
I visit Houston and they have so many art museums.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.440
Every time we go, we'll hit up a couple art museums.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.080
They're wonderful.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.640
If you were to ask me three feet from the front fucking door,

10:30.640 --> 10:32.560
hey, Griffin, what are you excited to see in there?

10:32.560 --> 10:32.960
I'd be like,

10:34.960 --> 10:36.480
and I would run away

10:36.480 --> 10:38.240
because I'd feel challenged in that moment.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.240
Because I don't know what kind of art I want.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.360
I just want to see it.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.720
And then sometimes you'll see a painting

10:42.720 --> 10:45.920
that you saw on a TV show once and that's cool.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.120
Yeah, that's pretty great.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.680
I think no matter what you tell these people,

10:49.680 --> 10:51.120
they're not fucking coming.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.880
If they're asking this question,

10:52.880 --> 10:54.960
no one gets to the door of an art museum,

10:55.520 --> 10:57.440
peeks in and is like, what the fuck is all this?

10:58.800 --> 11:00.320
What is going on in here?

11:00.320 --> 11:03.520
No one drives there to look in the door

11:03.520 --> 11:05.600
to see what kind of good art you have.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.920
I mean, just regular art.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.280
It doesn't do anything.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.200
I like art that does something.

11:11.200 --> 11:11.840
You know how-

11:11.840 --> 11:13.280
Like Cosi.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.800
You know the fuck, yes.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.920
A big pendulum that knocks shit over

11:17.920 --> 11:20.160
and I just learned about rotation of the earth.

11:20.160 --> 11:20.720
I love it.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.200
You know that everlasting gobsopper machine.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.400
It burps and farts with all kinds of beautiful colors all over

11:28.400 --> 11:30.240
and at the end you got yourself a sweet treat.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.760
There's a whole fucking room in there

11:31.760 --> 11:34.480
where you can lick the art and it tastes like shit.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.960
No one has ever let me lick art.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.560
I went to this art museum once

11:38.560 --> 11:43.040
where they let you put on these futuristic looking vests

11:43.040 --> 11:44.960
and they gave you a little fake gun

11:44.960 --> 11:47.520
and you could run around and shoot each other's vests

11:47.520 --> 11:50.480
and you would get points if you did a good enough job

11:50.480 --> 11:54.320
and then afterward you could go out to the concession stand

11:54.320 --> 11:55.680
and you could have a pizza.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.320
That's the best museum I've ever been to in my life.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.440
Billy Bob's Wonderland.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.360
It was a Q-Zar, I think.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.720
It was a Q-Zar Museum of Art.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.840
Yes, the Q-Zar modern museum of moving laser tag.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.520
Designed by Guggenheim or whatever.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.760
It's the Guggenheim Q-Zar Museum.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.000
I only like poetry that has clues to a treasure.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.320
That's art.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.600
I only like paintings painted on top of another painting

12:21.600 --> 12:23.440
that you can only see with an x-ray

12:23.440 --> 12:24.800
and it leads you to something.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.880
Songs that are meant to put a dragon to sleep.

12:28.880 --> 12:29.760
That is a song.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.480
It does something.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.320
I want to call a museum now and be like,

12:34.320 --> 12:37.040
hey, I'm really excited to come to a museum.

12:37.040 --> 12:37.760
Very stoked.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.960
I hear you got a Matisse, I think is one of them.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.120
Anyway, do you have any of those paintings

12:45.120 --> 12:48.560
where the eyes follow you no matter where you are?

12:48.560 --> 12:49.680
Because fuck that.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.160
I'm very scared of whoever's in there.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.320
Do you have any paintings that I might be afraid

12:54.320 --> 12:57.280
to be trapped in by a witch that I've crossed?

12:57.280 --> 13:00.320
Because if so, no, thank you.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.600
Do you have any paintings

13:01.600 --> 13:04.400
where you have to kind of cross your eyes

13:04.400 --> 13:06.480
to see them in their 3D?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.960
Because I love, I'm wild for that shit

13:08.960 --> 13:09.920
and no one's got it.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.640
My ma used to have them at a concession stand.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.480
That was all these goddamn fidget spinners.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.120
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Michelle Smith.

13:17.120 --> 13:17.360
Thank you.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.280
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user name.

13:19.920 --> 13:20.640
Oh my God.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.680
I would usually look around the page for inspiration

13:23.680 --> 13:25.520
for what to call these anonymous users.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.440
And right now I'm looking at a Yahoo Finance

13:27.440 --> 13:29.440
just like video that's in the sidebar.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.760
And here's the headline.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.480
I want a Munch, Munch Squad Junior.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.760
Running on Dunkin?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.480
Coffee Giant debuts signature sneaker.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.720
So these are shoes that say Dunkin Donuts on them.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.400
This is very strange.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.480
This would be like if you were reading a Munch Squad

13:44.480 --> 13:47.120
and there was just a Yahoo embedded in the middle of it.

13:47.120 --> 13:47.920
I'm freaking out.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.760
Okay, anyway, this anonymous user

13:49.760 --> 13:51.280
who doesn't deserve a name asks,

13:52.640 --> 13:55.840
all I want in life is to be able to cruise

13:55.840 --> 13:57.840
on my motorcycle with my dog.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.360
How can I do that?

13:59.360 --> 14:02.320
I know sidecars are an option, but besides that,

14:03.600 --> 14:06.960
my dog is 80 pounds of Doberman slash Pitbull.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.800
Update, demo.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.200
Can you link me some carriers that would be good for that?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.680
And I guess there's a, well, wait, there is no demo.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.800
I'm looking at all three answers.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.280
And one's from Marion, one's from Bill,

14:19.280 --> 14:21.920
and one's from babyboomer1001,

14:21.920 --> 14:25.440
which is a very sort of redundant name to have on Yahoo.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.400
Of course you are.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.920
I love the, you sometimes drop these Yahoo's, Griffin,

14:29.920 --> 14:32.160
where it's like, here is my question,

14:32.160 --> 14:35.360
and I know what the answer is, but I don't want that answer.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.160
It sounds to me like the question asker

14:40.880 --> 14:45.880
would like the dog to be driving the motorcycle

14:47.600 --> 14:52.240
with this asker riding in the back of it.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.760
See, even then, I still would prefer

14:55.760 --> 14:59.760
if my dog was, if my 80 pound of Doberman slash Pitbull

14:59.760 --> 15:01.520
was gonna be up there driving,

15:01.520 --> 15:03.200
I would wanna be in the sidecar.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.760
It's not an option, Travis.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.080
We got a very narrow tunnel that we're planning on going to.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.520
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.160
So that's just out of the question.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.920
I need to get my dog on this bike.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.400
He is-

15:14.400 --> 15:17.200
See, then it seems more about the grips.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.240
You would have special,

15:19.040 --> 15:20.800
something they could slip their paws into.

15:21.440 --> 15:25.360
Yeah, that's a big old dog, 80 pounds, it feels like.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.760
So a baby Bjorn, a traditional baby Bjorn,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.280
is not gonna go ahead and get you there.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.800
Now, let me tell you about,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.120
I want a baby Bjorn I could put Travis in.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.520
Yes, please, I was thinking about this the other day.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.920
My daughter's about 30 pounds and about three feet tall,

15:39.920 --> 15:44.480
and I'm six feet tall, and about 200 pounds will round up.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.960
So I did the math, and I think that means

15:46.960 --> 15:52.000
that I need a 12 foot tall, 1600 pound person

15:52.000 --> 15:53.120
to carry me around.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.440
I think if I'm doing that math correctly,

15:57.440 --> 16:00.320
I just want a giant to carry me around.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.680
Oh, it feels so good, but that's not the question.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.920
Oh, it feels so nice.

16:03.920 --> 16:08.160
What if, I'll just keep putting these heaters up.

16:08.160 --> 16:08.880
Yeah, please.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.760
What if the bike is the dog?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.240
Okay, elaborate.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.680
You ever heard of this hybrid technology

16:21.680 --> 16:23.280
that's going on these days?

16:24.000 --> 16:28.720
Now, Griffin, do you mean the hybrid cars

16:28.720 --> 16:31.280
that run on both gasoline and electric?

16:31.280 --> 16:32.240
No, man, no, man.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.560
I'm talking about bio cyber melting.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.840
You know about this shit?

16:35.840 --> 16:36.720
Do you know about this shit?

16:36.720 --> 16:37.760
Justin, you heard about this shit?

16:40.720 --> 16:41.920
Go on, Griffin, tell me about it.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.240
Are you talking about like a robot dog bike?

16:45.280 --> 16:47.600
Yeah, and I think they're real good,

16:47.600 --> 16:49.520
and everybody has robot dog bikes.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.800
Oh no, oh no, one's crushing my front door.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.160
It's running over me over and over.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.240
I died, but I got killed by the thing

16:58.240 --> 16:59.520
I liked about the future.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.120
So that's my new black mirror.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.600
I found the thing I really liked about the future,

17:05.600 --> 17:07.840
but they ended up driving over me and biting me.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.080
It's like, oh, it's running over me

17:12.080 --> 17:13.840
and biting me every time it goes.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.440
But those are the two worst parts

17:15.440 --> 17:17.280
of both a motorcycle and a dog.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.720
I should explain, if you haven't seen the series,

17:20.720 --> 17:22.880
Black Mirror, every episode ends with someone

17:22.880 --> 17:25.520
getting run over by a cyborg dog bike.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.080
So that is kind of the gag of that bit.

17:28.080 --> 17:32.320
Sometimes it's more, kind of, it makes more sense than others.

17:32.320 --> 17:36.880
Yeah, sometimes it's a metaphorical cyborg dog bike,

17:36.880 --> 17:40.960
like a particularly weighty insult hurled at that person.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.920
And then they say, oh, that was my dog bike,

17:43.920 --> 17:44.640
and then they die.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.720
Yeah, the one where the two women forged

17:46.720 --> 17:50.240
a powerful relationship in the cyber environment,

17:50.240 --> 17:54.000
I thought was amazing and so touching and heartwarming

17:54.000 --> 17:58.800
until they got their own two big dog bikes.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.600
And that was a weird, I was feeling uplifted,

18:01.600 --> 18:03.120
and then that's how Black Mirror gets you,

18:03.120 --> 18:04.320
because the future, it's deeks.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.080
But it's always the twist.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.800
Yeah, so, all right.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.960
What about a big shirt?

18:11.760 --> 18:14.080
Big shirt doesn't have big dogs.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.120
No, like you wear a shirt,

18:15.120 --> 18:16.560
but also the dog fits in a shirt.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.280
Maybe big pants too that the dog also fits in.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.680
A training shirt, he won't need that all the time.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.960
This is what big dog shirts are made for.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.160
This is what big dogs is.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.720
Yeah, shirts you can wear with your dog.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.880
That's what big dog shirts is for this entire time.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.400
Then what are big Johnson shirts?

18:33.280 --> 18:34.880
That's when you can stuff your hog up in.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.040
No problem.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.440
No fear is the one where you hide your fear in the shirt.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.600
Fear, shh, stay quiet in there.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.360
Can't let anyone know.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.200
I'll take the fear.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.640
I'm your shirt, I'll take the fear.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.600
It's made of this fear sponge material.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.800
It's so soft, it wicks the fear away.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.440
It wicks it right away.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.800
Jerome, let me wick your fear.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.400
Jerome, I'll wick your fear.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.240
I'm getting wet as fuck in this shirt,

19:08.240 --> 19:10.880
but I am not afraid, thank you.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.000
You wanna read a question?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.680
I recently decided to patronize...

19:13.680 --> 19:16.400
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.760
You fucking nerd.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.040
I recently decided to patronize my local concert hall on a whim,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.360
arriving only a few months before the concert started.

19:27.360 --> 19:27.840
No.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.240
Minutes, what is wrong with you?

19:30.240 --> 19:31.120
What'd I say?

19:31.120 --> 19:31.600
Months.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.120
Hey, you guys throw a concert here in June?

19:37.120 --> 19:40.880
Yeah, but it's only a few months.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.600
Better hurry.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.120
Who's playing?

19:43.920 --> 19:45.840
Well, two months from now, we got a simple plan.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.520
Ah, fuck.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.000
Okay, I guess I'll stay for that.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.560
I decided to patronize my local concert hall on a whim,

19:56.560 --> 19:59.520
arriving only a few minutes before the concert started.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.480
As I was approaching the box office to purchase a ticket,

20:02.480 --> 20:05.440
a woman intercepted me and all but insisted

20:05.440 --> 20:08.160
I use the spare ticket she had as one of her family members

20:08.160 --> 20:09.840
when I was not able to make it.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.920
Before I could consider the consequences of doing so,

20:11.920 --> 20:13.120
I graciously accepted,

20:13.120 --> 20:14.640
and she sat me among her family members

20:14.640 --> 20:17.360
in the second row of the stage for very intimate to our concert.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.880
Because of the proximity of the stage,

20:18.880 --> 20:20.880
I'm worried these were rather expensive tickets.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.920
Should I try to compensate her somehow?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.320
She also invited me to her church.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.760
Do I have to start going there?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.240
Do I need to buy her a ticket to something now?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.560
That's from a ticket tag along in Texas.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.240
I don't even think,

20:34.240 --> 20:36.640
how could you not tell us what the concert was?

20:36.640 --> 20:38.960
I thought that was gonna be the whole thing.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.480
I'm so disappointed.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.440
Yeah.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.800
James Taylor.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.400
The church thing, probably not.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.320
I think you're okay, I think you're okay.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.920
That's a big decision for a person to make,

20:47.920 --> 20:50.720
and I do not think you can be bought into it

20:50.720 --> 20:53.760
by second row tickets for a James Taylor concert.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.080
After all that James Taylor concert,

20:56.080 --> 20:57.360
you got plenty of church in you

20:57.360 --> 20:59.040
just from that right there, I promise.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.120
Do you need to buy tickets?

21:01.120 --> 21:03.200
Do you need to buy her a ticket?

21:03.200 --> 21:03.840
Here's the thing.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.400
At the moment that ticket entered your possession,

21:08.400 --> 21:11.760
one second before that exchange happened,

21:11.760 --> 21:14.400
that ticket's value was zero

21:14.400 --> 21:16.880
because it was not going to be used, right?

21:16.880 --> 21:19.360
Like if I have a gumball

21:19.360 --> 21:21.120
and I was gonna throw it on the ground

21:21.120 --> 21:24.480
as hard as I possibly can as a joke,

21:24.480 --> 21:26.480
and then I saw Travis and I was like,

21:26.480 --> 21:27.440
you want this gumball?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.320
It's no longer the 25 cents I spent for the gumball.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.640
It's valueless because I decided it had no value

21:32.640 --> 21:34.000
because I was gonna throw it on the ground.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.280
Does that make sense?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.960
Yes, but I also think, Griffin,

21:37.680 --> 21:40.640
this person welcomed you into their family,

21:40.640 --> 21:43.920
probably shared some James Taylor branded popcorn with you,

21:46.080 --> 21:48.880
fire and rain and butter and salt, and that was-

21:48.880 --> 21:50.560
That's probably, we could probably do better.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.720
I know, but there's no time.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.320
And so they shared that experience with you,

21:56.320 --> 21:59.200
and now even I think what you're feeling,

21:59.200 --> 22:01.040
question asker, is a bond,

22:01.040 --> 22:02.800
and you want to break that with money,

22:02.800 --> 22:04.240
and I get that.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.400
You feel like you owe them something.

22:06.400 --> 22:10.080
Maybe just hand her a 20 and walk away.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.280
I feel like you went to a concert,

22:13.280 --> 22:15.520
going to a concert without knowing

22:15.520 --> 22:17.520
what concert you're going to see

22:18.240 --> 22:22.400
is the single wildest act I have ever heard

22:22.400 --> 22:23.920
of any human doing.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.800
That would be akin to mailing $100 to Amazon

22:28.800 --> 22:30.880
and saying, eh, whatever, surprise me,

22:32.560 --> 22:35.520
and make me, I'll video myself opening it,

22:35.520 --> 22:36.800
and you can watch my reaction.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.560
It's insane.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.880
You deserve the worst that life has to offer you, but-

22:43.200 --> 22:44.240
It's like going to a museum

22:44.240 --> 22:45.520
without knowing if they have laser tag.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.320
Like, come on.

22:46.320 --> 22:46.800
Exactly.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.240
I will say this.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.280
You went there to open yourself up

22:51.280 --> 22:53.200
to the adventure of life,

22:53.200 --> 22:55.520
one of the many wonderful adventures

22:55.520 --> 22:56.960
this world has in store for us,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.280
and it seems like the door has been open

22:59.280 --> 23:02.160
to a story where maybe you find a family

23:02.160 --> 23:04.400
that has always wanted a child like yourself,

23:05.040 --> 23:09.040
and you find renewal in the blood of Jesus Christ

23:09.040 --> 23:11.200
or something, and it's like your story

23:11.200 --> 23:14.880
that you started with this random thing,

23:14.880 --> 23:16.640
and now you're just gonna close the door on it.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.520
I think you need to repay these people

23:19.520 --> 23:21.120
by becoming a part of their family,

23:21.120 --> 23:23.200
like a surrogate member of their family.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.000
Be there at Thanksgiving, at Easter, whatever.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.160
Whatever they like it or not.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.080
Yeah, you're gonna repay them somehow

23:30.080 --> 23:31.520
until one of them, you know,

23:31.520 --> 23:32.800
they'll become a moment when they need

23:32.800 --> 23:33.600
a ticket for something,

23:33.600 --> 23:35.600
and then you can get the hell out of Dodge.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.920
Yeah, and then you're free.

23:37.920 --> 23:38.560
Ah, shoot.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.440
I really would love to go see Kings of Leon.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.400
Oh, cool.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.840
I got you a ticket for that.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.200
Bye, fuckos!

23:45.200 --> 23:47.200
Dude, we spent three Christmases together.

23:47.200 --> 23:47.760
Are you sure?

23:47.760 --> 23:48.160
Yes!

23:49.200 --> 23:50.400
Genie, I'm free!

23:50.400 --> 23:51.360
Whoosh!

23:52.320 --> 23:53.280
Hey, Brittany!

23:53.280 --> 23:54.880
We all hate Dylan!

23:54.880 --> 23:55.520
What's up?

23:55.520 --> 23:55.760
Bye!

23:55.760 --> 23:56.080
I'm out!

23:56.800 --> 23:58.480
We hated him the whole time!

23:58.480 --> 24:00.480
Hey, Kevin, your haircut sucks!

24:02.160 --> 24:05.280
I didn't like that sweater you knitted me for Christmas.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.480
Y'all want a quick Yahoo?

24:06.480 --> 24:06.960
Yeah.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.080
Yeah, I think so, Griff.

24:08.080 --> 24:08.320
Okay.

24:08.320 --> 24:08.720
I think so.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.400
Here's one from Drew Davenport, level 9000.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.400
Yeah, Drew, Drew, Drew, Drew.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.000
It's from Yajuransersuser.

24:14.000 --> 24:14.880
They're anonymous too.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.600
I'm gonna call them.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.120
Bartholomew asks, did cavemen go to school?

24:20.800 --> 24:21.840
Did cavemen go to school?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.440
Not in the traditional sense, I think.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.440
Probably not in the school school as we know school.

24:25.440 --> 24:30.080
I think school probably didn't get invented until more recently, I'm thinking.

24:30.080 --> 24:35.440
But did cavemen have a school-like system where they could share?

24:35.440 --> 24:36.320
Like a cave school?

24:37.760 --> 24:38.160
I think they-

24:38.160 --> 24:40.000
Where they sat at like rock desks?

24:41.120 --> 24:44.080
You would assume some sort of hunting apprenticeship, right?

24:44.640 --> 24:48.240
But that would be, I feel like cumbersome,

24:48.240 --> 24:51.760
because you have one dude who's like great at hunting,

24:51.760 --> 24:55.600
and all the kids would want to train with him.

24:55.600 --> 24:55.840
Yeah.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.280
So he would need to maybe educate them en masse,

24:59.280 --> 25:01.280
which I feel like is all we're talking about, right?

25:01.280 --> 25:04.720
Like here's how you beat a velociraptor.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.160
Yeah, and they use pens made out of dinosaur bones.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, they would use pens out of dinosaur bones with dinosaur blood ink.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Maybe like books that are just big leaves all stuck together.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.480
Yeah, their books would be big leaves, and they wouldn't have iPads.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.880
They would have rocks.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.600
Rocks.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.560
That can be funny.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.000
Big, flat rocks.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.920
They'd be like, oh, this is my tablet, but it's just like a stone tablet.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.320
I'm writing this down for the cavemen, the Geico Cavemen comic series.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep that in mind.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.920
Oh, wait, stop, stop, shut up.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.000
School clubs.

25:41.520 --> 25:41.840
Okay.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.120
Okay, I'm fine.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.560
Because they're cavemen.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.520
Yeah, I don't think I deserve that.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.720
They can be a drama club, but it's an actual club.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.840
Okay.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.720
And it says drama on it.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.520
Okay.

25:53.520 --> 25:57.280
Glee club, but it's a club that says glee on it.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.960
All right, I don't know why you said shut up, though.

25:59.840 --> 26:04.080
Yeah, I had this perfect joke, Griffin, and I was afraid it wouldn't.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.640
It says swim team, but they do it in a tar pit.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.040
Yes, yes, yes.

26:09.040 --> 26:13.120
Oh, and at lunch, they just get a big side of brontosaurus ribs.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.880
Okay, so, okay, listen.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.720
It tips their car over.

26:16.720 --> 26:21.040
When the cavemen invented the wheel, did everyone else just immediately agree like,

26:21.040 --> 26:22.080
yeah, that's better?

26:22.080 --> 26:25.040
Or did they have to take some time and be like, is this better?

26:26.800 --> 26:27.440
Is it good?

26:28.320 --> 26:28.960
Fire.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.880
I mean, it's warm, it's bright.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.920
There is just nothing funny about cavemen.

26:33.920 --> 26:38.320
And it makes me wonder why they decided to do a whole situation comedy about it.

26:38.320 --> 26:42.080
You heard me say drama club, but it's a club, right?

26:42.080 --> 26:43.600
That was more amusing.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.040
That was more Reader's Digest, like a real toilet thinker.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.800
It wasn't a real gut buster that I expect from a mad magazine.

26:53.440 --> 26:58.160
So, yeah, I'm sorry for this one, guys.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.360
I would like to take a moment.

27:02.160 --> 27:07.840
I've been led onto the internet, and I know that we need to do the Money Zone and everything,

27:07.840 --> 27:12.800
but I'd like to take a moment to talk about the TV series, Cavemen,

27:12.800 --> 27:16.800
and the things that I've learned about it on the Wikipedia page.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.520
And I know what you're thinking.

27:19.520 --> 27:26.000
A sitcom that is about the Geico Cavemen that briefly aired in 2007.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.160
It doesn't seem all that funny, but listen to this description from the synopsis.

27:34.160 --> 27:38.080
Cavemen have prominent brow ridges and more body hair than homo sapiens,

27:38.080 --> 27:40.640
but beyond superficial differences in appearance,

27:40.640 --> 27:42.960
they actually are not that much different from modern humans

27:42.960 --> 27:44.720
in terms of behavior or physical abilities.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.920
Male cavemen are very hairy, have thick long beards, and wear their hair shoulder length.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.720
A cavewoman that appeared on the show also had a prominent brow ridge

27:52.720 --> 27:55.440
and comparatively more body hair than a modern human female.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.240
Some cavemen attempted to pass as homo sapiens.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.000
This is for about the series.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.160
Some cavemen attempted to pass as homo sapiens by shaving their body hair.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.840
Other cavemen called them shavers.

28:07.840 --> 28:13.520
The central humor of the show is that cavemen characters are not brutish primates,

28:13.520 --> 28:16.480
but fully integrated into white collar jobs.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.760
The central cavemen characters are modern city dwellers.

28:19.760 --> 28:27.200
They must endure racial epithets such as mager, a pun based on Cro-Magnon.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.400
Oh my God.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.640
Fuck this is funny.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.720
Damn, I'm laughing already.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.360
And that's before I get to the last line of the synopsis.

28:35.360 --> 28:39.920
According to producer Joe Lawson, the show was originally going to be set in Newport News

28:39.920 --> 28:41.840
due to its proximity to the water.

28:41.840 --> 28:45.600
Then the setting changed to Atlanta, Georgia, and finally San Diego, California.

28:46.160 --> 28:49.920
The 13 episodes of this series were made.

28:50.800 --> 28:58.000
The final six did not air on traditional television.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
And if you can do a little math, that means that cavemen got seven episodes,

29:04.000 --> 29:15.120
which is again, one more episode, one more episode than our TV show.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.480
But good news is all the episodes aired in Australia.

29:21.120 --> 29:25.200
I always said they should have done a show about the talking stack of dollar bills.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.120
Cause that's fun.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.640
Cause that one's funny.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.960
And they could have called it the money zone.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.520
Yeah, the gecko's pretty good too.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.320
Oh, that was a transition.

29:34.320 --> 29:34.720
Fuck, sorry.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.720
Transition, fuck.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.320
Well, I'm going to talk about Squarespace now.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.960
You've got a great idea somewhere inside you.

29:50.960 --> 29:56.720
I believe that all people are formed by their life experience to put something,

29:56.720 --> 29:59.360
anything into the world that only they can create.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.080
Are you talking about me?

30:00.080 --> 30:02.240
Right now, right now.

30:02.240 --> 30:06.160
Yes, Travis, even you right now, that flame lies buried within you

30:06.160 --> 30:08.000
and there is a way to unlock it.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.760
Friends, I am Justin McElroy and I'm ready to unlock the power within you

30:13.760 --> 30:17.680
by harnessing the creative energy of Squarespace.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.720
Are you still talking about me?

30:19.920 --> 30:20.960
Still about you, Travis.

30:20.960 --> 30:25.840
This is direct conduit from your heart and your mind into the computer.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.280
It will turn your dreams and your imaginations into emotions

30:29.280 --> 30:34.240
that can be seen on any computer screen, but not just phones.

30:35.040 --> 30:35.280
What?

30:35.280 --> 30:36.320
Like in Lawn Mower Man?

30:36.960 --> 30:38.560
Just like in Lawn Mower Man.

30:38.560 --> 30:43.200
And these aren't just on screens, phones too.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.520
They're designed for mobile from the ground up.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.960
They're going to help you design a website to showcase your work,

30:48.960 --> 30:51.040
promote your business.

30:51.040 --> 30:55.840
And now it's an upcoming event or special project like a reboot of Caveman.

30:55.840 --> 31:00.480
There's got beautiful customizable templates created by world-class designers.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.400
I don't know why they need to be customizable though

31:02.400 --> 31:04.160
if they're created by world-class designers.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.680
But you shouldn't fuck with them.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.360
Maybe they put a lot of work into them.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.720
You should just use them like they are.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.760
And there's e-commerce functionality too.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.160
So make your dream stand out.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.280
Make it stand out.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.360
Stand out with a beautiful website from Squarespace.

31:19.360 --> 31:25.040

Plug your brain and heart into a computer and let your dreams become a website, TM.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.040
That's really nice.

31:40.160 --> 31:40.880
Is that a poem?

31:40.880 --> 31:42.000
Is that a poem?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.440
Yes, because it's meant to sell something.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.080
There's a purpose.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.120
Ah, perfect.

31:45.120 --> 31:50.880
Justin, speaking of domains, could I have lilyisaveverygoodgirl.com back now?

31:50.880 --> 31:53.600
Or where are we at on that?

31:53.600 --> 31:54.480
I'll tell you what, Trav.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.680
If you get into Supernatural Season 15, I'll give you the URL back.

31:57.680 --> 31:58.480
Okay, there we go.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.840
I want to tell you about Stitch Fix.

32:00.800 --> 32:06.720
I have had a 100% hit rate with Stitch Fix for the last couple months.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.160
Stitch Fix, you go in, you tell them what your style is.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.080
They even show you some different options and say, do you like this?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.280
What about this?

32:15.280 --> 32:16.560
Is this something you would wear?

32:16.560 --> 32:20.720
You also could tell them what you'd be willing to pay for a pair of shoes or a shirt,

32:21.360 --> 32:22.640
where you would wear the clothes.

32:22.640 --> 32:27.360
And then they send you a box of, I would say, super high quality,

32:28.000 --> 32:33.040
amazingly tailored to your style clothing and not just like shirts and pants.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.600
I've also gotten, you know, shoes.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.960
I've gotten hats.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.200
I've gotten really cool stuff from them.

32:40.080 --> 32:40.800
Jackets.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.520
Oh, I got this jacket in my last one that has just instantly become a favorite

32:45.520 --> 32:49.760
because you work with a personal stylist who gets to know you and what you want.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.200

33:03.760 --> 33:07.200
Hi, it's Ali Kokash, one of the cast members of Mission to Zix,

33:07.200 --> 33:09.360
a new addition to the Max Fun Network.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.240
We're blown away by the welcome we've received from Max Fun listeners,

33:12.240 --> 33:15.280
telling us you've discovered the show and are binging it hard,

33:15.280 --> 33:18.960
supporting us during the drive and just being rad humans all around.

33:18.960 --> 33:23.040
Mission to Zix is an improvised, obsessively sound designed sci-fi comedy epic

33:23.040 --> 33:26.480
following a group of ambassadors as they explore the ass end of space.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.080
I play Dar, the 12 foot tall,

33:28.080 --> 33:31.920
omnisexual security officer with furry scales, chest talons,

33:31.920 --> 33:33.920
and a series of flaps and chutes that are for...

33:34.720 --> 33:35.360
Yeah, you know what?

33:35.360 --> 33:36.080
You'll figure it out.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.320
We'd be delighted if you joined our crew aboard the aging sentient starship,

33:40.320 --> 33:42.880
the Bargerian Jade, as we travel the Zix Quadrant,

33:42.880 --> 33:46.400
meeting all sorts of weird aliens played by brilliant guest comedians.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.200
That's Mission to Zix, Z-Y-X-X.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.080
Question.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.760
Another question.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.760
Here we go, another question.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.160
Coming at you.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.120
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.240
Oh my God, Justin.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.560
I'm interrupting myself this time because I thought that was more polite.

34:06.560 --> 34:06.800
Yeah.

34:06.800 --> 34:11.680
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

34:11.680 --> 34:12.880
I want a munch.

34:12.880 --> 34:13.360
Quad.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.440
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

34:15.440 --> 34:19.120
I've got some drainage and I want too much.

34:19.120 --> 34:19.960
Squad.

34:20.860 --> 34:23.080
And it's messing up my voice.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.240
Quick update.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.360
Don't do the Duncan Shoes, I did the Duncan Shoes.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.200
Quick update before we get in.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.440
Welcome to the family.

34:30.440 --> 34:35.080
Fresh and Co. launching a cannabis-focused menu.

34:35.080 --> 34:39.620
It's a special 420 hemp and CBD-infused menu

34:39.620 --> 34:41.680
that launches exclusively on Fresh and Co. app

34:41.680 --> 34:43.520
on April 9th, you fucked up.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.760
We'll be in restaurants from April 12th through April 30th.

34:46.760 --> 34:50.400
Fresh and Co. executive Craig Rispoli

34:50.400 --> 34:51.760
curated the menu in collaboration

34:51.760 --> 34:54.520
with Jeepney's chef Miguel Trinidad.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.840
And just so you're plugged into where the scene is at,

34:57.840 --> 34:59.680
they got the half-baked shrimp salad,

34:59.680 --> 35:01.960
which is hemp cakes, hemp mixed greens,

35:01.960 --> 35:04.000
sea beans, red onion, whatever.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
There's CBD-infused ginger cashew aioli on that.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.240
Good.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.340
There's a blazed beet sandwich.

35:12.340 --> 35:16.680
Again, this is CBD, folks, and hemp,

35:16.680 --> 35:19.040
which they can make ropes out of.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.760
These sandwiches will not get you high.

35:20.760 --> 35:21.600
They're not gonna get you high.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.520
I wish to God these companies would stop making sandwiches

35:24.520 --> 35:26.120
pretending they're gonna get you high.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.500
I see.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.220
I wanna talk very quickly about Topper's Pizza,

35:31.220 --> 35:33.640
which just added pretzel bites to its value menu.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.480
I've never been to a Topper's Pizza,

35:35.480 --> 35:37.040
and I don't know anyone who has,

35:37.040 --> 35:38.960
but I feel like I've learned a lot about Topper's Pizza,

35:38.960 --> 35:42.680
namely that the person they talk to,

35:42.680 --> 35:43.840
namely the president,

35:43.840 --> 35:45.560
doesn't give a shit about these pretzels.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.520
This is a good obby.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.160
Topper's Pizza's continued its commitment

35:49.160 --> 35:51.320
to great pizza and quality offerings,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.340
all at an affordable price,

35:53.340 --> 35:56.840
thanks to the launch of its newest value item, pretzel bites.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.340
Built on the belief that better doesn't have to cost more,

35:59.340 --> 36:01.560
in the words of founder and president of Topper's Pizza,

36:01.560 --> 36:02.960
Scott Gittrich.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.800
The brand rolled out a pick any two or more from-

36:04.800 --> 36:06.840
Scott Gittrich?

36:06.840 --> 36:09.280
Scott Gittrich.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.800
That's not, that's a fake person's name.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.000
His name's Scott Gittrich.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.300
President Scott is the CEO.

36:17.420 --> 36:20.680
The 5.99 value menu lets customers choose

36:20.680 --> 36:23.080
any two of the following, baked mac and cheese,

36:23.080 --> 36:26.240
gooey monkey bread, half pound orders of boneless wings,

36:26.240 --> 36:28.800
and single orders of topper sticks,

36:28.800 --> 36:31.360
plus any medium, two topping pizza.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.640
Folks, if you wanna put weed into food,

36:33.640 --> 36:35.200
that's your route right there.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.520
That's where you're gonna put weed in.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.720
I know what it is, and I do enjoy it,

36:39.720 --> 36:43.240
but hearing the phrase gooey monkey bread is like-

36:43.240 --> 36:44.500
Yeah, it's rough.

36:44.500 --> 36:48.440
It's upsetting, it's viscerally upsetting.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.720
So these Topper's pretzel bites are snack-ready morsels

36:51.720 --> 36:55.260
fried to perfection and dusted with sea salt,

36:55.260 --> 36:56.520
in case you're curious.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.300
This is one of the weirder lines.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.440
Customers can pick from any dipping sauce

37:02.440 --> 37:04.560
with nacho cheese, the brand's favorite.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.000
Oh.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.160
That's exactly what it says.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.080
With nacho cheese, the brand's favorite.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.040
5.99 value item includes 12 pretzel bites.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.020
And so they come to Scott Get Rich,

37:17.020 --> 37:21.120
and they say, Scott, Scott, give me a quote, Scott.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.080
We need a quote.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.360
This press release is going out hot.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.700
Give me a quote for the pretzel bites press release.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.160
For almost 30 years, we've been relentlessly committed

37:32.160 --> 37:35.480
to doing pizza better, says Scott Get Rich.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.920
That means our fans shouldn't compromise on quality

37:37.920 --> 37:40.180
in pursuit of affordability.

37:40.180 --> 37:42.680
Our ever-expanding value menu reflects that.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.480
Scott. Scott.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.320
How do you begin with, we are relentlessly committed

37:48.320 --> 37:50.240
to doing pizza better, and your next sentence is,

37:50.240 --> 37:52.260
and folks, we've strayed from the path.

37:52.260 --> 37:57.260
With these abominations that have nothing to do with pizza.

37:57.960 --> 38:01.400
Bread should not be bathed in an alkaline bath.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.960
It goes against my beliefs.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.800
So Scott Iverson, the VP of marketing for Topper's Pizza,

38:06.800 --> 38:09.660
busts in the room, and he's like, wait, Scott,

38:09.660 --> 38:13.600
hey, it's me, nice Scott, and that quote was terrible.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.860
Here, I'm gonna get people horny for pretzels.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.080
Not again. You were good, Scott.

38:18.080 --> 38:21.740
You've twisted my bread dreams.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.360
We work tirelessly to make sure our pizza lovers

38:25.360 --> 38:27.540
enjoy a variety of complimentary options

38:27.540 --> 38:30.200
that we develop after closely attending to the data.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.720
What?

38:31.720 --> 38:32.560
What data?

38:32.560 --> 38:35.680
We work tirelessly to make sure our pizza lovers

38:35.680 --> 38:37.960
enjoy a variety of complimentary options

38:37.960 --> 38:41.080
that we develop after closely attending to the data.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.720
What the living fuck, Scott?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.360
What are you talking about?

38:44.360 --> 38:46.200
Man, I'm hungry for pretzel bites.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.320
Do you know a good place?

38:47.320 --> 38:50.380
Well, we make good pizza and look at data.

38:50.380 --> 38:51.960
Do you want some of these?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.960
Every time you order a Topper's Pizza,

38:53.960 --> 38:56.840
as you open the box, someone rises up from behind your couch

38:56.840 --> 39:00.120
like, don't mind me, just observing the data.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.560
I'm minding the data on this.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.120
I think of myself as something of an appetizer sommelier.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.800
So it looks like you're having a sausage and mushroom,

39:06.800 --> 39:08.680
might I suggest, the fried pretzel bites.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.800
Mm-hmm.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.240
They are dusted with sea salt.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.120
And now, fill out this form.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.000
My favorite dusting, my favorite dipping

39:15.000 --> 39:17.520
is the nacho cheese, of course.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.120
It's the restaurant's favorite.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.160
It doesn't matter what you like.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.240
We've attended to the data.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.640
It's all of your favorites.

39:24.140 --> 39:26.220
Anyway, I will now read a question.

39:26.220 --> 39:28.920
I was working the ticket counter at my university theater

39:28.920 --> 39:31.540
when a man approached, this is a very performing arts

39:31.540 --> 39:32.800
centric episode, isn't it?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.420
It's very arts, arts heavy.

39:34.420 --> 39:35.520
Not just performing arts.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.080
The first question about art, it's about the arts.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.120
I was working the ticket counter

39:39.120 --> 39:40.880
at my university theater when a man approached the counter

39:40.880 --> 39:44.700
and said, stone cold, I'm just gonna bust in.

39:44.700 --> 39:47.140
Walked into the theater unchallenged.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.760
How could I have stopped him?

39:49.760 --> 39:52.400
That's from steamrolled at the Sing-a-rama.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.240
My friend, I don't think you could have.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.880
He did say very clearly he was gonna bust in.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.280
He stated his intention

39:58.280 --> 40:00.200
and he completed his objective.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.320
It's not a crime if you warn him.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.480
That is true.

40:03.480 --> 40:04.400
And what's this crime evil?

40:04.400 --> 40:05.240
What is the crime?

40:05.240 --> 40:06.360
What are you gonna get tried for in this?

40:06.360 --> 40:09.560
And I hate to revert to shoplifting is cool, Griffin,

40:09.560 --> 40:13.120
but like it's not shoplifting this one.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.680
You can't shoplift a beautiful performance

40:15.680 --> 40:17.900
from David Hyde Pierce at the Broadway.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.940
Like you can't, David Hyde Pierce isn't gonna be like,

40:20.940 --> 40:25.940
hey, give me my performance back that I did in show.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.220
Right, it's impossible to imagine

40:29.220 --> 40:34.220
that we have gone this far in the history of the arts

40:35.220 --> 40:37.580
and have not come up with a countermeasure

40:37.580 --> 40:40.380
for I'm just gonna bust in.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.060
No one's ever thought of this.

40:42.060 --> 40:45.300
Like Broadway, Hamilton tickets are real tough to get.

40:45.300 --> 40:46.460
I've got a solution.

40:46.460 --> 40:47.820
I'm just gonna bust in.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.080
I'll go.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.300
And you know what?

40:50.300 --> 40:51.700
If I sit in someone's seat,

40:51.700 --> 40:53.340
cause I already bought it, you know what I'll tell them?

40:53.340 --> 40:54.540
Sit somewhere else.

40:54.540 --> 40:55.380
Yeah.

40:55.380 --> 40:56.780
I bust it in.

40:56.780 --> 41:00.080
Or I'll just get up and move to the next empty seat I see

41:00.080 --> 41:02.260
and just keep doing that

41:02.260 --> 41:04.940
until I get to stay in a seat the whole time.

41:04.940 --> 41:05.780
Yeah.

41:05.780 --> 41:06.600
Or I'll stand in the back.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.440
I bust it in.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.660
You've got nothing on me.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.660
You have no way to track me.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.480
I'm off the grid.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.940
I'm a self-made man.

41:12.940 --> 41:15.100
And if you're watching this show,

41:15.100 --> 41:16.720
you'll learn that those are good.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.560
Yeah.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.380
So I'm kinda like the-

41:18.380 --> 41:19.620
Hamilton would've stood in the aisle.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.540
I'm the Hamilton of this theater.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.580
If you think about it, really.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.860
Would the Phantom of the Opera sit in a seat

41:25.860 --> 41:28.700
or would he lurk in the back as I am doing?

41:28.700 --> 41:29.700
Yeah, look at me now.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.140
I'm trying to catch you, but I can't

41:31.140 --> 41:32.380
cause I'm so slippery.

41:32.380 --> 41:35.820
Just like Rummy Tumbles, the cat.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.700
Rumbly Tumblies.

41:37.700 --> 41:40.160
Rambletumbles.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.400
Here's what you can do to someone who announces

41:42.400 --> 41:44.020
that they're just gonna bust in.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.660
You could say, I'd prefer you didn't.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.260
You could try that.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.680
This is something my daughter is taking to do.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.820
Say, I'm just gonna bust in.

41:51.820 --> 41:54.380
And you just say, no.

41:54.380 --> 41:55.220
No.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.040
And it's a strong-

41:56.040 --> 41:56.880
And then they'll do it anyway.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.420
Yeah, but it's a strong response.

41:58.420 --> 41:59.660
That happens when you look at BB

41:59.660 --> 42:00.900
and it's like, well, nap time.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.180
And she just says, no.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.860
And it's kind of irrefutable.

42:05.860 --> 42:09.180
Once they get in there, you can't stop the show

42:09.180 --> 42:11.020
to get the performance burglar.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.500
You can't do it.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.740
You could call the cops and it's gonna go like this.

42:14.740 --> 42:15.980
Hi, this is the cops.

42:15.980 --> 42:17.440
What's your emergency?

42:18.560 --> 42:19.720
Well, they busted in.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.560
Yeah.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.380
What do you want us to do?

42:21.380 --> 42:22.700
It sounds like they're already in.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.420
This happened one time when I was at CSC

42:25.420 --> 42:27.620
and a person walked in,

42:27.620 --> 42:30.940
I think it was like 10 minutes into the start of act one

42:30.940 --> 42:33.260
and made eye contact with the person at the front

42:33.260 --> 42:35.980
and just nodded as if I've been in.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.020
And the person in the front went, uh, what?

42:38.020 --> 42:39.320
And immediately reacted.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.180
But the person, the guy who walked in

42:41.180 --> 42:44.500
just kept walking down the aisle to backstage

42:44.500 --> 42:46.940
and then just stood in the backstage looking around

42:46.940 --> 42:48.800
and then turned back and left.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.700
Yowch.

42:49.700 --> 42:50.540
That's not great.

42:50.540 --> 42:52.980
You used to work at the marquee cinemas, right?

42:52.980 --> 42:54.060
Yes.

42:54.060 --> 42:58.780
Were you given any protocol for I'm just gonna bust in?

42:58.780 --> 42:59.620
No.

42:59.620 --> 43:00.580
And you know what?

43:00.580 --> 43:02.180
I don't think I would have noticed.

43:02.180 --> 43:03.960
Yeah, I'm just gonna bust in.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.100
Don't.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.940
No, I'm going anyway.

43:06.940 --> 43:10.060
I want to see the show and I don't wanna pay for it.

43:10.060 --> 43:11.140
I'm gonna bust in now.

43:11.140 --> 43:12.020
Please don't.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.660
You know what's fucked up?

43:13.660 --> 43:16.320
I've been sitting here trying to think of something to say

43:16.320 --> 43:19.060
and I just now realized that everything I've been trying

43:19.060 --> 43:22.100
to think up is good ways to bust in.

43:22.100 --> 43:22.940
And.

43:22.940 --> 43:23.760
And.

43:23.760 --> 43:24.600
And.

43:24.600 --> 43:27.060
Because I was just thinking about saying out loud,

43:27.060 --> 43:30.220
you dress up in all black and you put on a headset

43:30.220 --> 43:33.220
and you carry around a, you know, a three ring binder

43:33.220 --> 43:34.940
and you just walk into it really quickly.

43:34.940 --> 43:36.620
You can give them like a, hold on, hold on finger

43:36.620 --> 43:38.140
if they start to talk to you.

43:38.140 --> 43:40.580
Because they don't know who, you might be stage manager.

43:40.580 --> 43:41.420
That's true.

43:41.420 --> 43:42.240
You might be trying to stage managing

43:42.240 --> 43:43.820
and you need to be up there.

43:43.820 --> 43:48.580
I don't, I feel like if you sneak in, you'll be arrested.

43:48.580 --> 43:51.180
I think that is a crime to sneak in.

43:51.180 --> 43:53.260
I don't want anybody sneaking in.

43:53.260 --> 43:56.040
I wanna push against this nation's inability

43:56.040 --> 43:58.660
to stop people who are just gonna bust in.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.740
We're performing arts.

43:59.740 --> 44:02.460
I think if you, if you rolled up to,

44:02.460 --> 44:03.700
let's go back to Hamilton.

44:03.700 --> 44:07.100
If you rolled up to a matinee of Hamilton dressed.

44:07.100 --> 44:08.580
I can't afford it, Trav.

44:08.580 --> 44:12.100
No, Justin, you're dressed as Hamilton.

44:12.100 --> 44:12.940
Oh.

44:12.940 --> 44:14.900
And you're gonna bust in and you're gonna say,

44:14.900 --> 44:18.420
I'm going to bust in in like a Hamilton accent.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.540
And like at that point, everyone's like,

44:20.540 --> 44:21.680
this is part of it.

44:22.780 --> 44:25.860
This is, this show kicks ass.

44:25.860 --> 44:28.620
It starts even before you get into the theater.

44:28.620 --> 44:30.420
Yours is, yours is too stealthy still.

44:30.420 --> 44:32.460
I feel like to maintain the bust in,

44:32.460 --> 44:35.660
cause that's so important, bust in makes Justin feel good,

44:35.660 --> 44:38.340
is you dress up like Alexander Hamilton

44:38.340 --> 44:41.700
and then you bust in, charge the stage,

44:41.700 --> 44:46.620
grab the real Hamilton and you two spin around real fast.

44:46.620 --> 44:48.140
Okay, don't do that.

44:48.140 --> 44:52.580
But then they don't, and then you say, arrest who?

44:52.580 --> 44:55.880
Which, okay, okay, ask me something

44:55.880 --> 44:57.560
only the real Hamilton would know.

44:57.560 --> 44:58.500
That kind of thing.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.060
You gotta bone up before you go in.

45:00.060 --> 45:02.740
Which number president were you?

45:02.740 --> 45:03.780
14.

45:03.780 --> 45:05.380
Fuck, damn it.

45:05.380 --> 45:07.140
No, got it in one.

45:07.140 --> 45:08.580
And then they take you to jail and you say,

45:08.580 --> 45:09.740
I'm gonna bust out.

45:10.820 --> 45:11.660
And they're like, damn it,

45:11.660 --> 45:12.900
why haven't we thought about something?

45:12.900 --> 45:14.660
Damn it, Bim Bam, I'm a prison warden.

45:14.660 --> 45:17.860
These dang guys keep slipping on dang through.

45:17.860 --> 45:21.980
Do you guys know how just like existentially fucked it is

45:21.980 --> 45:24.540
that we have now spent, I don't know, six minutes

45:24.540 --> 45:26.980
talking about other fun ways to do the crime

45:26.980 --> 45:29.000
and other cool places to do it?

45:29.000 --> 45:29.840
Yeah.

45:29.840 --> 45:30.660
I don't know what to tell you,

45:30.660 --> 45:32.540
cause the answer for the question that we received

45:32.540 --> 45:34.940
is CalTrips, and I wanted to make some jokes

45:34.940 --> 45:36.980
before we landed on the obvious answer of CalTrips.

45:36.980 --> 45:38.700
This is a thing I think about,

45:38.700 --> 45:41.980
like how much stuff we all kind of just do

45:41.980 --> 45:44.280
because we know we're not supposed to do it.

45:44.280 --> 45:47.400
Like, you know, I have a running joke with Teresa

45:47.400 --> 45:50.660
every time like a check comes for a meal,

45:50.660 --> 45:52.620
I just look at her and like kind of quietly say like,

45:52.620 --> 45:54.900
so done and dash.

45:54.900 --> 45:58.740
But then I think like, people then like just leave your table

45:58.740 --> 46:00.780
and you could just get up and leave.

46:00.780 --> 46:01.620
Like- But you shouldn't.

46:01.620 --> 46:03.360
You shouldn't, listen, you should not do that

46:03.360 --> 46:04.340
and don't do it.

46:04.340 --> 46:06.300
But there are things that we don't do

46:06.300 --> 46:08.300
because everybody just knows that they're like

46:08.300 --> 46:09.300
the wrong thing to do.

46:09.300 --> 46:12.940
And one of those is, I'm just gonna bust in.

46:12.940 --> 46:15.460
So it feels like the thing to do to stop that is,

46:15.460 --> 46:19.020
I don't know, better education in schools maybe.

46:19.020 --> 46:19.980
Well, I don't know.

46:19.980 --> 46:22.660
Just every time you turn in a ticket to any event

46:22.660 --> 46:24.180
to a ticket changer, take a moment,

46:24.180 --> 46:26.580
look at them in the eyes and share a moment

46:26.580 --> 46:28.300
where the both of you just appreciate

46:28.300 --> 46:30.260
the long moral arc of the universe.

46:30.260 --> 46:31.340
Yes.

46:31.340 --> 46:32.180
How about a Yahoo?

46:32.180 --> 46:34.500
And say, I'm not going to bust in.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.260
Yes, I'm going- And they say thank you.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.660
I'm going to saunter in.

46:38.660 --> 46:40.860
Adrian Cal sent this in, it's from Yahoo Answers user,

46:40.860 --> 46:42.780
Johnson, who does ask,

46:42.780 --> 46:45.540
how to build a koi pond for cheap.

46:45.540 --> 46:46.380
Oh.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.300
I love these big guys.

46:49.300 --> 46:50.140
Pfft.

46:50.140 --> 46:52.860
This is me, this is Griffin saying.

46:52.860 --> 46:54.500
Griffin said that, I love these big guys.

46:54.500 --> 46:55.340
Okay.

46:55.340 --> 46:56.980
They're so fucking big.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.900
Every time I see a koi,

46:58.900 --> 47:01.340
and I do with alarming frequency,

47:01.340 --> 47:02.980
every time I see a koi, I forget,

47:02.980 --> 47:05.400
like, wowzers, you guys are so big.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.500
I feel so at peace looking at you in there.

47:08.460 --> 47:10.860
But I've got $3.

47:10.860 --> 47:12.020
Mm-hmm.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.900
And I want it to be like you're in a fancy bank

47:14.900 --> 47:16.500
when you walk by my-

47:16.500 --> 47:17.940
Yes.

47:17.940 --> 47:19.500
My house, or inside my house.

47:19.500 --> 47:23.580
I preferably it would be inside in my lobby,

47:23.580 --> 47:24.500
where the shoes live.

47:24.500 --> 47:28.000
Oh, well, I was just going to say, plug up your bathtub.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.540
No, no, no, because then it's only for the shitters

47:31.540 --> 47:33.180
who go in there to use the bathroom.

47:33.180 --> 47:35.380
I want everybody, I want where my shoes live,

47:35.380 --> 47:37.660
where I kick off my boots

47:37.660 --> 47:39.500
at the end of a hard day at the factory,

47:39.500 --> 47:41.860
I want there to be koi there instead.

47:41.860 --> 47:43.780
But again, I got like $3.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.780
Do you know what my problem is with koi?

47:45.780 --> 47:46.620
Yeah.

47:46.620 --> 47:48.180
They're always pretending to be shy.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.620
Nah.

47:50.620 --> 47:51.440
I don't think so.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.900
I checked, Trav, I don't think.

47:52.900 --> 47:54.980
Because they're being koi.

47:54.980 --> 47:57.700
Yeah, I don't actually think so on that.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.860
Here's one thing you could try is take all your koi

47:59.860 --> 48:02.220
to the local swimming pool and dump them in.

48:02.220 --> 48:03.100
They're fine.

48:03.100 --> 48:04.380
They live for this shit.

48:04.380 --> 48:05.780
That's the thing you don't know about koi.

48:05.780 --> 48:08.260
They're nasty and you can't kill them.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.380
People really like it when we get things wrong

48:10.380 --> 48:12.300
about fish care, so I just want to announce it.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.820
You can't throw your koi in the local swimming pool.

48:14.820 --> 48:17.620
And then you say, hey, nobody fucking swim in this.

48:17.620 --> 48:18.840
This is my koi pond.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.900
I just busted in and I threw all my fish in here

48:21.900 --> 48:23.700
and you can't do shit about it.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.980
And don't give me the sad eyes, they're fine.

48:26.980 --> 48:29.340
These things are nasty and they live for chlorine

48:29.340 --> 48:30.180
and they love it.

48:30.180 --> 48:31.400
How much are kiddie pools?

48:31.400 --> 48:34.420
Could you get a kiddie pool for like 10 bucks?

48:34.420 --> 48:35.260
You could.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.080
You know, Trav, I thought about that.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.580
That was the first thing I was about to say.

48:37.580 --> 48:40.300
And then I thought, well, that probably wouldn't work

48:40.300 --> 48:42.260
because you probably need to dig a hole for it.

48:42.260 --> 48:44.300
And it's like, okay, so you dig a hole for your koi pond

48:44.300 --> 48:46.220
and then you put the kiddie pool in

48:46.220 --> 48:48.420
and then maybe you put grass over it to kind of hide it.

48:48.420 --> 48:49.900
I was like, oh no, it's a good idea.

48:49.900 --> 48:52.740
Oh no, tragically.

48:52.740 --> 48:55.380
You could lay down some plastic bags to line it.

48:55.380 --> 48:56.900
Oh no, wait, that's a good idea.

48:56.900 --> 48:58.060
Wait, wait, no, get out.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.240
Oh shit, that's it, Trav.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.200
I want them in my house, right?

49:01.200 --> 49:03.500
And a kiddie pool buried in the ground, that's not great.

49:03.500 --> 49:07.600
But, but clear garbage bags that I fill with water

49:07.600 --> 49:10.740
and stuff one individual koi in before tying it up.

49:10.740 --> 49:13.700
And then I could just leave it in the living room

49:13.700 --> 49:16.440
like a beanbag chair that no one can ever sit on

49:16.440 --> 49:19.900
or else the consequences will be so dire.

49:19.900 --> 49:23.300
Oh my God, oh the consequences.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.900
Oh my God, they'd be so bad.

49:25.900 --> 49:28.060
Everything would be ruined.

49:29.060 --> 49:30.580
Including the koi.

49:30.580 --> 49:31.420
Everything.

49:31.420 --> 49:32.380
The koi's fucking fine.

49:32.380 --> 49:33.800
Don't worry about the koi, they're nasty.

49:33.800 --> 49:34.780
They live for it.

49:34.780 --> 49:38.520
Oh God, the terrible mess.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.900
The terrible mess.

49:39.900 --> 49:42.300
But then, but it would be badass though.

49:42.300 --> 49:43.860
It would look like a cool bank.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.260
Yeah, that's for me.

49:46.260 --> 49:47.520
That's the one for me.

49:48.660 --> 49:50.140
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week

49:50.140 --> 49:51.260
on my brother, my brother and me.

49:51.260 --> 49:53.540
We hope you've enjoyed yourself as much as we have.

49:53.540 --> 49:56.380
It's always a treat getting to spend some time with you.

49:56.380 --> 49:58.980
If you have four spare bucks this week,

49:58.980 --> 50:02.060
we would ask humbly that you go to your local comic book store

50:02.060 --> 50:05.940
and buy War of the Realms Journey into Mystery number one.

50:05.940 --> 50:07.940
I know it sounds like grade A nerd shit,

50:07.940 --> 50:10.460
but we wrote it and it's not, it's pretty good

50:10.460 --> 50:11.300
even if you don't read comics,

50:11.300 --> 50:13.460
I think you'll like it, it's pretty funny.

50:13.460 --> 50:16.180
Our daddy wrote it with us and we worked together.

50:16.180 --> 50:17.660
Actually, he did the bulk of the work.

50:17.660 --> 50:19.220
But we're taking the credit.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.300
Oh, we're taking the credit.

50:20.300 --> 50:22.080
That's the McElroy Family Crest.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.420
It's right on there, look it up.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.240
Also, we have.

50:24.240 --> 50:27.340
It's a cat stealing a cake from another cat.

50:27.340 --> 50:30.380
We also just announced like a shit ton

50:30.380 --> 50:34.300
of tour dates coming up for 2019.

50:34.300 --> 50:35.860
They went on sale last week,

50:35.860 --> 50:38.820
so hopefully they're either not sold out

50:38.820 --> 50:41.060
or you got your chance at those tickets.

50:41.060 --> 50:44.340
But if they're not sold out, go to McElroy.family,

50:44.340 --> 50:47.700
click on tours, there's a whole bunch all over the place.

50:47.700 --> 50:49.260
And if you're sitting there thinking,

50:49.260 --> 50:50.860
well, you're not coming to where I am,

50:50.860 --> 50:53.020
there's lots of places where people are

50:53.020 --> 50:54.620
and we can't go to all of them.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.500
But maybe if these tickets sell really well,

50:57.500 --> 51:00.020
we'll go to other places next year, who knows?

51:00.020 --> 51:00.860
Who knows?

51:00.860 --> 51:03.340
We're so wild and unpredictable.

51:03.340 --> 51:05.420
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

51:05.420 --> 51:06.260
for the use of our theme song,

51:06.260 --> 51:08.900
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed,

51:08.900 --> 51:12.540
which is a fantastic album and can I say, funtastic.

51:12.540 --> 51:14.620
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

51:14.620 --> 51:16.540

51:36.220 --> 51:37.060

It was sent in by Adrian Callas.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.560
Thanks, Adrian.

51:39.560 --> 51:42.460
It's yahoo answers user coolbirds who asks,

51:43.300 --> 51:46.700

What's an example of a game, Manolo?

52:38.220 --> 52:39.860
Pokemon or medication.

52:39.860 --> 52:40.780
How do you play that?

52:40.780 --> 52:43.300
You have to guess if something's a Pokemon name

52:43.300 --> 52:45.540
or a medication.

52:45.540 --> 52:46.660
