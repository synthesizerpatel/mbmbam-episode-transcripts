WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:02.260 --> 01:10.260
It's better with you

01:10.380 --> 01:17.100
Hello welcome my brother my brother me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

01:17.940 --> 01:24.140
I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy. Hey, what's up? So guys this morning? I was at the gym

01:24.420 --> 01:26.420
you know the the Iron Temple and

01:26.980 --> 01:29.780
I got a message from our

01:29.780 --> 01:35.800
Well the executive producer, I mean the producers all got together, but from mr. Jarmuson and

01:36.500 --> 01:39.700
They just sent over some studio. What was the name? Mr. Jarmuson

01:40.660 --> 01:44.060
Jarmuson did you say? Yeah, there's not as many vowels in it as you'd think and

01:44.620 --> 01:48.780
Mr. Jarmuson asked me to just go over these with you real quick

01:48.780 --> 01:53.140
So I figured we always have a little time in the intro where we don't really say anything funny

01:53.140 --> 01:56.740
So I just go ahead and get these out of the way here. Okay. Yeah. All right

01:56.740 --> 02:01.260
Uh Griffin right off the bat and they said that this is mostly a legal thing

02:01.780 --> 02:04.500
Yeah, now that you live in DC

02:04.940 --> 02:10.660
They've asked you to stop saying that you have a Texas size hunger for things. Oh, man

02:12.660 --> 02:15.580
You can't do that anymore but I mean that my hunger

02:16.100 --> 02:21.460
Was established in Texas like I yeah, have you seen the bowls of chili that they serve there?

02:21.460 --> 02:28.060
It's it's it's fucking wild and they're just worried that at this point it'll be like a legal issue with the state of Texas

02:28.820 --> 02:31.580
But if I go back to eating these very small trendy

02:32.300 --> 02:34.520
metropolitan bowls of chili

02:35.380 --> 02:40.300
Then with all their various beans in it, like it's not gonna it's not gonna fill me up

02:40.300 --> 02:43.820
They made a suggestion. They said that you could say a honking big hunger

02:44.420 --> 02:47.300
Okay, I like that better actually. Yeah. Okay

02:47.300 --> 02:51.980
This is why these produce a lot of people these things down. I think it's good stuff

02:51.980 --> 02:57.580
It's good to get an outside perspective. All right, Justin. They said they they're loving your characters, obviously

02:58.100 --> 03:05.060
Big hit in the studio. They said the lore isn't complicated enough. Oh, you could yeah if you could develop a little bit more

03:06.940 --> 03:13.180
I have actually been deeming my own Taz arc people don't realize Oh within within my brother my brother

03:13.180 --> 03:16.860
Oh, it's a little ARG. It's a rich tapestry

03:17.420 --> 03:24.580
They said to me. Oh god, damn it still not interrupting enough and I don't know how much more. Yeah

03:26.740 --> 03:28.740
I hate interrupting

03:28.740 --> 03:34.300
Yeah, and you don't woman it this is what's fucked up to when we don't record. Yeah

03:34.820 --> 03:36.420
Travis is

03:36.420 --> 03:44.340
Very patient. Yeah, and always waits till someone finishes their thought and then he gives it like five seconds of sign

03:44.340 --> 03:49.300
Talking to Travis is interesting because then he'll be silent for like five seconds as he's like, let me think on that before I respond

03:50.060 --> 03:54.380
But but they don't like that for the show. They said a lot of dead air that they're worried about

03:55.500 --> 04:00.620
So you can just always cut that out though. Well, they said we need to spend less money on editing

04:00.620 --> 04:03.780
So we got to leave a lot more in that was another thing on here

04:03.780 --> 04:09.060
They still want Rachel to do the same amount of work, but not editing. They don't understand

04:09.460 --> 04:17.100
They said put more in to edit out. I don't I don't follow that one so much. Uh, let's see here. They said oh more

04:17.780 --> 04:22.780
About our advertisers operating in defiance of God. They really like that

04:24.220 --> 04:28.500
That was a hit that was a big hit they said both with advertisers and

04:28.500 --> 04:32.900
Our demographic of seven to twenty-eight. It really hit big

04:34.300 --> 04:36.300
Seven year olds hate

04:36.700 --> 04:40.860
God. Yeah, that's so you also read that that one doesn't seem to be a no

04:40.860 --> 04:43.500
It's just scrolled across the top of the email

04:44.500 --> 04:45.620
Okay

04:45.620 --> 04:47.780
They also said you're not enough stunts

04:48.700 --> 04:51.380
Okay, how would we do that in an audio form? Yeah

04:51.380 --> 04:55.940
I tried to explain that to him and they said that's the best part because we could basically do we could say

04:55.940 --> 05:01.260
We're doing a stunt. I mean we are recording. We do see each other on video now

05:01.260 --> 05:06.300
Yeah, fairly recently, you know, which you know, which I think is so interesting that you do know you do know that

05:06.660 --> 05:09.520
Yeah, cuz you're watching it right now. Oh me. Yeah

05:10.020 --> 05:12.660
Yeah, no, they're supposed to be watching the video. I

05:13.620 --> 05:16.700
Always do cuz I want I want to see the jokes come out

05:17.420 --> 05:19.740
So Griffin if you could just do a stunt now

05:21.500 --> 05:25.900
I got a foam roller back there. Should I just pop my back real quick? Yeah, I think that yeah

05:25.900 --> 05:27.900
I think for us that's a stunt

05:29.180 --> 05:31.180
Okay

05:31.260 --> 05:35.220
That's a thinner foam roller than I would and that's on his butt is that whoa

05:37.740 --> 05:43.700
Well, he's like well he's going off-screen now, but it's like a neo it's like a neo matrix thing

05:43.700 --> 05:46.580
He's dodging those see if you guys could see him

05:46.580 --> 05:52.740
It looks like he's being bullied by an imaginary eighth grader. Yeah, like making him lie on the ground

05:52.740 --> 05:59.540
It kind of looked like he was being bullied by an imaginary eighth grader who was shoving him over a smaller imaginary eighth grader

05:59.580 --> 06:03.740
Who had kneeled down behind him? So fucking good though. I am an inch taller

06:04.580 --> 06:09.660
More stunts. They also said we hadn't done enough to incorporate the Chrissy wake up

06:10.380 --> 06:15.980
Like remix song that they did from tick-tock. They said tick-tock integration in general hasn't

06:16.740 --> 06:18.900
We could reference the kid who likes corn

06:18.900 --> 06:25.980
I'm Chrissy wake up. I don't the boy who's very upset by this table and is it being and it being broken?

06:28.780 --> 06:32.200
Well, they said they just wrote here tick-tock equals timeless

06:33.780 --> 06:34.900
Apparently

06:34.900 --> 06:41.500
Counterintuitive, but okay, apparently the more we reference the more timeless it will make our show. Can I give the producers a note?

06:41.500 --> 06:43.500
Yeah, okay

06:44.100 --> 06:46.100
Running running a little long

06:46.100 --> 06:48.100
Producers

06:50.540 --> 06:54.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, then I don't think it's fair that this should just go one way

06:54.340 --> 06:58.540
I just want them to know that it's the one last thing just as far as tick-tock integration goes

06:58.540 --> 07:05.100
They missed the bit where we developed our own tick-tock sound where we each said one thing and then people

07:05.700 --> 07:12.580
Sound to use it. So they wanted not being a huge success. Well, but it was critically for the producers

07:12.580 --> 07:16.820
Like within the producer community and I don't just mean ours

07:16.820 --> 07:20.820
So apparently they got together with the other producers and talked about they loved it. That's fast

07:21.100 --> 07:24.620
So Griffin you go first and then Justin sure sure sure. Oh

07:25.380 --> 07:27.540
My style I guess you could say

07:36.100 --> 07:38.100
Now keep it going keep it going Justin I

07:38.100 --> 07:45.020
I can't top Griffin's. This is so vibrant. It's full of life. That is true

07:46.780 --> 07:54.020
Griffin you want to give us another run at it? Yeah, sure. Hey everybody. It's the summertime and you know what that means. Oh

07:57.060 --> 07:59.060
Yeah

07:59.060 --> 08:07.500
You guys remember spongebob squarepants, yeah, that was the don't interrupt the tick-tocks out. Oh, sorry

08:07.980 --> 08:15.820
You guys remember a little show called spongebob squarepants? Well, here's a visual joke about that. Don't I look like one of the characters right now?

08:18.560 --> 08:22.540
Okay, I want to try one I want to try one. All right. Hey, baby, what's going on?

08:22.540 --> 08:26.340
You want to come over to my house and check out this closet full of monkeys?

08:26.340 --> 08:32.340
And so I figured that could but it will be it'll seem like it's a first trap monkeys. Maybe it's stuffies

08:32.660 --> 08:39.980
How about that? How about like? Oh, yeah. Am I a real gamer? Just check out these stuffies. Yeah, that's good

08:39.980 --> 08:44.660
How about that? Like what are you? Uh, do I like Pokemon? Yeah, I guess you could say

08:44.660 --> 08:46.700
I like it a little bit and then there's like a

08:47.780 --> 08:51.500
Grand reveal of all there. Oh, yeah. Yeah right over it

08:51.500 --> 08:58.460
How about like Gundam more like fun dumb? Okay, that one's good. That was a good sound. Yeah

08:58.460 --> 09:02.500
Yeah, okay, Justin. You need to really hit it on one hit it hit us with a six

09:02.500 --> 09:07.980
I think me and Travis have both crushed it on at least one. Yeah, I just haven't okay. Oh

09:09.140 --> 09:11.380
Do something about ghosts people love that shit

09:12.740 --> 09:14.740
Okay here, okay

09:14.740 --> 09:20.500
One of the regular players on whose lines in any way. Yeah, I guess you could say I am and then

09:20.500 --> 09:26.460
And then that tik-tok sound could only be used by like Colin Mochrie. I don't know. Yeah, right

09:26.900 --> 09:28.900
All the gang

09:29.180 --> 09:36.780
Can you give us something like oh, that's a ghost something like that or it's just like something where it's just like the ghost revealed

09:36.780 --> 09:42.460
I'm gonna do a really genetic. Okay. This is like yeah generic is better. Yeah generic people can use that people can use that that's

09:42.460 --> 09:49.620
That's not how you do that wait no no stop that's not how any of this works

09:49.780 --> 09:52.940
Please stop far enough stop it

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
You're killing him

09:56.460 --> 10:02.980
Now I did notice Justin that was great I love that got less and less generic towards the end there that's the build

10:02.980 --> 10:08.700
Oh, okay. God. I love that. I love that. Okay. Well, we'll let that percolate for like a week

10:08.700 --> 10:13.260
I'll let that go viral now Justin the producers also said that they think you had a

10:13.980 --> 10:20.740
Tell you said that was the last producer bit. No now. I'm the producer. I was okay now. Okay good

10:21.540 --> 10:28.180
It's so tough when we're doing bits. You know it was that a bit. It's so tough. Well, it's just like high performance

10:28.220 --> 10:30.700
You know what I mean? It's like it's so tough when we're doing it

10:30.700 --> 10:35.260
Yeah, I had to have some pre-workout just to get through it. You know what I mean? It's got out in a minute

10:35.260 --> 10:40.320
Oh, it makes my skin tingle, which isn't normal. I don't think that's fantastic. That's great Trav

10:41.060 --> 10:43.740
so right, so I just wanted to like

10:45.420 --> 10:51.460
Say say this story that I wanted to tell you okay, I love when people preface the story like

10:53.300 --> 10:55.100
Okay, so

10:55.100 --> 10:59.820
This is a little long, but hang with so dad texted me a little bit ago

10:59.820 --> 11:06.660
A few few few few days and said hey he sent us all this picture of like weird out coming to the Paramount

11:06.860 --> 11:11.940
Art Center, which is a beautiful venue. It's in Ashland, Kentucky about 1,400 seats if I had to guess

11:12.580 --> 11:16.980
But which is smaller than weird. I would normally play so I was thrilled right he's yeah

11:16.980 --> 11:21.940
I've been to the Paramount Art Center before so I'm like okay definitely gonna go I look on line

11:21.940 --> 11:24.660

Far too funny hysterical

12:16.940 --> 12:21.700
so then I'm looking around this place is packed and it's packed with like a

12:22.100 --> 12:28.380
few people I could tell her like deep in the paint and then a few other people who are like remember weird Al and

Maybe or maybe they're like season ticket holders, and they're just like there right cuz Paramount Arts Center. It's part of a series

Weird Al comes out and

This icon is playing

13:27.520 --> 13:32.440
His heart out to a by design by the way none of this is unintended

13:32.440 --> 13:38.000
The by this man is playing his heart out to a room full of septuagenarians

13:38.760 --> 13:43.000
Who could not give less of a shit stone-faced?

Sorry, sorry, it's this a extremely protracted harpsichord solo

14:48.880 --> 14:56.680
No one gets up. Yeah, no one leaves. Yeah, even when he plays did he does one song?

14:56.680 --> 15:01.960
That's not an original deep cut. I shit you not it is all right now by free

No one left cuz it's a fucking great band and a great songwriter with a lovely tapestry

15:16.080 --> 15:19.360
My man closes my man closes this show

15:20.160 --> 15:22.160
with Albuquerque

15:23.040 --> 15:26.360
God that is designed to irritate me

15:26.360 --> 15:32.640
That is a this is a song where the joke in the song one of the jokes of the song is I forgot where I was

15:32.640 --> 15:38.600
And I'm going to start over in the song and it's designed to irritate people. That's the closer

15:40.040 --> 15:44.240
Amazing. Thank you out. I guess I just wanted to say thank you Al right like thank you Al

15:44.240 --> 15:46.240
Thank you. Thank you

15:46.240 --> 15:50.320
And you're welcome to everybody in there who got to go out to the boneyard with me

15:50.320 --> 15:57.160
My fucking middle school years of listening to the entire album. Yeah, finally paying off. Thank you for this blessing my leash

15:57.160 --> 15:58.280
I do appreciate it

15:58.280 --> 16:02.000
The thing I love most about this and there's so much to love about it

16:02.000 --> 16:06.360
Is that he also has the biopic coming out starting dinner a club

16:06.360 --> 16:11.220
He is about to and this is saying quite a bit. I think be the most like

16:11.220 --> 16:16.700
Mainstream well-known he's ever been and he was like, you know what I'm gonna do

16:18.620 --> 16:22.180
He said at one point he said I don't know if you heard but I have a biopic coming out

16:22.180 --> 16:28.100
Which is wild and I and we wrote a new song for it, which I would love to play for you here

16:28.100 --> 16:33.420
So everyone at that point is like, yes. Yes. Yes. Give it to us King. Thank you some new

16:34.100 --> 16:35.260
material

16:35.260 --> 16:36.380
fantastic

16:36.380 --> 16:42.100
They count it off two three four and then the song stops the lights come up and he says but we can't

16:42.980 --> 16:45.220
The lawyers would get really upset about it

16:50.060 --> 16:53.300
Yes, yeah, he ain't convinced it right out of right and then that's what he said

16:53.300 --> 16:57.860
I have the theme song to my last movie and I'll play that and he played UHF. Fantastic. I love

16:59.540 --> 17:03.340
Sir it was a it was such a great show. What a talent

17:03.340 --> 17:04.900
I

17:04.900 --> 17:11.600
I'm sure if he had known I was there. Yeah, he would have given a little and if he and known who I was

17:12.420 --> 17:16.380
And he would have brought you up you think and remember if he had remembered that he had been on our show

17:16.780 --> 17:21.940
If he had interacted with you in the show anyway, I'm sure he would have liked

17:22.740 --> 17:24.740
Justin get up here

17:26.620 --> 17:31.300
Let me be your hog man get up here you don't love me anymore get up here

17:31.300 --> 17:35.700
He did one more minute. Are you kidding me? Wow, one more minute. What a show

17:36.420 --> 17:41.380
Oh, I didn't even tell you the wildest part before Albuquerque his 13-minute closer

17:41.560 --> 17:44.660
My man does like an eight-minute doors

17:45.420 --> 17:49.220
tonal pastiche called Craigslist that has like a

17:49.780 --> 17:54.900
Three-minute long psychedelic freak out. We're just watching a bunch of 60 year old men on stage

17:55.740 --> 17:57.740
Cranking out a Doris fantasy

17:57.740 --> 18:01.660
Loving it for the ride. Yeah, baby. Yes, Charlie who is a

18:02.620 --> 18:07.900
Something of a weird out fan what her favorite song in the whole show was cuz she didn't know

18:08.500 --> 18:14.020
Any of them and she said my favorite song was the song where they did the flower colored lights

18:14.300 --> 18:18.580
That they were shining around the doors. Okay, that was for the kids

18:18.580 --> 18:22.360
That was the highlight for the kids is we had some colorful lighting

18:22.360 --> 18:29.520
Fantastic. We can see this show it is outrageous. You will you will have such a good time. Anyway, that's my plug

18:30.160 --> 18:34.120
for we hold on I have to tell you the name of the tour of

18:35.040 --> 18:38.680
this of this particular tour is the

18:40.840 --> 18:48.600
Unfortunate return of the ridiculously self-indulgent ill-advised vanity to her that's good. That's my dream. I that's my dream

18:48.600 --> 18:55.080
I hope to one day get up and just do unpopular bits. Oh, yes. We've got a couple of those remember the Detroit

18:57.320 --> 19:04.240
Yeah, but what if we could pay a bunch of thirsty noobs just drink up lap up our our our

19:05.840 --> 19:13.600
Bonus material. Okay. So this is an advice show. Obviously so advice go see weird Al on this tour. It's fantastic

19:13.600 --> 19:19.640
Fantastic. So if you can get tickets, yeah, good luck. Yeah, the next piece of advice is coming right now

19:19.640 --> 19:24.640
I love car washes specifically the automatic ones that have all the colored lights and bubbles

19:24.880 --> 19:28.120
I've always liked them now. I'm living in the city and I don't need a car

19:28.120 --> 19:32.400
So I haven't been through one. Is it weird to call an uber and ask them to go through the car wash?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.800
I would pay for it. So it seems like a win-win

19:35.880 --> 19:40.120
That's from car wash conundrum in New York City and I need us. I need a second

19:40.120 --> 19:47.800
Yeah, here's what's fascinating to me, right? Because this question is maybe one of the most clear examples of the question

19:47.800 --> 19:54.960
Is it weird having a couple different connotations, right? Is it right out of the ordinary? Yes

19:55.000 --> 19:59.640
Yes, obviously if it wasn't that would not be writing this you wouldn't you knew you knew that going in

19:59.640 --> 20:04.760
I don't think that the average uber slash Lyft writer writer

20:04.760 --> 20:11.280
Has done this. Is it weird to the point where the driver would say?

20:11.280 --> 20:17.560
No, I don't think so. I think if you could chain it together with something else, right?

20:18.240 --> 20:22.520
You can't just put car washes your destination because then right drop you off at the car wash

20:22.520 --> 20:27.400
It has to be like oh, let me add a stop real quick the car wash now

20:27.400 --> 20:31.840
You do need to say something ahead of time or else it's going to sound like a nasty dig

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
Oh

20:34.000 --> 20:41.040
Quick because your whip is so dusty. It looks like it looks like it just climbed out of a mummy tomb

20:41.720 --> 20:43.080
That's gonna be insulting

20:43.080 --> 20:44.800
But if you get in the car and you're like, hey

20:44.800 --> 20:47.760
I know that I put Trader Joe's in here as my destination

20:47.760 --> 20:52.000
but I do want you to know that you have won the contest the

20:52.440 --> 20:57.480
Prize is a free car wash on me and we'll go to one that's really far away

20:57.480 --> 21:02.600
So we'll run that fare. Yeah all the way to fuck up and this is just for you

21:02.600 --> 21:06.680
I don't think your car is very dirty. I decided I was gonna do this before I saw your car

21:07.520 --> 21:13.040
But I'll even get a rain. You have no judgment. Is there another way that you can fulfill this?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
dark urge other than

21:17.800 --> 21:22.760
Ridesharing I mean the only other way I could think of is to go to an automatic car wash and then wait

21:22.760 --> 21:28.960
So you see someone get in line for it? And then you're like, hey, is that cool if I hop in? I love this shit

21:28.960 --> 21:34.840
This is my favorite thing and I'm not gonna I have no knife. I know

21:35.960 --> 21:42.760
This rush album that I need you to crank up and let's lean the seatbacks open up that sunroof and let's enjoy that

21:42.760 --> 21:44.240
Well, don't open it up

21:44.240 --> 21:46.760
Obviously that would create a whole mess of problems

21:47.400 --> 21:48.680
Hey

21:48.680 --> 21:50.680
No, all right

21:50.680 --> 21:52.680
CLN

21:53.400 --> 21:54.920
RYD

21:54.920 --> 21:56.440
clean ride

21:56.440 --> 22:02.920
This is your app. Oh, this is your dream. Oh disruption future. This is your destiny. It's like uber

22:03.200 --> 22:05.600
but instead of coming to pick you up I

22:06.640 --> 22:11.560
Come to your house and I take your car through the car wash for you. I bring it back

22:11.800 --> 22:15.920
You didn't have to do anything. You call a ride. I'll be at your house

22:15.920 --> 22:23.840
I'll take your car. I'll wash your car for you. I'll bring it back. You pay me now Justin. Here's my worry

22:23.840 --> 22:28.720
This is there's no worry. It's actually this is a really good idea. Yeah good for our show

22:29.320 --> 22:31.080
clean ride

22:31.080 --> 22:35.840
I'm worried about publishing this and someone drinking our milkshake on it because this is a good

22:35.960 --> 22:41.880
App that could really disrupt it. This show is not about money Travis. What is as our as our as our

22:41.880 --> 22:47.240
Several minutes of promotional materials at the end of every episode will attest we don't care about money

22:47.600 --> 22:53.320
No care about ideas. Yeah and furthering the human experiment and that's what we're achieving with clean ride

22:53.320 --> 22:58.920
You're like the Socrates of podcasts. You could be at a position where you've given us all your personal information

22:59.640 --> 23:03.440
Yeah, hey this you've bought like we call them we call them ride bucks

23:03.440 --> 23:09.940
I don't want you to just pay in the app. You have to buy ride bucks and you can buy them at like any Duncan

23:09.940 --> 23:11.940
in

23:16.260 --> 23:22.180
Okay, we don't want Apple to take a cut right crypto no, you can't use crypto

23:22.180 --> 23:27.620
We don't want Apple to take a cut. So it's a different phone from your regular phone. Oh, wait, so you okay

23:27.620 --> 23:29.640
So you buy a phone loaded with ride bugs?

23:31.260 --> 23:36.620
You remember like cricket cricket wireless like I don't think they're still around but they probably do have a bunch of phones

23:36.620 --> 23:39.940
so we'll use those and those are now clean ride or

23:41.020 --> 23:42.740
soapy boys

23:42.740 --> 23:48.380
Clean ride feels a little antiseptic to me. I'm worried that it's not going to engender trust in people

23:49.180 --> 23:52.540
But soapy boy soapy boy, like let me call my soapy boy

23:53.500 --> 23:55.500
and whip washers

23:56.780 --> 23:58.780
Soapy boys better

23:59.460 --> 24:04.780
Boys, I feel like it's a gendered thing Griffin that's gonna get in the way where whip washers. That's the universe

24:04.780 --> 24:08.840
That's a that's too hip though. Only the Gen Z people will know what a whip is

24:10.580 --> 24:13.060
Let's maybe clean ride, let's see how that sticks

24:13.060 --> 24:17.860
So we'll go you go to a Duncan or a BP and you get a clean ride phone

24:18.340 --> 24:22.020
That yeah, and you can't know listen, you'll just use it doesn't make calls

24:22.100 --> 24:29.460
You can't use it to summon clean ride, but you can recharge it. Oh, it's really new more ride bucks

24:29.460 --> 24:39.180
three times, three times. Can I jailbreak it and get some emulators going or what's up. You can but be careful because it does not have

24:39.940 --> 24:47.540
At this iteration. Yeah, it does not have charging capabilities on the on the on the so when you say recharge it

24:47.540 --> 24:49.540
You mean reload it with money not

24:49.860 --> 24:54.020
Well, they have those special European outlets at Duncan's and that's what you need

24:54.020 --> 25:01.060
So wait, is there a tie-in with Duncan here? I'm confused. I'm just picking something that there's a lot of right we could do

25:01.580 --> 25:03.580
Duncan we could do

25:03.580 --> 25:04.580
Bank

25:04.580 --> 25:11.140
Orange Julius the bank anywhere that you might see a Tesla charger fire state fire house fire

25:11.460 --> 25:15.980
Houses anywhere people go a lot to shop or or commute. Yeah, whatever

25:17.180 --> 25:22.420
Part so that's your business. That's like a free business idea from from from me to you

25:22.420 --> 25:24.620
You can just do whatever you want with that. No problem

25:25.460 --> 25:29.580
That was close because that was almost a good business idea, but we ruined it. So yeah

25:31.100 --> 25:37.020
So I have a wizard that with a wizard sim sent me this well Lucia sent me this one

25:37.020 --> 25:42.780
It's a wizard wisdom and I would love to read it all to you. It is from the wiki house service

25:43.500 --> 25:45.500
it's from dating coach

25:46.300 --> 25:48.300
Imad Jabara and

25:48.300 --> 25:52.220
It is what does stink mean in a relationship?

25:53.500 --> 25:58.380
Did your partner call you stink and now you're scratching your head trying to make some sense of it

25:58.380 --> 26:02.660
It's reasonable if you're a little lost on this one stink isn't a super popular nickname

26:02.940 --> 26:06.500
So it's fair that you'd be looking for help here. That's where we come in

26:06.500 --> 26:10.300
well, you started like an ironic thing like calling a big guy tiny or

26:11.100 --> 26:15.380
Calling a clean person sticky. I mean we'll get to that

26:15.380 --> 26:19.220
Um, that's where we come in in this article. We're gonna break down what this means

26:19.220 --> 26:22.840
We'll also cover all the other ways someone might use stink in a convo

26:22.980 --> 26:28.060
So, you know each and every way this word can be used. Okay, but it is just stink

26:28.460 --> 26:31.280
That form of the word is just a noun, right?

26:32.500 --> 26:37.460
It's also a verb. It's both things you stink. Okay. Yeah, I guess so

26:37.460 --> 26:42.660
What does it mean if your partner calls you stink in a relationship? Your stink is like your boo

26:42.660 --> 26:46.740
This isn't a very common phrase, but if your partner calls you their stink

26:47.060 --> 26:50.100
It's sort of a sweet nickname like babe love or sweetheart

26:50.280 --> 26:54.020
There's a slight hint of teasing with stink that isn't there with other nicknames

26:54.020 --> 26:59.220
But it's almost always meant in good fun. For example, your partner might say, you know, you're my main stink, right?

26:59.220 --> 27:04.760
I could never love anyone. Oh my god. Yes. This is Melissa. She's my stink

27:05.360 --> 27:07.980
Hey stink, you want to cuddle and watch a movie tonight?

27:07.980 --> 27:13.860
I use stink the same way you'd use any playful pet name if you want to use stink as a nickname

27:13.860 --> 27:16.580
You'd use it the same we use any cute flirty name for your partner

27:16.580 --> 27:17.100
Just keep in mind

27:17.100 --> 27:22.220
This isn't a crazy popular slang term and your partner may not take it the right way if they've never heard it use this way

27:22.220 --> 27:27.860
Before you might say hey there stink. What's going on? You're my favorite lovebug my cute little stink

27:28.420 --> 27:30.420
Stink want to order a pizza tonight?

27:30.420 --> 27:37.780
Hey stink stink it's it's used that way out of context even in a

27:38.100 --> 27:41.620
Obscure context where I feel like it borders on the insult now

27:41.620 --> 27:47.700
I looked it up on Urban Dictionary because about 18 times this article has already said that it's not a common thing

27:47.700 --> 27:51.140
And I'm like, is it common in the way that it's zero and I looked it up

27:51.140 --> 27:58.220
But now here's where it could get confusing. Okay on Urban Dictionary says it's an affectionate name for a close friend or relative

27:58.220 --> 28:02.340
Wow, so you two are my strengths, right?

28:02.340 --> 28:07.540
So if I said this is my stink Melissa Melissa might be like I thought we were more closer

28:07.540 --> 28:10.980
I thought we were more than stink. I thought we were are we just sink to you Derek?

28:11.780 --> 28:19.400
Because Derek we've been intimate this next tip sucks. Ask your partner what they mean if you aren't sure well, no

28:19.400 --> 28:22.180
That's not that's a real purpose though

28:22.180 --> 28:26.620
I would say I would love to avoid if someone said you stink and I said like I love you, too

28:26.620 --> 28:30.540
And they're like no you stink like shit, right? That would be I would like to avoid that

28:30.540 --> 28:32.500
That's a good rule for all relationships

28:32.500 --> 28:36.580
If you don't understand what the person that you are in a relationship with is saying

28:36.620 --> 28:42.340
It's really important that you not ask them yet to clarify or expound on it because well, this is an article

28:42.340 --> 28:46.380
That's like roof. Well, I'm sorry Griffin. I'm I've been married for a really long time

28:46.380 --> 28:48.380
So I'm kind of giving out some gold

28:48.540 --> 28:55.060
You do ever ask your partner to clarify their feelings or like explain how they're feeling or ask any questions

28:55.060 --> 28:58.660
Then you're that's like a sign that you're not communicating. Well, so you're

28:59.780 --> 29:06.000
If you just understand it if you just understand it without asking or pretend you understand

29:06.000 --> 29:13.320
Right, you understand it to save the relationship. That's most of a good relationship is pretending right? We can all agree you pretend

29:14.620 --> 29:17.580
Constantly, I don't think this is good advice. You don't think so

29:17.580 --> 29:23.040
Like if your partner says you stink, you know, like I love hey guys. I don't love that. But I'm hey guys. Yeah

29:23.040 --> 29:26.280
It's stink normally refers to a bad odor. Oh

29:27.240 --> 29:31.680
Okay. All right. A lot of this is really stuck. Okay, it's opened up now. Yeah

29:31.680 --> 29:37.600
Yeah, now I get up a stink might also refer to a tantrum or outburst if someone's raising a stink or causing a stink

29:37.600 --> 29:39.600
It means they're making a lot of noise

29:40.120 --> 29:44.400
Giving someone I was gonna refuse that until you gave the examples where I was like, I've never heard someone say

29:44.400 --> 29:48.760
Well, they're really throwing a stink over there. Yeah now I do want to start saying that

29:48.760 --> 29:53.120
This it's trying to become more grounded this article here toward the back half

29:53.480 --> 29:59.280
Except for this next part giving someone a stink might refer to an attitude or a mean look ever hear of the stink

29:59.280 --> 30:04.160
I it's a term for the look someone does when they're annoyed and want you to stop whatever you're doing

30:04.360 --> 30:10.160
You first of all a very serious illness that we don't talk enough about frankly like we talk a lot about pink

30:10.160 --> 30:16.720
I but not enough about stink. I same cause but one smells pretty bad some folks abbreviate that to stink

30:16.720 --> 30:23.040
No one does that. No, are you mad at me for something? You were giving me the stink from across the room. Oh my

30:24.960 --> 30:31.080
That is a good way to defuse an argument though, cuz you're gonna say that they're gonna be like wait, hold on all that aside

30:31.480 --> 30:37.380
What what did you just say? No, no, I know. Yeah. Yeah, you know, did you just say I was giving you?

30:38.280 --> 30:44.560
Give me the stink and then last tip is says some shit about pheromones, but I think the most important thing is that

30:44.560 --> 30:47.760
We all need to be using this word a lot more because it's very powerful

30:47.760 --> 30:54.280
Stink is such a great word. Like I wish I'd been there the first time that someone smelled bad and somebody's like this

30:55.680 --> 31:02.880
Stinks and everyone would look at them like yes. Yes. That's the word. I know exactly what you mean by that

31:02.880 --> 31:07.760
I know what you mean by that. Do not define it. Do not explain it. I will know our relationship is in trouble

31:07.760 --> 31:14.880
But then some woman looks at her husband is like I don't that's what we use. That's the word we use

31:14.880 --> 31:23.760
We can use it for both, people will get it. People will understand. If you'd been there, you could have been you could have sprinted home and been like, honey, stink

31:24.760 --> 31:32.760
You'd be like what? No, I heard it today. It's a great word. Does it mean something smells bad? Yes. Yeah, right? Stink

31:32.760 --> 31:37.760
The same guy also said puke. That's like when the stuff comes out of your mouth. Yeah, exactly

31:38.760 --> 31:41.760
You got it. The wet mouth poop. Yes. Yes

31:42.760 --> 31:46.760
It's puke now. I love that. We're going with puke

31:47.760 --> 31:54.760
I love this Victorian garbage pail kid that you guys have. Yeah, I've been calling it vomit. No, no, no too clinical. We're going with puke

31:54.760 --> 32:05.760
No, no, no, no, no, not dick glue. Jizz. That's fun. And I can use these Z's and Scrabble finally

32:06.760 --> 32:14.760
I was gonna go with cum, but that sounds like it could get so confusing so often that I don't even know why we decided to even flirt with that idea

32:15.760 --> 32:19.760
Well, a sixth grader suggested it because they wanted to giggle in class. Yeah, all the time

32:19.760 --> 32:24.760
But I think jizz. No one's gonna use jizz. Hey, it's me George Lucas. Damn it. Damn it

32:26.760 --> 32:32.760
Okay, how about another question brothers? Is it time for questions? No, God, we've been recording for so long

32:32.760 --> 32:39.760
We gotta stop the fun to do other different fun and take a trip to the money zone

32:39.760 --> 32:52.760
Hooray!

32:52.760 --> 33:01.760
Honey? Yeah? Stink? Yes. Okay, thank you. I want to tell you about honey. Listen, I'm not gonna joke. There's no jokes here

33:01.760 --> 33:02.760

You guys know about this? You hear about this? Hey, you hear about this in the news? You put honey on your computer

33:18.760 --> 33:24.760
Now I know what you're thinking. Pour honey on my computer? No, you silly billy goat. I said no jokes

33:24.760 --> 33:30.760
Honey is something you download onto your computer or phone. Don't pour honey on your phone

33:30.760 --> 33:32.760
Take it from me. It's a mistake

33:32.760 --> 33:40.760
It's a free shopping tool that scours the internet for promo codes and applies the best one it finds to your online cart

33:40.760 --> 33:43.760

Why are you asking? Yes, why are you asking? Of course it's good

33:47.760 --> 33:50.760
Well, I was just trying to get you guys engaged. I'm doing all the work over here

33:50.760 --> 33:52.760
Just do the ad Travis

Honey doesn't just work on desktop. It works on your iPhone too. Just activate it on Safari on your phone and save on the go

34:10.760 --> 34:17.760
I know you're wondering when I click the honey button doesn't it make my finger sticky and my answer is stop being such a fucking prude

34:17.760 --> 34:21.760
Like live a little try some try some new stuff out

34:21.760 --> 34:28.760
Now Griffin you love honey you used honey to buy your weird paraphernalia for your body in your home, right?

34:28.760 --> 34:34.760
Yeah, I think I actually used it to buy my foam roller that I just used earlier

34:34.760 --> 34:38.760
I got a sick fucking deal on it. Hell yeah dude

34:38.760 --> 34:42.760
And I got a skateboard that I bought with it

34:42.760 --> 34:47.760
Yeah, I bought a skateboard and honey got me a bunch of money off it

34:47.760 --> 34:51.760
And then I got I didn't you know what I didn't buy though a helmet because I never crash

34:51.760 --> 34:54.760
Whoa, alright. Oh wow. Yeah

34:54.760 --> 35:02.760
If you don't already have honey. So I've been sketching on buses and I sketched a bus all the way to the White House and then

35:02.760 --> 35:07.760
And then you went on a date with the president's daughter. I went on a date with the president

35:11.760 --> 35:16.760
Thanks to honey I got a discount skateboard I sketched all the way to the White House and then I

35:16.760 --> 35:20.760
Can I say I fucked Joe Biden?

35:20.760 --> 35:22.760
There's a lot of people who seem to want to

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
Yeah

35:23.760 --> 35:27.760
A lot of people say that and they say and but I don't think they mean it in a good way

35:27.760 --> 35:30.760
God coming to theater, Griffin let's make a movie called My Date With Joe

35:30.760 --> 35:34.760
It's just like you and Joe on a completely platonic just like living in a

35:34.760 --> 35:41.760
Well assumed platonic I do think there needs to be a conversation at some point where the sparks start flying and it's like

35:41.760 --> 35:44.760
What are we? Are we stank?

35:44.760 --> 35:49.760
Is this stank? Hey is this stank? I've never experienced stank before is this stank? Is this stank?

35:49.760 --> 35:50.760
What am I stank?

35:50.760 --> 35:57.760

I had to mail a letter the other day

36:10.760 --> 36:11.760
Gross

36:11.760 --> 36:14.760
What is this Paul Revere Times?

36:14.760 --> 36:20.760
And I went and I was like where are the stamps? Where are the stamps? We just moved did we pack up stamps?

36:20.760 --> 36:30.760
And then it turns out that we did and so I got them out of where we had kept them and I put it on the letter and I sent it off

36:30.760 --> 36:36.760
But for a minute there I thought we didn't have stamps and I was confronted with this possibility I would have to go to the post office

36:36.760 --> 36:40.760
Relatable hashtag relatable

36:40.760 --> 36:43.760
You don't need to say that

36:55.760 --> 37:00.760

37:06.760 --> 37:13.760

Give me another question J-Man. Oh, unless you have one of your classic bits here

40:15.760 --> 40:21.760
Here comes a classic Justin bit. I had a classic I had a classic story next next week

40:21.760 --> 40:29.760
I think we will finally be I've been on pins and needles over here on PSL watch and I do it just as a public service as of

40:29.760 --> 40:36.760
August 25th the end of nominee 2022. There is no pumpkin spice date yet

40:36.760 --> 40:41.760
Yeah, it could be any minute though. I mean Mike I'm refreshing this page because that'll be a huge event

40:41.760 --> 40:49.760
But we're not there yet. So let's just do questions. I recently started a new job as a vet tech things are going well

40:49.760 --> 40:56.760
Or so I thought this morning. I brought in a beautiful homemade peach pie to share with my co-workers and no one had any

40:56.760 --> 41:01.760
I told people I made it to share and I took the first piece. Okay, that's one. Yes

41:01.760 --> 41:09.760
You did the exact right first thing to indicate that it's open for business have to yeah. Otherwise people assume it's a gift

41:09.760 --> 41:16.760
No one even picked at the perfectly flaky crust what never being faced with leftovers before

41:16.760 --> 41:22.760
I left my almost full pie dish and serving knife there in the break room. I have the next two days off

41:22.760 --> 41:27.760
Do I go back for my pie? Do I wait and hope someone mercifully tosses it while I'm gone?

41:27.760 --> 41:30.760
Should I put in my can't wait yet to go back to work?

41:32.760 --> 41:36.760
Can I put two weeks because I never felt such rejection and don't know how to recover

41:36.760 --> 41:43.760
That's from peach perplexed and Peoria. This is a fucking good question. This this is a good one. I like don't quit over there

41:43.760 --> 41:51.760
Don't wait in this economy. There's a that's there's never been a better time to quit so that that is actually bad. Oh, okay

41:53.760 --> 42:00.760
First of all, let's just say vet tech is it a very important job obviously, but it's not as like

42:01.760 --> 42:04.760
Like cyberpunk as it sounds which is unfortunate

42:04.760 --> 42:13.760
Like you're not making a lot of dogs when I hear vet tech like I want someone to put like a you know a hacker deck

42:13.760 --> 42:17.760
Inside of my cat's forearm or something. Yeah, obviously

42:17.760 --> 42:24.760
So that's a that is disappointing to me from this from the start Mike. I guess my next question is a peach pie

42:25.760 --> 42:26.760
is

42:26.760 --> 42:30.760
Is a gooey a lot it can be a lot of work

42:30.760 --> 42:38.760
So did you priest did you pre slice the slices because that's a big issue for me of like am I gonna slice is a really

42:38.760 --> 42:42.760
Small piece and people look at me and be like what's wrong with your small piece of pie?

42:42.760 --> 42:48.760
I bet you have a small wiener to something like that or if you make a slice of pie

42:48.760 --> 42:50.760
They're like I for a big wiener boy

42:50.760 --> 42:54.760
Yeah, save some for the fish and I'm like I

42:54.760 --> 43:04.760
I did you have plastic cutlery or real cutlery and like plates set out like you need to remove every barrier between

43:04.760 --> 43:09.760
Your co-workers and having pie in their mouths

43:09.760 --> 43:15.760
You're 100 the ideal for a pie if you're bringing in a sharer a pie is a rough one a pie is real rough

43:15.760 --> 43:18.760
I mean even a cake cookies are an obvious one

43:18.760 --> 43:23.760
Tiny pies

43:23.760 --> 43:29.760
But like it's really hard with a pie because there's a lot going on first off in its ideal

43:30.760 --> 43:32.760
Design a pie feeds eight

43:32.760 --> 43:37.760
Right. You could tell me it depends on how big no no no no as designed

43:37.760 --> 43:43.760
The perfect pie slice is one eighth of the pie, right pie is actually stands for a it's a it's like Greek

43:43.760 --> 43:48.760
It's the Greek number for pie. Nobody's gonna nobody wants to be the first like you took a slice out

43:48.760 --> 43:54.760
That's huge. Perfect, but it's really hard if you just see a pie there and it's like are there plates?

43:54.760 --> 43:57.760
I'm looking around are there plates are there forks is it sliced?

43:57.760 --> 44:03.760
I mean, I think in a future scenario you can help yourself by being like, hey, can I cut you a slice?

44:03.760 --> 44:06.760
Oh, that's nice. A little thirsty maybe a little yeah

44:06.760 --> 44:13.760
But especially if you're new there is also I will say this if you bring in baked good from home

44:13.760 --> 44:19.760
There's a chance that it is not good. No, I'm not saying yours is yours is yours is good

44:19.760 --> 44:23.760
But you're saying that that home baked goods right hand

44:23.760 --> 44:29.760
Be gross. And so I think you do need to be a little thirsty to get the ball rolling now

44:29.760 --> 44:32.760
I will also say this question asker you didn't ask this

44:32.760 --> 44:37.760
But as someone who likes to bake and would often bring baked goods in when I worked at the theater

44:37.760 --> 44:40.760
You do need to be careful because if it's good

44:40.760 --> 44:44.760
Now it's good and you do it like twice. I think you set a precedent of them being like

44:44.760 --> 44:47.760
Are you gonna bring in another pie? When are we gonna get some more of that pie?

44:47.760 --> 44:51.760
Huh? Do you do cake too? Oh, I'd love and it's gonna be a thing of like

44:51.760 --> 44:56.760
I miss when you used to bring in pot and it's just like that was one time five years ago

44:56.760 --> 45:01.760
And you could get like an added eventually people start to make you into a character

45:01.760 --> 45:03.760
I've had this of like, oh

45:03.760 --> 45:09.760
He's a fantastic bake Justin's a fantastic baker. Where do you try these and I'm like, no, they're garbage actually

45:09.760 --> 45:13.760
I hate you. Yeah, I hate these I get a shit job on me

45:13.760 --> 45:17.760
These are shit made in a crust and they made him wear a big white

45:17.760 --> 45:24.760
Chef hat at the office and speak with a French speak French accent and French words

45:24.760 --> 45:29.760
And he wasn't good at that part of it. And so Justin stopped baking

45:29.760 --> 45:34.760
Entirely because they wanted him to they said be the ghost from ratatouille and

45:35.760 --> 45:39.760
And Justin was like, I don't want to be the ghost from ratatouille

45:39.760 --> 45:42.760
No, I mean Gusteau. Next time, next time here's what you do

45:42.760 --> 45:48.760
You make some of my world-famous caramel snack mix and nobody if anybody wraps their lips right

45:48.760 --> 45:50.760
You guys have tried it, right?

45:50.760 --> 45:55.760
Yeah, but is that a bowl people are reaching their dog hair covered hands into Justin?

45:55.760 --> 46:02.760
Yeah, have a scoop and tiny bowls Travis even that I I was to say I've worked

46:02.760 --> 46:04.760
Is this gonna be funny?

46:04.760 --> 46:06.760
Well, it was a dog grooming place

46:06.760 --> 46:09.760
Are you gonna tell us about the expressing anal juices?

46:09.760 --> 46:12.760
Okay, dog hair and peach pie is actually a thing, right?

46:12.760 --> 46:13.760
This is what I say

46:13.760 --> 46:18.760
If I'm tending to a diuretic emu for example

46:18.760 --> 46:23.760
Who's just like big tall bird shitting everywhere and you're like, do you want some pie?

46:23.760 --> 46:27.760
It's like look at me. I got my hand up a rhinoceros his asshole trying to impress

46:27.760 --> 46:32.760
This is escalating it went from dog hair to emo to fisting a rhinoceros

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
Not emo

46:33.760 --> 46:36.760
Emo Phillips is fine and he does not need me to impregnate him

46:36.760 --> 46:38.760
He goes to a person doctor

46:38.760 --> 46:40.760
He doesn't need you to Justin

46:40.760 --> 46:46.760
I wish you, I would love to bear your children

46:46.760 --> 46:48.760
That's fantastic

46:48.760 --> 46:51.760
It's gonna be heartbroken when he finds out about the vasectomy

46:51.760 --> 46:52.760
He's gonna be so sad

46:52.760 --> 46:54.760
Man, if you all could see this

46:54.760 --> 46:55.760
Did you?

46:55.760 --> 46:58.760
You had a vasectomy

46:58.760 --> 47:05.760
If you all could see how pleased Justin looks with himself and realizing how good he is at this emo Phillips impression

47:05.760 --> 47:08.760
It's always thrilling when you find that you have one

47:08.760 --> 47:10.760
When you have a good one inside you

47:10.760 --> 47:11.760
He's there

47:11.760 --> 47:13.760
Yeah, yeah

47:13.760 --> 47:19.760
I'm also just realizing that taco in addition to my friend Michael Beck is heavily emo Phillips inspired

47:19.760 --> 47:20.760
100%

47:20.760 --> 47:22.760
Even a cobbler

47:22.760 --> 47:23.760
A cobbler

47:23.760 --> 47:27.760
You can't fuck up the serving size of a cobbler

47:27.760 --> 47:32.760
Oh I see you've got a patch in your loafers, allow me to cobble them

47:32.760 --> 47:35.760
Wow Justin, you're busting yourself up today

47:35.760 --> 47:40.760
I was just thinking about opening a cobbler shop

47:40.760 --> 47:48.760
Just like, bring your old beat down Nikes and I'll take them apart as they disintegrate in my hands

47:48.760 --> 47:52.760
What you do is you got shoes on one side and baked goods on the other

47:52.760 --> 47:56.760
You're selling cobblers, you're cobbling cobblers to make cobbler shoes

47:56.760 --> 47:57.760
I love it

47:57.760 --> 47:59.760
Now I will say this, here's the catch 22 by the way

47:59.760 --> 48:02.760
In case anyone gets the same impulse to bake a pie for a new workplace

48:02.760 --> 48:07.760
Buy a dozen donuts, it will be a way bigger hit and way less effort

48:07.760 --> 48:08.760
And that sucks

48:08.760 --> 48:09.760
It does suck

48:09.760 --> 48:12.760
Because you should get rewarded for like, I worked so hard on this pie

48:12.760 --> 48:13.760
Great

48:13.760 --> 48:16.760
But a dozen donuts will be a way bigger hit

48:16.760 --> 48:18.760
You can save more donuts

48:18.760 --> 48:21.760
If you are somebody who does a hobby that you share with people

48:21.760 --> 48:25.760
This happens with woodworking all the time, if I make someone a woodworking gift

48:25.760 --> 48:31.760
They will never display the amount of gratitude I need them to do

48:31.760 --> 48:41.760
To account for the literal dozens of man hours that it took me to make this thing

48:41.760 --> 48:43.760
And baking is the same way

48:43.760 --> 48:49.760
You got to make it because you love it, because no one's going to honor that time that you've spent on that in the way that you want to do

48:49.760 --> 48:50.760
No way

48:50.760 --> 48:52.760
You could have got it at Kroger, they don't know

48:52.760 --> 48:55.760
They don't know that you hand, unless they do

48:55.760 --> 48:59.760
And if they definitely do, then maybe it's time to go back to Piesquare

48:59.760 --> 49:00.760
Different workplace

49:00.760 --> 49:02.760
Yeah, I think your original instincts may have been right on this one

49:02.760 --> 49:05.760
Yeah, we came back around to it, but you're right

49:05.760 --> 49:08.760
Find an easier job for real

49:08.760 --> 49:11.760
Sell your pies on Etsy or something, people are doing that left and right

49:11.760 --> 49:12.760
Yeah

49:12.760 --> 49:15.760
Are they? Can I buy a pie on Etsy? Hold on guys, I got to go

49:15.760 --> 49:17.760
I think you can buy whatever you want on Etsy

49:17.760 --> 49:18.760
I really want to do this one briefly

49:18.760 --> 49:19.760
I got super high

49:19.760 --> 49:21.760
I bought a gun on Etsy

49:21.760 --> 49:23.760
I got super high

49:23.760 --> 49:26.760
Do you guys want to hear about my Etsy? It says live laugh love on it

49:26.760 --> 49:28.760
And it's got seashells glued to it

49:28.760 --> 49:33.760
I got super high and decided to reach out to people I hadn't talked to in a long time

49:33.760 --> 49:37.760
The question actually says I decided to reach out to you people I hadn't talked to in a long time

49:37.760 --> 49:40.760
Which is like, you did not reach out to us, I would have remembered this

49:40.760 --> 49:46.760
I was feeling good about myself, but when I woke up I realized I hadn't given an explanation

49:46.760 --> 49:49.760
Just a single word, hey, around midnight

49:49.760 --> 49:50.760
Nice

49:50.760 --> 49:53.760
Is there any way I can fix this?

49:53.760 --> 49:56.760
Most of these people I hadn't talked to in over five years

49:56.760 --> 49:58.760
Did they respond?

49:58.760 --> 50:01.760
They did not clarify if there had been any responses

50:01.760 --> 50:06.760
Now I can say, I mentioned Derek earlier

50:06.760 --> 50:08.760
He was somebody I knew as a child

50:08.760 --> 50:10.760
He clogged real good

50:10.760 --> 50:11.760
He was an amazing clogger

50:11.760 --> 50:13.760
I brought him to church once

50:13.760 --> 50:17.760
They set up a stage and he clogged to Janet Jackson's If at my church

50:17.760 --> 50:18.760
Come on

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
Fucking hell

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
It was so fucking fresh

50:20.760 --> 50:22.760
Anyway, I haven't talked to Derek in ten years

50:22.760 --> 50:24.760
But I was at this Weird Al concert

50:24.760 --> 50:30.760
And then I got, later on that evening I got a little elevated

50:30.760 --> 50:31.760
As one does

50:31.760 --> 50:34.760
And I decided I gotta get elevated

50:34.760 --> 50:36.760
Elevated

50:36.760 --> 50:40.760
Well no, Travis, that makes it sound like the Weird Al music got Justin completely fucked up

50:40.760 --> 50:42.760
No, it got him part of the way there

50:42.760 --> 50:46.760
It did, but then I got home and I was like, I was a little bit, and I was like

50:46.760 --> 50:50.760
So I sent a Facebook message that's like, hey, just wanted to see how you're doing

50:50.760 --> 50:52.760
Went to a Killer Weird Al show tonight

50:52.760 --> 50:59.760
I mean, I didn't realize until after I sent it that a lot of typos was 1145 at night

50:59.760 --> 51:04.760
Also have never sent him a Facebook message or anything else before ever

51:04.760 --> 51:08.760
And was casually talking to him as though we had texted earlier that morning

51:08.760 --> 51:09.760
But then

51:09.760 --> 51:11.760
No response

51:11.760 --> 51:13.760
It sucks

51:13.760 --> 51:15.760
Still trying to find him actually

51:15.760 --> 51:19.760
Can't find old Derek, but I'm sure he's out there somewhere

51:19.760 --> 51:23.760
Well, this is not an invitation for our audience

51:23.760 --> 51:24.760
Please don't

51:24.760 --> 51:27.760
You could then text him again like, I said hey

51:27.760 --> 51:29.760
Double down on it

51:29.760 --> 51:30.760
Hey is the worst

51:30.760 --> 51:32.760
Hey at midnight

51:32.760 --> 51:35.760
God almighty, what a boner

51:35.760 --> 51:37.760
It's just as bad as it could be, eh?

51:37.760 --> 51:39.760
It's as bad as it could be

51:39.760 --> 51:43.760
Because there's no read on that that is flattering to you

51:43.760 --> 51:45.760
Like the best read on that is like

51:45.760 --> 51:47.760
No one is going to be like, I'll consider it

51:47.760 --> 51:48.760
I'll consider it

51:48.760 --> 51:50.760
Especially there's the context of the time

51:50.760 --> 51:51.760
It was like 5 p.m.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.760
It could be like, maybe they just had a question

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
Maybe they just had a question specific for me

51:55.760 --> 51:57.760
And they wanted to see if this is still my number

51:57.760 --> 51:59.760
Midnight, they're high

51:59.760 --> 52:02.760
The best case for you, or they think you got hacked

52:02.760 --> 52:06.760
And that's best case for you

52:06.760 --> 52:08.760
And maybe this is a good way for you to get your foot in the door

52:08.760 --> 52:12.760
Is 72 hours later, you text them again

52:12.760 --> 52:14.760
Just like, hey, I got hacked

52:14.760 --> 52:17.760
So don't click on that, hey

52:17.760 --> 52:21.760
You know the problem with that? It's a lie

52:21.760 --> 52:22.760
It's a lie

52:22.760 --> 52:23.760
Oh, okay

52:23.760 --> 52:26.760
Hey, text him this

52:26.760 --> 52:29.760
I got hacked by Hi Travis

52:29.760 --> 52:31.760
Weed hacked my body

52:31.760 --> 52:33.760
And made me contact you

52:33.760 --> 52:36.760
It's just like, hey, I'm sorry I sent you a random hey

52:36.760 --> 52:39.760
I was extremely high, but I did miss you

52:39.760 --> 52:40.760
That part was earnest

52:40.760 --> 52:41.760
I hope you're well

52:41.760 --> 52:42.760
Oh, shit

52:42.760 --> 52:45.760
Okay, Justin, take it a little bit

52:45.760 --> 52:47.760
Say, I got contact high

52:47.760 --> 52:48.760
And when they're like, what?

52:48.760 --> 52:51.760
Well, that's when I got high and I contacted people

52:51.760 --> 52:53.760
And now it's a good joke

52:53.760 --> 52:55.760
That's a good joke

52:55.760 --> 52:57.760
And now you're like, you're back in it, right?

52:57.760 --> 52:59.760
The room's warm

52:59.760 --> 53:01.760
The room's warm, I love it

55:38.760 --> 55:39.760
Yeah, you're gonna inspire everybody

55:39.760 --> 55:40.760

55:40.760 --> 55:41.760
Yeah, just something

55:41.760 --> 55:42.760
Off the top of your heads

55:42.760 --> 55:43.760
It's like inspirational

To millions of people

55:44.760 --> 55:45.760
Okay

55:45.760 --> 55:49.760
Okay, twist it up tonight

You think you can't

55:52.760 --> 55:56.760
But can you?

55:56.760 --> 55:58.760
My name is Justin McElroy

55:58.760 --> 56:00.760
I'm Travis McElroy

56:00.760 --> 56:02.760
I don't know what

56:02.760 --> 56:03.760
Twist it up tonight

56:03.760 --> 56:04.760
Sounds like this could be

56:04.760 --> 56:05.760
It actually sounded like

56:05.760 --> 56:07.760
The beginning of a bop it game

56:07.760 --> 56:09.760
This has been my brother

It's a battle with you
