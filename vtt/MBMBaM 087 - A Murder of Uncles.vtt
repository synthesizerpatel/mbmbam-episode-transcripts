WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:51.040
Live from the second library of Downton Abbey, it's my brother and brother and me, Downton Abbey

00:51.040 --> 01:01.680
Edition. I cannot believe we got permission from Lord Grantham and his fam to let us hang

01:01.680 --> 01:06.320
here and record. We've got cords strewn all the way to the third kitchen.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.240
Well, we had to run an extension cord from 2012.

01:10.240 --> 01:18.000
Right, and that is a lot of cords. And then we have an internet antenna through time

01:18.000 --> 01:28.080
in the livery. But Griffin, how did we get here? How did we walk us through sort of the process of,

01:28.080 --> 01:32.000
you did most of the political aspects of getting us in here.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.800
So you mean the political aspects and not the chrono magic?

01:38.800 --> 01:42.000
The chrono stuff, that's old hat for my brother and my brother and me. It's like,

01:42.000 --> 01:51.360
how do you get permission? Well, I actually married into the family. I married a gay footman.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.520
Griffin gay married a footman.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.960
Much to the chagrin of granny, she was not pleased about that.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.360
I mean, we're very happy.

02:04.960 --> 02:05.460
That's nice.

02:05.460 --> 02:12.660
And we every night, you know, polish the silver as it were, as it were, as we do.

02:12.660 --> 02:13.380
Honk, honk.

02:13.380 --> 02:18.100
Honk, honk, if you know what I mean. And what we do is we travel through time and give people

02:18.100 --> 02:25.140
advice. Later on, we're going to tell Lady Sybil how to break free from the shackles of feminine

02:25.140 --> 02:29.780
imprisonment that the early 20th century has placed her in. But for now-

02:29.780 --> 02:31.540
And then we're going to berate the servants.

02:31.540 --> 02:37.060
And later, later, we'll be berating the servants. For now, we're all yours, though. I'm your oldest

02:37.060 --> 02:38.340
brother, Justin McElroy.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.020
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.860
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

02:42.420 --> 02:46.020
Well, technically, you're the second Duke of Grantham, Griffin McElroy.

02:46.020 --> 02:50.900
I'm the second Duke of footmanship, your lordship, Griffin McElroy.

02:52.580 --> 02:55.220
I assume that footman exists just to like give foot rubs, right?

02:55.220 --> 02:56.340
I assume so.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.980
Yeah. How is he doing with that? On that end-

02:58.980 --> 02:59.700
Pretty good.

03:00.260 --> 03:00.740
Pretty good?

03:00.740 --> 03:01.300
Mm-hmm.

03:01.940 --> 03:06.020
Well, that's good to hear. So let's get right into the advice. Hey,

03:07.140 --> 03:12.420
I was wondering if you have any insight into how to find the line between being a nice guy

03:12.420 --> 03:18.500
and being quote, unquote, whipped in a relationship. I'm a straight guy, but I guess

03:18.500 --> 03:22.820
this could be applicable to the fairer sex or anyone in a relationship, really. That's from

03:22.820 --> 03:24.820
The Mused in Britain.

03:24.820 --> 03:29.380
You know, I'm going to say that this is just like when we blew the lid off of bros before hoes,

03:29.380 --> 03:35.620
and I would posit that anyone who says someone is whipped in a relationship,

03:35.620 --> 03:37.540
the person saying it is single.

03:37.540 --> 03:38.020
Yeah.

03:38.020 --> 03:46.820
Yeah. Whipped. I get the idea. And I have known people who... I mean, we've all known people,

03:46.820 --> 03:51.540
right? Who are in relationships that don't seem to be good for them, and they are,

03:51.540 --> 03:54.660
for some reason, blindly sort of adhering to.

03:54.660 --> 03:59.540
Well, either that or they are so just puss crazed.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.740
They're crazed for puss.

04:00.740 --> 04:06.020
And they'll do anything for it, like for a Klondike bar, only for genitals instead.

04:06.020 --> 04:08.020
It's like a Scooby snack, you know?

04:08.020 --> 04:08.900
It isn't. Oh, that's...

04:09.780 --> 04:10.100
What?

04:11.620 --> 04:14.180
I do think it's important to remember...

04:15.860 --> 04:19.620
If you're the sort of person who maybe doesn't get into a lot of relationships,

04:19.620 --> 04:27.780
if you're the sort of person who maybe has gone a while without the companionship of

04:27.780 --> 04:28.980
the opposite sex...

04:28.980 --> 04:30.020
Or the same sex.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.420
Or the same sex. Yes. Thank you, Griffin.

04:32.420 --> 04:33.460
Or a dog.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.420
Or a dog.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.540
Or a rollercoaster.

04:35.540 --> 04:40.100
Not to equate those, of course. Not to say that someone who loves a rollercoaster is

04:40.100 --> 04:49.460
the same as a gay person, but thank you for that. I think coaster crazy is a pretty far cry

04:49.460 --> 04:52.100
from some living alternative lifestyle, but anyway.

04:53.300 --> 04:57.300
Justin, just because you said that, we're gonna get a whole bunch of shit from all of

04:57.300 --> 05:00.500
the objectumsexuals that listen to our show.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.780
Yeah, especially the homo-objectumsexuals.

05:03.780 --> 05:06.820
They just love people, but it's a long story.

05:06.820 --> 05:08.180
But only on rollercoasters.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.340
Only on rollercoasters, they enjoy the people.

05:10.340 --> 05:14.900
No, I think that if you've been a long time out of a relationship, it can be tempting

05:14.900 --> 05:22.180
to sort of sacrifice whatever you are to try to make that other person like you.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.460
And that's a danger.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.300
That's a good rule of thumb if you say,

05:26.020 --> 05:29.140
so are you doing it because you want to do it for the person?

05:29.140 --> 05:33.940
Are you making the sacrifice or being, you know, very thoughtful and kind because you

05:33.940 --> 05:36.420
want to or because you're afraid of upsetting them?

05:36.420 --> 05:39.860
And I would say if you are doing anything in a relationship because you're afraid of

05:39.860 --> 05:44.020
upsetting your partner, then you need to kind of take a step back and look at the way things

05:44.020 --> 05:44.740
are going.

05:44.740 --> 05:50.340
You should get married because I would say about 80% of the decisions I make, I have

05:50.340 --> 05:54.500
a filter first that says, is this going to upset my wife because I should not do it.

05:55.300 --> 05:55.940
No, no, no.

05:55.940 --> 06:00.020
There's a difference between being thoughtful and not wanting to upset her and being afraid

06:00.020 --> 06:00.740
to upset her.

06:00.740 --> 06:05.620
I think it was either Gandhi or Hitler who said that half of love is fear.

06:08.820 --> 06:12.180
And now that I said it out loud, that was definitely, definitely Hitler.

06:12.180 --> 06:12.980
Definitely Hitler.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.420
I think that might've been Machiavelli.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.060
Okay.

06:15.060 --> 06:15.780
One of those guys.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.820
Do you mean Machiavelli or do you mean Tupac?

06:19.380 --> 06:20.580
It might've been Tupac.

06:21.300 --> 06:21.700
Yeah.

06:21.700 --> 06:22.820
The great philosopher.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.420
Great philosopher.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.700
Great mind of our time, Tupac.

06:26.900 --> 06:31.060
Can we also give a piece of advice to the people who are unhappy and lonely and not

06:31.060 --> 06:31.940
in a relationship?

06:31.940 --> 06:36.260
Don't be that fucking person who's like bad relationships.

06:36.820 --> 06:39.620
This guy, who are you even anymore?

06:39.620 --> 06:40.740
It's like, I don't know you.

06:40.740 --> 06:45.620
And even worse, don't, man, everyone knows that you're unhappy.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.020
Don't grumble about it and make everyone uncomfortable.

06:48.020 --> 06:48.500
Yeah.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.140
That's all you're doing.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.740
Another Valentine's Day alone.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.020
Like, yeah, just get out.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.580
If you're unhappy, don't grumble to your friends.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.220
Just get out.

06:55.940 --> 06:59.060
Valentine's Day is made by Hallmark and the Illuminati.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.300
That's not accurate, but no, I get the idea.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.580
Hey guys, I need some advice.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.020
I don't.

07:06.020 --> 07:06.980
It's a question to ask.

07:06.980 --> 07:10.180
A girl gave me her number last weekend, which was a first for me.

07:10.820 --> 07:14.100
Unfortunately, when I called her a couple of days later, I ended up believing the most

07:14.100 --> 07:15.380
awkward voicemail.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.380
What's my next move in that situation?

07:17.380 --> 07:22.580
If she never calls back, do I ever try to call her again or have I lost my one chance?

07:22.580 --> 07:24.180
Wondering was in Wisconsin.

07:24.180 --> 07:27.540
Hey, wondering your instincts have not served you wrong here.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.460
You have in fact lost your one chance.

07:29.460 --> 07:34.100
I find myself laughing, not at the predicament that you found yourself in, but trying to

07:34.100 --> 07:37.700
imagine what the most awkward voicemail someone could leave is.

07:37.700 --> 07:38.740
I don't.

07:38.740 --> 07:42.340
I can't find cases and this is Steve.

07:42.340 --> 07:44.500
Oh my God, I'm peeing my pants right now.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.900
Oh God, there's pee and poop in my pants.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.860
Put this pee here.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.500
Did I call you good poop and pee in my pants?

07:50.500 --> 07:50.980
Ah, Susan.

07:50.980 --> 07:51.780
Your dad is here.

07:51.780 --> 07:52.660
I'm making him watch.

07:52.660 --> 07:55.140
Ah, mm, ah, one of them back.

07:55.140 --> 07:55.620
Hi.

07:55.620 --> 07:56.580
Talk to your mom.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.100
Is your mom there?

07:58.100 --> 08:00.900
I am a poopy robot.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.900
I am, I am a poopy robot.

08:06.260 --> 08:10.820
Listen, if you call this lady back anymore, you are running a real risk of pulling a John

08:10.820 --> 08:12.020
Favreau from swingers.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.300
Yep.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.860
And that is, that is my living nightmare.

08:15.860 --> 08:16.740
So now what is that?

08:17.460 --> 08:21.060
The scene in swingers where John Favreau gets a number and then he calls a girl and then

08:21.060 --> 08:25.140
leaves something like a desperate voicemail and then ends up calling her 20 more times

08:25.140 --> 08:30.100
until she answers the phone and answers the phone and says, please don't call me anymore.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.940
That is what you're, that's what you're going towards.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.860
And that'll ruin you in the lady community.

08:35.860 --> 08:40.980
I feel like maybe if you had, if you had been like building up to making this call and you

08:40.980 --> 08:45.780
finally made the call and you left an awkward message, then maybe you're just an awkward

08:45.780 --> 08:49.380
dude and maybe you need to find the lady who celebrates that.

08:49.380 --> 08:49.540
Yeah.

08:49.540 --> 08:51.780
As I say, just wait and see what happens.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.660
And maybe there's a funny story you get to tell your kids someday.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.140
Yeah.

08:55.140 --> 09:00.500
Either she'll respond with, oh, that's cute or, oh, he's a nut job.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.460
He's a stalker.

09:01.460 --> 09:09.220
You could call back and leave a more awkward voicemail or like an, like a very intensely

09:10.020 --> 09:11.140
angry voicemail.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.820
Now, what is that idea?

09:14.820 --> 09:15.540
Isn't it?

09:15.540 --> 09:19.700
I just thought you might be looping around the bend to a good idea, but it never came.

09:19.700 --> 09:20.660
The turn never came.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.380
The, the river of that particular hand.

09:23.380 --> 09:28.900
Listen, it's, it's all about, it's like the first episode of the bachelor.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.820
It's all about making an impression.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.460
So you get that first impression rose, you know what I mean?

09:33.460 --> 09:37.460
So like, it's not so much about offending her or playing to her sensibilities.

09:37.460 --> 09:40.260
You just got to fucking get in her mind space.

09:40.260 --> 09:45.940
You got to purchase a timeshare in her brain zone and then live in it and then be unforgettable.

09:46.580 --> 09:50.900
What if you hired a proxy to call her and say, please disregard Mr.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.860
Johnson's call, he would very much like to date you.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.300
Please return at your earliest convenience.

09:57.300 --> 10:02.020
Maybe just call her back and say, hi, Deborah, it's me, Philip.

10:02.020 --> 10:05.540
I wanted to apologize because when I called you before, I was high on crank.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.020
A lot of crank running through this bloodstream.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.220
I was high on crank too.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.180
That is not a practice I tend to give up.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.620
I intend to give up, by the way.

10:13.620 --> 10:18.260
If we enter into a loving covenant, I will still be getting high on crank.

10:18.260 --> 10:21.860
I would say for future reference, I think that if you get

10:23.220 --> 10:28.020
someone's number and you want to call them, don't leave a voicemail, anybody.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.380
No, I think a voicemail is good.

10:30.580 --> 10:31.060
Really?

10:31.060 --> 10:31.300
Yeah.

10:31.860 --> 10:36.180
I don't like people who don't leave a voicemail.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.700
I think the idea of leaving a voicemail for someone that you barely know,

10:39.700 --> 10:41.060
but would like to get to know better.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.300
It just seems so weird.

10:43.300 --> 10:46.980
I would be so afraid of them not remembering who I was right away.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.380
I'd be like, who is this person that left me a voicemail?

10:49.380 --> 10:56.180
It's a double-edged sword because it's a very low-stress sitch.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.780
It puts the ball in their court.

10:57.780 --> 11:02.340
If they don't call you back, you know it's because they weren't that interested,

11:02.340 --> 11:03.380
and then that's fine.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.660
You can move on from that.

11:04.660 --> 11:08.020
On the other hand, if this is your first number,

11:08.900 --> 11:12.100
it sounds like this is this dude's first number that he ever got

11:12.100 --> 11:13.460
because he explicitly says it.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.300
You're going to do bad.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.220
You're going to do a bad job, and that's okay.

11:17.220 --> 11:20.580
You got to fail forward.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.540
You got to take some learnings from this and move on.

11:24.340 --> 11:28.980
In the future, anybody really, if you're going to leave a voicemail,

11:28.980 --> 11:32.020
please be tactical about it.

11:32.020 --> 11:34.580
Know exactly what you're going to say and get in, get out.

11:34.580 --> 11:38.260
Because there is nothing worse than being ready to call somebody back

11:38.260 --> 11:42.020
after you hear what the message was and they're still prattling.

11:42.020 --> 11:46.420
I feel like you just need to say, think of it like writing a letter,

11:46.420 --> 11:50.340
and you need to have your greeting, the body of the letter,

11:50.340 --> 11:52.260
and your sign off and get out.

11:52.260 --> 11:55.620
Don't spend too much time in there, though.

11:55.620 --> 11:58.180
Don't be like, hey, Debra, this is Steve.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.300
We met last night at Dill's party.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.780
I think we should hang out sometime.

12:03.780 --> 12:04.740
Call me back.

12:04.740 --> 12:09.540
Don't say, hey, this is Steve, and I met you at Dill's party,

12:09.540 --> 12:13.060
and I met you at Dill's party, and if you don't remember me,

12:13.060 --> 12:14.900
I wrote you this rap, and then rap.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.380
Don't do that rap that you wrote for her.

12:18.020 --> 12:18.660
Don't do the rap.

12:18.660 --> 12:19.300
Don't do the rap.

12:20.180 --> 12:23.140
Keep it under like 15 seconds and get out.

12:23.140 --> 12:23.940
Hey, it's me.

12:23.940 --> 12:27.620
I just want to say loved your boobies and would love to hook up.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.820
Just really chat them out.

12:29.380 --> 12:33.220
Hey, this is Steve, and I'm here to say I love your boobies in a major way.

12:34.740 --> 12:38.660
Now, that guy would get a call back from me, but I myself am not a female.

12:38.660 --> 12:43.460
I don't know if that would be an effective approach.

12:44.820 --> 12:45.940
I suspect it would be.

12:47.860 --> 12:56.500
Anybody who parodies a Fruity Pebbles commercial in a sexual phone.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.300
Ho, ho, ho, I'm ho, ho hungry.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.460
That's from the Fruity Pebbles Christmas commercial.

13:03.460 --> 13:03.780
Sure.

13:04.740 --> 13:08.100
Do we know any other Fruity Pebbles commercials we want to spoof,

13:08.100 --> 13:10.100
or do we want to maybe move on to Yahoo?

13:11.860 --> 13:13.220
We can come back around to the pub.

13:13.220 --> 13:13.380
All right.

13:13.380 --> 13:14.020
We'll circle back.

13:14.020 --> 13:14.820
We'll put a pin in it.

13:16.340 --> 13:20.100
Do you remember the one where Barney burned Fred's house down?

13:22.580 --> 13:24.100
Barney, all my possessions.

13:25.540 --> 13:26.660
Rise from the ashes.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.340
Dance in the flame with me.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.100
These are the bones, the bones of Bam Bam.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.860
Watch him crumble around you.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.700
Can I have some cereal?

13:40.260 --> 13:40.980
You guys want to Yahoo?

13:40.980 --> 13:42.500
Stare into the eyes.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.340
Wilma's decapitated head.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.220
I burned your house.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.340
Your house is made of rocks.

13:46.980 --> 13:49.460
I guess if you leave that voicemail, then you're probably done.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.740
Yeah, you didn't do it right.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.260
That would not be the right approach to take.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.660
This Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

13:56.660 --> 13:57.700
Thank you, Jacob.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.860
It's by Yahoo Answers user Becky, who asks,

14:00.980 --> 14:02.980
where can I find an adult chew toy?

14:02.980 --> 14:05.300
My boyfriend has a really bad chewing issue.

14:05.300 --> 14:08.260
He chews on everything, mostly his shirt, collar, and plastic.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.980
Chewing on plastic is starting to mess up his teeth,

14:10.980 --> 14:13.860
and I'm looking for something he could chew on that won't mess up his teeth.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.820
He hates gum, so that's out of the question.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.740
Not looking for anything sexual.

14:18.740 --> 14:21.380
If anyone knows where I can find something you can chew on,

14:21.380 --> 14:24.420
like a toddler teething ring, except for adults, it would be great.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.100
Thanks, smiley face.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.620
Your boyfriend's a goat.

14:27.620 --> 14:28.580
You're dating a goat?

14:29.380 --> 14:31.540
You accidentally dated a goat.

14:31.540 --> 14:33.380
You accidentally dated a goat.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.180
You silly, silly Billy.

14:36.180 --> 14:37.300
That's a Billy goat.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.580
That's a Billy goat, silly.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.620
Did it wrong with the dating.

14:43.220 --> 14:45.860
Why can't an adult chew a baby's teething ring?

14:45.860 --> 14:47.860
Would that just be too ridiculous?

14:47.860 --> 14:49.060
He would just be too silly.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.180
He needs a man-sized pacifier.

14:52.180 --> 14:56.820
I would rather live in a world where an adult is chewing on a baby's teething ring

14:56.820 --> 15:02.900
than there's adult co. out there making adult chew toys.

15:02.900 --> 15:03.780
It's a niche market.

15:03.780 --> 15:06.020
Hey, stupid, put this in your gob.

15:06.900 --> 15:07.860
Thank you for the money.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.700
I like that this guy is of discerning taste,

15:11.700 --> 15:14.340
where he'll chew on his shirt collar and he'll chew on plastic,

15:14.340 --> 15:16.180
but you do not offer him gum.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.060
He hates gum.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.420
He hates gum.

15:18.420 --> 15:20.500
I think it's not so much that he hates gum.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.700
It's that he's got pica.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.420
Have you ever caught him eating paint chips outside?

15:26.420 --> 15:27.140
Eats his hair.

15:27.940 --> 15:28.740
Is that a problem?

15:30.500 --> 15:34.820
I like that this person specifically says he's not looking for anything sexual.

15:34.820 --> 15:40.820
And if you guys can tell me a casual chew object that a person can have

15:40.820 --> 15:44.980
and then be like, look at that guy chewing on that thing, how sexual that is.

15:45.940 --> 15:49.460
I don't even know what a sexual connotation chewing thing is.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.660
Did she really think one of the question responders are gonna say,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.180
hey, maybe a big dildo.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.260
Chew on this boner.

15:58.820 --> 16:00.580
Why would anybody do that?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.980
There's nothing more sexual than seeing a grown man

16:02.980 --> 16:06.340
chewing a toy specifically designed for men to chew on it though.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.220
If you think about it.

16:09.780 --> 16:10.820
Maybe smoke a pipe.

16:12.100 --> 16:12.900
I get it.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.260
I get the oral thing.

16:14.260 --> 16:19.060
Yeah, but maybe don't be like a toddler about it.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.580
Maybe eat suckers like Kojak.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.260
Yeah, that's cool.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.260
That's a timely cool look.

16:25.060 --> 16:26.180
You could do a toothpick.

16:27.220 --> 16:27.940
Corncob pipe.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.500
I used to do thumbtacks.

16:31.380 --> 16:32.020
That's cool.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.940
That's extremely dangerous.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.300
Razor blades.

16:35.300 --> 16:35.860
Yeah.

16:35.860 --> 16:36.660
Well, gun.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.300
Chew on a gun.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.340
Chew on this barrel.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.460
Actually, that would probably be the best for her relationship.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.860
This weird shirt chewer.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.980
Maybe you could play a game with him called, what won't he chew?

16:50.980 --> 16:51.300
Yeah.

16:52.420 --> 16:53.860
Well, we know gums out.

16:53.860 --> 16:54.420
Yeah.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.380
Chew on this lighter.

16:56.100 --> 16:56.980
He's doing it.

16:58.420 --> 17:01.780
Chew on this cyanide pill and let me get into a real relationship with a person.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.620
Why does he have to die?

17:04.180 --> 17:05.860
Why can't she just leave him?

17:05.860 --> 17:06.740
He's a goat man.

17:06.740 --> 17:07.940
He belongs in a circus.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.700
He belongs in a museum.

17:10.980 --> 17:11.300
He does.

17:12.020 --> 17:12.980
Thank you, Indiana Jones.

17:12.980 --> 17:13.620
Indiana Jones.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.580
He stops by to tell us who belongs in a museum once a week.

17:18.580 --> 17:19.700
And it's Billy Goat Man.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.620
It's a new feature we're trying out.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.700
It's called, Indiana Jones and Billy Goat Man.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.940
This is my boyfriend, Billy Gruff.

17:27.540 --> 17:28.900
That's a 1% joke there.

17:29.780 --> 17:30.500
Maybe zero.

17:36.740 --> 17:37.460
Oh, God.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.100
In my life, this is a dark secret.

17:44.100 --> 17:53.540
I've only beaten up one person in my life and it was in middle school.

17:53.540 --> 17:57.860
And I was oppressed, I think it's safe to say, in middle school.

17:57.860 --> 18:01.700
And so I sort of found the only person lower on the food chain than me.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.260
And it was a guy who chewed on his shirt constantly.

18:04.820 --> 18:05.220
Nice.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.220
And I picked on him once.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.300
So don't chew on your shirt, I think is the moral of the story.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.020
Or Griffin will beat you up.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.700
Or I'll beat the shit out of you.

18:13.700 --> 18:14.500
Well, I didn't like that.

18:14.500 --> 18:19.220
I've only ever beaten up one person, but I did it three times a day every day for six years.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.820
Last week, he killed my family.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.500
Poor guy.

18:24.500 --> 18:24.980
Poor guy.

18:26.260 --> 18:27.540
I forced him into it.

18:28.820 --> 18:32.740
Hey, I was recently cast in a movie, which is exciting.

18:32.740 --> 18:36.820
The catch is that I have to gain about 20 pounds to look right for my role.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.740
And we're shooting at the end of January.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.900
What's the quickest way to put on the pounds?

18:40.900 --> 18:43.780
Irritatingly thin hipster in Portland.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.780
Eat a bunch of fucking food.

18:45.780 --> 18:48.020
Yeah, put some food down your face.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.140
Get food and then eat it.

18:49.140 --> 18:49.940
It's the best.

18:50.500 --> 18:56.260
Now, if you have to put on 20 pounds, do you mean 20 pounds of fat?

18:56.260 --> 19:01.540
Or do you mean 20 pounds of pure American muscles?

19:01.540 --> 19:02.580
Protein, diesel.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.340
Pure diesel.

19:04.340 --> 19:05.780
Get pure diesel.

19:05.780 --> 19:09.700
If you want to get ripped, and if you want to put on muscle mass fast,

19:09.700 --> 19:12.820
the best thing for you to do is start lifting.

19:12.820 --> 19:19.460
Because I think that that works a lot of your muscle sections.

19:19.460 --> 19:24.900
It works your delums, your Michelle Newlone cellos.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.420
It works those pretty well.

19:26.420 --> 19:27.220
Your pervases.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.340
It works your pervases out real tight, real nice.

19:30.340 --> 19:37.060
If you lift it while you're lifting it, if you can torque it, you can boost your torkelsens.

19:37.060 --> 19:40.260
And maybe you should back it up and reverse it.

19:40.260 --> 19:40.760
Yeah.

19:40.760 --> 19:40.760
Yeah.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.460
I'm just throwing it.

19:41.460 --> 19:46.740
Torque it, and if you can, while lifting, twerk it just a little bit.

19:46.740 --> 19:47.940
Twerk it and twink it.

19:47.940 --> 19:49.540
Just make it twerk.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.300
I think pure squats.

19:51.300 --> 19:56.100
If you could just do pure squats with a big barbell, you're going to get really strong.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.820
And I don't think anybody ever expects a hipster to be strong.

19:58.820 --> 20:01.700
No, you should add 20 pounds, but all in your legs.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.660
Ooh, that's good.

20:02.660 --> 20:06.260
Just remain waist up, hipster thin, giant.

20:06.260 --> 20:09.380
So it's like a big, stupid, upside down Popeye.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.580
Twerk it while doing dumbbell squats.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.780
Be careful because that is how people accidentally poop their guts out.

20:18.180 --> 20:18.820
That's a real...

20:19.380 --> 20:20.180
You guys know about that?

20:21.220 --> 20:25.700
Everything that holds it in down there, if you squat it too hard, it just goes and then...

20:25.700 --> 20:26.900
It just gives up?

20:26.900 --> 20:30.020
It just goes and then all your insides are outside.

20:30.020 --> 20:30.340
Whoops.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.300
But you're going to look fantastic.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.260
You're going to look great.

20:32.260 --> 20:36.900
You're going to lose 40 pounds and also the ability to be alive anymore.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.340
Some crucial pounds though.

20:38.340 --> 20:39.780
Some really good pounds that you really need.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.820
Have you seen Seven Pounds Starring Will Smith?

20:42.820 --> 20:43.940
Kind of like that.

20:43.940 --> 20:44.500
Sort of that.

20:45.380 --> 20:50.180
I think that if you're trying to gain the weight, you should find yourself one of your

20:50.180 --> 20:54.260
overweight friends and make a deal with him where it's like, hey, every time you're going

20:54.260 --> 20:56.820
to eat, let me know and I'm going to eat with you.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.540
Make enough for two.

20:59.540 --> 21:04.100
You're talking about, or you take the food away from your fat friend and then you do

21:04.100 --> 21:06.740
like a one pound in, one pound out sort of...

21:06.740 --> 21:06.980
Yeah.

21:06.980 --> 21:11.780
You're like, I'll eat that big plate of fried chicken and pasta you made and you can drink

21:11.780 --> 21:13.540
this PBR I was going to drink.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.020
Yeah.

21:14.020 --> 21:14.180
Yeah.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.620
Just make sure whatever you do, nothing too drastic.

21:17.620 --> 21:24.260
Still take your vitamins, get your omega-3s, get your immunity-boosting super fruit gummies

21:24.260 --> 21:25.300
from Genesis Today.

21:25.300 --> 21:28.580
You can like carbo-load, right?

21:28.580 --> 21:29.460
Yeah, that would be the thing.

21:30.500 --> 21:35.300
When Ray Liotta started Raging Bull and he had to play Tony Montana at the end and be

21:35.300 --> 21:38.260
a really fat boxer, that's what he did.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.420
He ate plate after plate of pasta.

21:40.420 --> 21:45.140
Because what you don't want to do is just eat like fistfuls of like Twinkies or something

21:45.140 --> 21:47.940
because yeah, you'll gain the weight and also diabetes.

21:47.940 --> 21:48.100
Yeah.

21:48.100 --> 21:52.340
You don't want to overdo it with the sugar, but take your vitamins.

21:52.340 --> 21:53.060
That's important.

21:55.540 --> 21:56.180
You guys hear about...

21:56.180 --> 21:57.460
Stop walking around everywhere.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.580
Do you guys hear about Paula Deen?

22:02.020 --> 22:02.420
What about her?

22:02.420 --> 22:03.300
She got diabetes.

22:04.980 --> 22:05.620
No.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.100
Yeah.

22:06.100 --> 22:08.980
Well, she probably didn't get diabetes.

22:08.980 --> 22:10.980
It was always nestled inside her core.

22:11.860 --> 22:14.100
Just waiting to strike, I guess.

22:14.100 --> 22:14.340
Yeah.

22:14.980 --> 22:17.380
The magic wasn't in the hamburger donuts.

22:17.380 --> 22:18.900
The magic was in you all along.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.580
I mean, let's not make fun of the lady.

22:21.460 --> 22:21.940
Why not?

22:24.180 --> 22:26.340
She has a debilitating illness now, Travis.

22:26.340 --> 22:27.460
Yeah.

22:28.420 --> 22:29.460
What do you, what do you...

22:30.260 --> 22:31.860
Well, I mean, like she probably...

22:31.860 --> 22:37.700
What I'm arguing is that she might have had an undiagnosed case of diabetes for the last

22:37.700 --> 22:38.980
10 years or so.

22:38.980 --> 22:39.460
Okay.

22:39.460 --> 22:39.940
It's hard.

22:39.940 --> 22:40.420
I don't know.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.620
I don't know an exact number.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.540
She had secret beatus.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.300
Right.

22:45.300 --> 22:49.940
Wilfred Brimley has extremely, extremely evident diabetes.

22:50.740 --> 22:51.460
Public beatus.

22:51.460 --> 22:52.740
He wears his beatus on his sleeve.

22:53.780 --> 22:54.420
He's got beatus.

22:54.420 --> 23:00.980
Anthony Bourdain, who once famously called Paula Deen the most dangerous person in America,

23:03.220 --> 23:06.420
said in a quote, he said something like,

23:07.060 --> 23:10.420
well, you can't really say this is much of a surprise.

23:10.420 --> 23:10.660
Yeah.

23:12.580 --> 23:15.940
Maybe this forces her to get fat and boring like Graham Care.

23:15.940 --> 23:17.540
Anybody, you guys remember Graham Care?

23:17.540 --> 23:18.900
I have no idea what you're talking about.

23:18.900 --> 23:22.980
The galloping gourmet who tried to get healthy and no one gave a shit anymore.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.580
Like, get out.

23:24.580 --> 23:29.380
We don't want our chefs to be eating healthy stuff.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.180
We want to keep our chefs fat.

23:30.180 --> 23:34.500
We want the two fat ladies that are like eating bowls full of butter.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.540
I love those ladies.

23:35.540 --> 23:35.780
Yeah.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.700
You know what happened to one of those ladies, Trev?

23:37.700 --> 23:38.420
What?

23:38.420 --> 23:38.740
Dead.

23:39.540 --> 23:40.500
Dead as disco.

23:41.300 --> 23:41.780
Yeah.

23:41.780 --> 23:45.220
Now it's one fat lady and that's not a cooking show.

23:46.020 --> 23:47.540
It's an episode of Hoarders.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.780
What if they flip it?

23:51.780 --> 23:54.420
What if we get a Freaky Friday one in one out?

23:54.420 --> 23:57.220
And we do Paula Deen gets real healthy.

23:57.220 --> 23:58.420
I would watch a show about that.

23:58.980 --> 24:05.780
And then Jamie Oliver just like loses his mind and just eats nothing but trans fats.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.140
And if they were like doing it at this,

24:09.140 --> 24:11.060
there would be like a moment on the show,

24:11.060 --> 24:13.780
an episode where they were meeting each other.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.860
Two ships passing.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.700
And they would fall in love forever.

24:19.700 --> 24:26.340
Paula, I've always really thought you were real fat, right?

24:26.340 --> 24:28.980
But now like I'm sort of fat and you're like less fat.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.460
We're both at 220 lbs.

24:34.100 --> 24:39.300
We weigh 16 stones or however many stones it is.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.180
I forget.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.980
Sometimes I forget how many pounds stones are.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.460
I know that's weird for somebody from England, right?

24:45.460 --> 24:52.260
But like when you guys say pounds, we think money, but it's real confusing, right?

24:52.260 --> 24:57.620
So like you say, I think you weigh 220 money.

24:58.340 --> 24:58.580
Yeah.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.700
And you look money to me though, girl.

25:01.700 --> 25:02.740
I love your silver hair.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.700
I want to call you a silver fox.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.860
I really love, please ignore my stretch marks.

25:07.860 --> 25:09.300
I've gained quite a bit of weight.

25:09.300 --> 25:14.100
What if Jamie Oliver went to a poor city and then make that city fat?

25:15.380 --> 25:19.300
Or you went to like a really skinny, like well-to-do city and said,

25:19.300 --> 25:20.340
I'm going to mess this place up.

25:20.340 --> 25:21.140
Let's plump it.

25:21.940 --> 25:25.220
San Francisco, you're making everyone else miserable.

25:26.420 --> 25:27.860
Let's get the average up.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.500
Everybody plump it up.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.340
Plump it up, right?

25:32.340 --> 25:33.140
Just like me.

25:33.140 --> 25:33.700
Yeah, yeah.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.460
Fat Jamie Oliver.

25:36.420 --> 25:37.620
Mr. Paula Deen.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.620
Mr. Paula Deen.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.580
That's right.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.740
I took her away from that fat Santa Claus guy.

25:44.020 --> 25:44.580
We're in love.

25:45.700 --> 25:48.660
The lady and sons and me, Jamie Oliver.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.700
We're all in love.

25:49.700 --> 25:50.580
We're all in love.

25:50.580 --> 25:51.700
No, that's not right.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.540
Griffin, do you have any Yahoo's lying around?

25:55.540 --> 25:56.340
Yeah, I got a bunch.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.940
Let's keep the food train rolling.

25:59.940 --> 26:01.620
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

26:01.620 --> 26:02.500
Thanks, Galiayali.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.740
It's by Yahoo Answers user Hi.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.660
Hi?

26:06.660 --> 26:08.740
That's H-I-G-H and then a question mark.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.620
Who asks, yes?

26:11.620 --> 26:13.540
You're on Yahoo Answers, I'm going to assume.

26:14.260 --> 26:17.380
What do you do to make the lettuce on your sandwich feel sexy?

26:20.420 --> 26:20.920
Wait.

26:22.100 --> 26:22.420
Uh-huh.

26:23.540 --> 26:29.300
The responses to this question really shows off that Yahoo Answers is just an Algonquin

26:29.300 --> 26:30.500
round table of comedy.

26:31.380 --> 26:32.100
Hold on.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.780
Is there no more to the question?

26:33.780 --> 26:34.180
That's it?

26:34.180 --> 26:34.740
No, that's it.

26:34.740 --> 26:35.240
That's it.

26:36.820 --> 26:41.620
Megan responded, lay my meat on it real slow, then squirt mayo on it.

26:43.220 --> 26:43.720
God.

26:45.380 --> 26:49.940
I get it all wet, put it under water just to make it so much more important that the

26:49.940 --> 26:54.020
rest of the lettuce, when really I'm just trying to wash any bacteria off, then I get

26:54.020 --> 26:55.540
kinky with it and bite it.

26:57.380 --> 26:59.540
That took a weird practical turn in the middle.

26:59.540 --> 27:04.340
Yo, girl, you know DDT and what all, and then I funk it.

27:04.340 --> 27:09.780
Dress it up in something sexy, not mayo, I can't enjoy it if it's dry unless it stays

27:09.780 --> 27:14.740
completely naked, whisper naughty things to it, put it in your mouth to bite it and suck

27:14.740 --> 27:15.240
on it.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.260
It's lettuce.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.060
Everybody, it's lettuce.

27:19.060 --> 27:20.820
Like, what's the matter with you?

27:20.820 --> 27:23.300
Let me suck on this sandwich, fixins.

27:24.340 --> 27:28.100
I forgot, I've lost the place where it's griffin and egg.

27:28.100 --> 27:32.020
Place where it's griffin and the yahu answers things and now I just think my brother's

27:32.020 --> 27:34.100
this awful, awful mess of humanity.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.100
Add salad cream.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.460
No, wait, hold on.

27:39.460 --> 27:41.540
Does it say add salad cream?

27:41.540 --> 27:46.260
Add salad cream in all caps and a smiley face at the end of it.

27:46.260 --> 27:48.340
Hey, America, that's not even a thing.

27:48.340 --> 27:49.060
That's not a thing.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.780
You made up salad cream for your dumb joke.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.780
You mean salad dressing?

27:54.500 --> 27:56.180
A special secret sauce.

27:56.180 --> 27:59.540
Why are you, why are you jizzing on your sandwich?

27:59.540 --> 28:01.460
Why are you objectifying lettuce?

28:01.460 --> 28:02.420
Put that away.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.660
How about you just eat it?

28:04.660 --> 28:07.220
How about you just put it in your mouth cause lettuce?

28:07.220 --> 28:13.300
Hey, internet, stop what you're doing, put down the mouse, open the front door and walk

28:13.300 --> 28:17.460
outside and remember that you live in a real world with consequences for your actions.

28:17.460 --> 28:18.420
Call your dad.

28:18.420 --> 28:19.380
Call your dad.

28:20.020 --> 28:20.580
Just call your dad.

28:20.580 --> 28:22.100
Tell him what you're doing right now.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.700
You're talking about fucking lettuce.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.740
Can I give you guys just the fucking straight dope?

28:26.740 --> 28:27.060
Yeah.

28:27.060 --> 28:27.860
And here's the truth.

28:27.860 --> 28:31.380
And if you're sitting at home, you're gonna, you're gonna, at first you'll, you'll raise

28:31.380 --> 28:33.060
an eyebrow and then you'll admit it's true.

28:33.060 --> 28:38.980
The only reason anybody has ever put lettuce on a sandwich is so it looks more like a sandwich

28:38.980 --> 28:40.020
on TV.

28:40.020 --> 28:40.500
Yes.

28:40.500 --> 28:44.100
That's a hundred percent, like, oh man, this really looks like a sandwich now.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.380
Not just meat on bread.

28:45.380 --> 28:46.580
It looks like something on TV.

28:47.460 --> 28:51.380
If you want it, sometimes I do it to trick my brain into thinking that I'm eating vegetables.

28:51.380 --> 28:54.580
There's people in our listening audience right now who are like, but I like it when the sandwich

28:54.580 --> 28:55.300
is crunchy.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.140
Then put Fritos on that shit because Fritos taste-

28:57.140 --> 28:58.100
You put potato chips on that shit.

28:58.100 --> 28:58.900
Fritos taste great.

29:00.420 --> 29:01.300
Fritos are great.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.260
Lettuce is, is for appearances only.

29:04.260 --> 29:07.460
It should feel sexy because it's, we only want it for its looks.

29:08.500 --> 29:08.980
Right?

29:08.980 --> 29:10.580
I'm personifying lettuce now.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.820
And then I want to bite it and then I'm gonna bite it.

29:12.820 --> 29:14.260
Suck on that sandwich.

29:14.260 --> 29:14.980
Mmm.

29:14.980 --> 29:17.140
What are you doing?

29:17.140 --> 29:19.380
That's not how you consume it.

29:19.380 --> 29:25.140
How you consume it, someone said, someone responded, I'd put it in between two big baps.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.060
What?

29:27.060 --> 29:27.780
Sorry, what?

29:28.340 --> 29:29.940
I put it in between two big-

29:29.940 --> 29:30.980
African princesses?

29:31.540 --> 29:32.340
Is that what that is?

29:32.900 --> 29:34.580
I think that's what a bap is, right?

29:35.300 --> 29:36.740
Isn't that what Halle Berry taught us?

29:36.740 --> 29:37.300
To the Google.

29:38.580 --> 29:42.500
To the Google, Google away, to the baps.

29:43.780 --> 29:48.740
I'm pretty sure that was Halle Berry and another lady who has not maintained the same level

29:48.740 --> 29:52.580
of fame over time that Halle Berry did.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.100
It is actually a, a flowery soft bread roll.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.300
So not sexual at all.

29:58.020 --> 30:00.580
Oh, used affectionately to describe breasts.

30:00.580 --> 30:04.820
So why do you want to eat boobs with lettuce in it?

30:05.380 --> 30:08.980
I want to put some lettuce between the girl's boobs and then she'll get real mad at me.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.020
Yeah, this is going to be bad.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.100
That's a weird thing to do to someone.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.780
Oh, was that the voicemail he left?

30:13.780 --> 30:16.740
Hey, listen, I want to put some lettuce between your baps.

30:17.300 --> 30:18.500
Hey, this is Steve.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.620
We met at Jill's party.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.860
Had a great time talking to you and I want to put some lettuce in your boobs.

30:21.860 --> 30:25.140
I would like to put some crisp iceberg in between your posomes.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.820
Just let's come on over.

30:28.820 --> 30:29.940
So call me back.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.420
Let's split a posone and do this.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.340
Get this done.

30:36.340 --> 30:38.820
We'll eat a posone and then we'll take a piziz and-

30:38.820 --> 30:40.180
I need you to sex up my lettuce.

30:40.900 --> 30:47.380
You know, speaking of lettuce, the best way I know of getting Eckamore is by going to

30:47.380 --> 30:56.900
the Money Zone.

30:59.940 --> 31:06.580
This message is for Scott Hammond and it's coming from your buddy Josh.

31:06.580 --> 31:10.660
And we just want to say, hey, happy 24th birthday.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.860
I bet it's cold where you're at right now.

31:14.420 --> 31:15.940
Northern Ontario, Canada.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.300
Yeah, I'd say it's pretty chilly.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.020
Pretty chilly.

31:18.020 --> 31:21.700
I hope you're snuggling up with friends and loved ones.

31:22.580 --> 31:25.140
Not that those two groups are always mutually exclusive.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.940
I hope you're snuggling with strangers.

31:27.940 --> 31:28.420
Yeah.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.260
Making a love connection with some weirdos.

31:30.260 --> 31:31.620
Like on the bus, right?

31:31.620 --> 31:33.380
Yeah, or in a subway.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.100
Like a restaurant subway.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.100
Yeah, like a restaurant subway.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.860
You're snuggled up next to a sandwich artist.

31:39.860 --> 31:45.860
Um, so happy birthday to Scott, 24 years young.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.260
Uh, you got one more year and you start rolling towards 30.

31:48.260 --> 31:49.780
You don't look a day over 12.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.060
Yeah, gorgeous.

31:51.060 --> 31:56.580
Scott has asked that I sing him something, but, um, uh, he spelled my name wrong.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.900
So I'll just sing one note.

32:04.260 --> 32:05.780
I feel haunted now.

32:05.780 --> 32:06.580
That was haunting.

32:06.580 --> 32:09.460
You can get the rest of the song on your next birthday just by singing it.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.580
Just spell my name right.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.140
God damn it.

32:12.740 --> 32:20.580
Dan Rogers, uh, you got a message coming from Mike and Tony and Danielle and Colin and Kristoff

32:20.580 --> 32:22.660
and Alex and Mark and Chris.

32:23.540 --> 32:24.100
Jesus.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.700
That's with a K-R-I-S.

32:25.700 --> 32:26.580
You got a lot of friends, Dan.

32:26.580 --> 32:27.860
I wish I had more friends.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.460
Guys, do you know what today is?

32:29.460 --> 32:31.220
Well, you can't because Dan has all the friends.

32:31.220 --> 32:31.380
Yeah.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.980
Dan took all your friends and it's Dan's 24th birthday too.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.020
Oh man.

32:36.020 --> 32:36.340
What?

32:36.340 --> 32:38.820
Dan and Scott are separated at birth.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.580
Well, he's a witty, well-dressed dude.

32:40.580 --> 32:41.780
Now I have no proof of that.

32:41.780 --> 32:43.860
This is, this is secondhand.

32:44.420 --> 32:49.540
He likes great music and has an eclectic taste for fighting game characters.

32:49.540 --> 32:50.580
He knows his boos.

32:50.580 --> 32:54.020
Weird fighting game characters like Voldo from Soul Calibur.

32:54.020 --> 32:55.380
Like Pepsi Man.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.220
It's deep.

32:57.220 --> 32:58.020
It's a deep cut.

32:58.020 --> 32:58.580
Real deep.

32:58.580 --> 32:59.380
Like Spawn.

32:59.380 --> 32:59.880
Yeah.

33:00.900 --> 33:04.180
And he introduced all your friends to Mabim Bam, which is the most important thing you've

33:04.180 --> 33:04.740
ever heard of.

33:04.740 --> 33:08.420
Bam, which is the most important thing you've ever done or ever will do.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.580
So thank you, Dan, for that.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.740
And happy birthday, my friend.

33:13.700 --> 33:18.420
So go out there, enjoy some of the boos you know so well and enjoy doing the hustle.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.300
Because that's, that's your life.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.420
That's your day to day.

33:22.420 --> 33:24.260
And you, you've lived 24 years of it.

33:24.260 --> 33:25.700
No reason to change now.

33:25.700 --> 33:26.500
Lean into it.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.220
That's what I say.

33:27.780 --> 33:28.820
Too old to change.

33:28.820 --> 33:31.940
Keep talking about how Blanca is your favorite Street Fighter character.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.980
You've earned it.

33:34.980 --> 33:41.140
Hey, and speaking of people we love, because we do very much love Dan and Scott, we also

33:41.140 --> 33:44.100
love the other podcast on the Maximum Fun Network.

33:44.100 --> 33:46.500
So let's hear from one of those right now.

33:50.420 --> 33:51.060
Hello there.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.340
My name is Graham Clark.

33:52.340 --> 33:53.620
And I'm Dave Shumka.

33:53.620 --> 33:57.460
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

33:57.460 --> 34:01.460
This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to it in your

34:01.460 --> 34:01.780
pod.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.220
What's that about, you ask?

34:03.220 --> 34:04.660
Well, who are you to ask?

34:04.660 --> 34:05.780
Who do you think you are?

34:05.780 --> 34:07.780
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

34:07.780 --> 34:12.180
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

34:12.180 --> 34:14.820
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.180
Sometimes they're Canadian.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.380
Sometimes they're not.

34:17.380 --> 34:18.740
Sometimes they're a ghost.

34:18.740 --> 34:22.020
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.060
Plus we're Canadian.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.820
So you get a tax break.

34:24.820 --> 34:30.340
You can find us on iTunes or online at Maximumfun.org.

34:30.340 --> 34:30.820
Huh?

34:30.820 --> 34:31.940
Ooh, spell.

34:33.220 --> 34:35.380
Guys, a couple of months ago I asked a girl out.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.060
She said yes.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.260
So we went on a couple of dates.

34:38.260 --> 34:39.540
Everything went fine at first.

34:39.540 --> 34:45.300
But for the next few weeks she was constantly busy anytime I asked her out.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.700
She would agree to go somewhere, but sometimes something would always come up on the day

34:49.700 --> 34:50.180
of.

34:50.180 --> 34:51.060
I got the hint.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.660
Figured it wasn't going anywhere.

34:52.660 --> 34:58.820
After about a month, she wanted to go out again, but yet stood me up a few more times.

34:59.380 --> 35:02.020
I understand things come up, but this is ridiculous.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.780
Should I continue trying to pursue a relationship or just move on?

35:05.780 --> 35:08.260
That's from Confused in New York.

35:08.260 --> 35:10.340
What's the fucking debate?

35:11.220 --> 35:12.180
You move on.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.220
Yeah, you get out.

35:13.220 --> 35:13.940
Just leave.

35:13.940 --> 35:16.260
And maybe take some of her stuff with you when you go.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.900
I've wanted, listen, I have wanted to

35:20.900 --> 35:23.300
like pickles for as long as I can remember.

35:23.300 --> 35:26.580
And every few months I'll open up a pickle jar.

35:26.580 --> 35:32.180
I'll get a nice, you know, long kosher dill, something that looks real crisp and great.

35:32.180 --> 35:36.100
And I'll take a bite and I'll say, no, I still hate this.

35:36.100 --> 35:36.580
Still no.

35:36.580 --> 35:38.900
That's what she's doing with you right now.

35:38.900 --> 35:42.580
She keeps forgetting that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.660
So she'll call and she'll talk to you for a few minutes.

35:44.660 --> 35:45.780
Then she'll say, hey, wait a minute.

35:45.780 --> 35:47.140
I still don't like this.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.580
I want to stand him up again.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.460
That's what's happening.

35:49.460 --> 35:53.460
At best, at worst, she's just a fucking jerk and you don't have to waste it.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.980
She's saying, I'm bored.

35:54.980 --> 35:58.820
Maybe I'll make plans with him until something better comes along and then cancel them.

35:58.820 --> 36:02.660
You should do like pickles should have done to me long ago and dump me.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.740
Do you know how many two thirds uneaten pickles I've thrown in the trash?

36:06.740 --> 36:08.340
That's what your heart is like right now.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.260
Yeah, it's like a two thirds uneaten pickle.

36:10.260 --> 36:12.980
Yeah, you're better than this.

36:12.980 --> 36:13.460
You're better.

36:13.460 --> 36:13.940
You are.

36:13.940 --> 36:15.220
Yeah, you deserve better than this.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.340
There's somebody out there.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.540
You're in New York.

36:17.540 --> 36:18.020
Okay.

36:18.020 --> 36:21.620
That's that's that's the Windy City, Windy City.

36:21.620 --> 36:24.100
Yeah, but City of Brotherly Love and Big Shoulders.

36:24.100 --> 36:28.900
Get in there and find somebody who is worth your time because this person is not.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.180
And boy, howdy.

36:30.180 --> 36:37.060
If you've never gotten the opportunity to really hardcore reject somebody out.

36:37.060 --> 36:40.260
Oh, man, that's going to do wonders for your yeah, for your ego.

36:40.260 --> 36:45.780
I, I think that it's I mean, I've been through this before.

36:45.780 --> 36:50.260
That person where you see other people going through it and someone like keeps canceling

36:50.260 --> 36:54.260
plans on them and like flaking out and you're like, hey, come on, why is that?

36:54.260 --> 36:55.460
Look at what's happening.

36:55.460 --> 36:59.780
But we've all been in that position before where it's like, you know, things are coming

36:59.780 --> 37:00.100
up.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.460
There's a good excuse here.

37:01.460 --> 37:04.820
Like she had to hang out with her sister tonight, so she had to cancel.

37:06.020 --> 37:09.220
It's always so much harder to see it from the inside.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.500
Yeah, you know, yes.

37:10.500 --> 37:14.580
And so this is us telling you from the outside, get out.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.260
Let us into your heart first.

37:16.260 --> 37:17.220
Let us inside.

37:17.220 --> 37:20.420
And now that we're inside, we're telling you like, hey, this is a mess.

37:20.420 --> 37:23.540
You need to get it sounds like she's a little bit evil.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.780
She's giving you the little bit.

37:25.780 --> 37:27.060
She's giving you the run around.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.820
Why should want to give you the round run around?

37:29.540 --> 37:32.740
I mean, it seems like a surefire way to heat things up, but it seems like all it's doing

37:32.740 --> 37:33.460
is slowing you down.

37:34.100 --> 37:35.060
That's just from us.

37:35.060 --> 37:38.980
But us, us and our friend, John Popper, our dear friend, John Popper.

37:38.980 --> 37:39.780
We all agree.

37:39.780 --> 37:40.100
We talk.

37:40.100 --> 37:40.820
Hey, John.

37:40.820 --> 37:41.540
Hi, John.

37:41.540 --> 37:42.340
Thank you for listening.

37:42.340 --> 37:42.900
Thank you for listening.

37:42.900 --> 37:43.380
Hey, John.

37:43.380 --> 37:46.020
We'll see you right about next week at the Catskills.

37:46.020 --> 37:46.980
Worry about your weight.

37:48.580 --> 37:49.300
Worry about you.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.060
Kind of up and kind of up and down with you.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.980
Up and down, but I hope you're OK.

37:53.780 --> 37:58.500
You need a lot of lung capacity, and it seems like sandwiches aren't helping in that respect.

37:59.300 --> 38:02.740
He's like wicked thin, but like every time he gets super thin, I think, well, that's

38:02.740 --> 38:03.860
a lot more Coke he's doing.

38:03.860 --> 38:07.940
Yeah, and then when he gets super fat, I think, well, I cut back on the Coke, but now I love

38:07.940 --> 38:10.580
sandwiches, so I don't know what to do with John.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.940
It seems like Coke and sandwiches are giving him the run around.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.420
Why do they want to give him the round run around?

38:17.380 --> 38:20.260
Ironically, if every once in a while he would just get up and run around,

38:20.260 --> 38:23.380
he would probably sit down a little bit, which would be really good for him.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.380
Yeah, but then the then the Coke brings him back.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.000
Sure.

38:28.660 --> 38:29.460
Stop it, Griffin.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.940
Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in if you're into tanner rambling.

38:35.700 --> 38:36.500
Uh huh.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.220
Come on, Griffin.

38:37.220 --> 38:37.940
You know all the words.

38:37.940 --> 38:38.340
I don't.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.340
Please don't pretend like you don't know all the words.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.540
You do you want to do it?

38:41.540 --> 38:41.940
Go for it.

38:41.940 --> 38:42.260
I don't.

38:42.260 --> 38:42.500
Go for it.

38:42.500 --> 38:42.980
I don't know it.

38:43.620 --> 38:48.820
I get the I get the rap break of that song and the rap break of one week makes up in

38:48.820 --> 38:53.540
my head because in my head, Blues Traveler and Barenaked Ladies are just one big blob of.

38:54.820 --> 38:57.540
Blue naked average music of drug addiction.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.500
Griffin, you know what I mean?

39:02.500 --> 39:03.140
Don't hold back.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.380
Are you talking about Yahoo?

39:05.380 --> 39:10.660
Uh, no, I'm talking about a French kiss from a Parisian lady.

39:10.660 --> 39:11.940
Yes, I'm talking about Yahoo.

39:12.580 --> 39:13.140
I'm ready.

39:13.140 --> 39:13.940
Here comes Yahoo.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.540
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

39:15.540 --> 39:16.260
Thank you, Lisa.

39:16.260 --> 39:19.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Steveman3015.

39:21.780 --> 39:23.380
That's a pretty good username.

39:23.940 --> 39:24.420
Yeah.

39:24.420 --> 39:34.180
Who asks, um, this, what would happen if Uncle Jesse, in parentheses, John Stamos, from full

39:34.180 --> 39:38.580
house, do if he got shorted a nugget at McDonald's.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.220
Say he orders a 20 piece nugget.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.260
He receives his order.

39:44.260 --> 39:47.460
He counts the nuggets and he sees he only received 19 of them.

39:47.460 --> 39:48.100
What would he do?

39:50.260 --> 39:54.180
Now, this, this could just be a thought exercise that this guy's doing, but I would like to

39:54.180 --> 40:00.180
think that like this man has Steveman has been shorted a nugget and he's like, I don't

40:00.180 --> 40:01.220
know what to do.

40:01.220 --> 40:01.700
That's right.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.020
Where can I look for advice towards John Stamos?

40:04.020 --> 40:05.620
Uncle Jesse from full house.

40:05.620 --> 40:11.380
His, his w w u j f f h d bracelet.

40:12.100 --> 40:17.700
I, I think that John Stamos would get really mad at the person behind the counter, but

40:17.700 --> 40:20.180
then after a moment's thought, he would have mercy.

40:21.140 --> 40:21.620
Jesus.

40:24.580 --> 40:26.420
I think, I think he would have mercy.

40:26.420 --> 40:27.300
Give me another nugget.

40:27.300 --> 40:32.820
I think he would, um, I think he would get up and he would leave the, he would leave

40:32.820 --> 40:37.860
the McDonald's restaurant because he's god damn Stamos.

40:38.420 --> 40:41.700
Why the hell is he at McDonald's ordering chicken nuggets?

40:41.700 --> 40:42.340
Yeah.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.860
He could be eating chicken nuggets.

40:43.860 --> 40:46.740
Oh, Rebecca remains back instead.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.500
He's there and McDonald's buying.

40:48.500 --> 40:52.820
Maybe this person was writing some really shitty fan fiction and they're like, well,

40:52.820 --> 40:53.540
I'm stumped.

40:54.340 --> 40:55.380
I've hit a wall.

40:55.380 --> 40:58.020
I don't know where to go with this story next.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.020
Like, I, I.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.260
Maybe you can choose your own adventure starring John Stamos.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.980
I know I'm onto something with the missing nugget.

41:05.940 --> 41:07.380
Pretty sure that's a pretty deep name.

41:07.380 --> 41:10.660
Have you guys read that new book, John Stamos and the Case of the Missing Nugget?

41:10.660 --> 41:11.620
You know what I bet happened.

41:12.180 --> 41:14.500
I bet Comet got up on the table and nibbled it.

41:17.140 --> 41:18.020
I'm just kidding.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.780
Comet's dead as fuck, everybody.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.300
And then Michelle looked over and said, how wound?

41:24.420 --> 41:25.060
And it was adorable.

41:25.060 --> 41:27.060
No, she didn't, Travis.

41:27.060 --> 41:31.140
Cause she's 35 fucking years old now and John Stamos is dead.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.500
And that was Stephanie, you dumb, you dumb bitch.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.780
Hey, hey Justin.

41:35.780 --> 41:38.580
It was an interchangeable catchphrase that both of them said.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.420
That's uncorrect.

41:40.420 --> 41:41.380
It is correct.

41:41.940 --> 41:44.180
You are an asshole and a liar.

41:44.180 --> 41:48.580
You sir, you have slandered me for the last time.

41:48.580 --> 41:49.780
Full house trivia.

41:49.780 --> 42:00.020
Michelle, did you know that Ashley Olsen and Mary Kay Olsen had to wear flippers?

42:00.020 --> 42:03.060
They had to wear false teeth because they came in at different speeds.

42:03.060 --> 42:04.180
You didn't know that, did you?

42:04.180 --> 42:04.820
Well, now you do.

42:05.380 --> 42:09.540
Did you know that on that show, one kid was played by two kids and then two kids are played

42:09.540 --> 42:10.260
by three kids?

42:10.820 --> 42:16.180
Did you guys know that who could name the original name of Full House?

42:17.380 --> 42:22.020
That's originally called House of Comics was the original bitch and it was not a good name.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.100
Sourdough Sweethearts was the original name of the show.

42:27.940 --> 42:29.220
What's with all these dudes?

42:29.220 --> 42:30.340
Yeah.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.380
Yeah, you know what the weirdest thing about Full House is?

42:33.380 --> 42:38.580
If the mom wasn't dead, it would be the weirdest goddamn show on television.

42:38.580 --> 42:40.660
Have you guys seen the new episode of Lazy Uncles?

42:44.500 --> 42:47.140
At one point, one of them was living in the living room.

42:47.140 --> 42:49.380
They just like strung up a sheet and that was his bedroom.

42:49.380 --> 42:53.460
The theme song originally went, everywhere you look, there's an uncle.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.900
There are uncles fucking everywhere.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.140
And you know what's even weirder?

42:59.140 --> 43:01.300
Only Uncle Jesse was related by blood.

43:01.300 --> 43:02.100
Joey was just there.

43:02.100 --> 43:02.900
Just there.

43:02.900 --> 43:06.740
There's a fucking embarrassment of uncles in this household.

43:06.740 --> 43:08.100
A murder of uncles.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.500
That was actually the first title of the show.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.980
The original title was a murder of uncles.

43:15.780 --> 43:21.460
Do you know that for seven years, Joey Gladstone would meet a woman at a bar and she would say,

43:21.460 --> 43:23.140
should we go back to your place?

43:23.140 --> 43:25.780
And he would say, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

43:25.780 --> 43:29.700
I live with my friend and his brother-in-law and his three daughters

43:29.700 --> 43:33.460
and my brother-in-law's wife and their twin sons and our dog.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.700
And Kimmy Gibbler from time to time.

43:35.700 --> 43:41.700
And Kimmy Gibbler occasionally and also all of my puppets and Popeye toys.

43:41.700 --> 43:42.100
Right.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.260
And I have to record the Rush Hour Renegades.

43:44.260 --> 43:45.620
I just probably get going.

43:45.620 --> 43:48.820
You know, if that show recorded today, Rush Hour Renegades would be a podcast, right?

43:48.820 --> 43:50.820
And I don't need the competition for it.

43:50.820 --> 43:51.300
That's true.

43:51.860 --> 43:53.380
And maybe the Smash Club.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.260
Is that it?

43:54.260 --> 43:54.740
The Smash Club?

43:54.740 --> 43:56.180
The Smash Club lives in their house?

43:57.380 --> 43:58.420
I thought so.

43:58.420 --> 44:02.420
I felt like that show was like some kind of horrific like MC Escher drawing

44:02.420 --> 44:03.860
where no one could escape the house.

44:04.420 --> 44:08.900
Like Uncle Jesse got married and had twins and they put him in the attic.

44:08.900 --> 44:09.380
Yeah.

44:09.380 --> 44:11.620
Well, like some kind of crazy aunt.

44:11.620 --> 44:18.820
Let's also remember that Jesse's last name changed midstream and no one commented on it.

44:18.820 --> 44:19.140
It did?

44:19.140 --> 44:21.780
So I'm not sure logic and reason hold sway in this.

44:21.780 --> 44:22.180
True.

44:22.180 --> 44:24.900
How do you know so fucking much about Full House Train?

44:24.900 --> 44:28.900
It used to be Jesse Cochran, but John Stamos wanted something that sounded more Greek.

44:28.900 --> 44:29.140
Yeah.

44:29.140 --> 44:29.860
More true to his hair.

44:29.860 --> 44:33.620
So he picked the most Greek name that there is on the earth.

44:33.620 --> 44:34.340
Yeah, right.

44:34.340 --> 44:37.540
A Stephanopoulos hero, mustache back hair.

44:38.980 --> 44:39.540
Please.

44:39.540 --> 44:40.420
Can that be my name?

44:41.620 --> 44:45.620
Hey, I've been dating someone for a month now

44:45.620 --> 44:49.940
and I've just been given a things have been moving too fast for me type speech

44:49.940 --> 44:52.900
with accompanying positive comments about me and the relationship

44:52.900 --> 44:54.740
alongside their request to slow things down.

44:55.300 --> 45:00.180
Granted, we do have a high level of emotional and physical intimacy after only 30 days.

45:00.180 --> 45:03.060
But is there any translation of this kind of talk that actually means

45:03.060 --> 45:05.300
let's take things slower and work this out?

45:05.300 --> 45:07.140
Or is this just the beginning of the ending?

45:07.140 --> 45:09.780
And this is from no one to fold them.

45:09.780 --> 45:11.780
And a little bit of additional details here.

45:12.420 --> 45:15.620
This is from a girl talking about the guy she was dating.

45:15.620 --> 45:16.660
Oh, interesting.

45:16.660 --> 45:17.860
That flips it.

45:17.860 --> 45:20.820
So this is the guy had the speech of we're moving too fast.

45:22.660 --> 45:25.460
I would suspect, and this is my cynical opinion,

45:25.460 --> 45:29.460
but I would suspect that the guy says that because, you know,

45:29.460 --> 45:33.220
he's not ready for that kind of commitment and wants to kind of look around.

45:34.420 --> 45:35.060
I'm not sure.

45:35.060 --> 45:35.560
I'm not.

45:36.340 --> 45:37.220
I don't know, Trav.

45:37.220 --> 45:39.620
I think this might be the one case where, like,

45:39.620 --> 45:45.060
I know coded language is huge in relationships and I get it.

45:45.060 --> 45:47.220
And I know it's like it's value.

45:47.220 --> 45:50.020
But maybe this is a situation where taking it face value.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.540
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

45:52.340 --> 45:56.260
You know, if you get spooked and you start trying to hold on tighter,

45:56.260 --> 45:58.900
that is certainly not going to alleviate this problem.

45:58.900 --> 46:00.900
Yeah, you know, I completely agree.

46:00.900 --> 46:03.540
I think that, you know, now that you've said that,

46:03.540 --> 46:06.740
I think the worst thing to do is to try to read into it and try it.

46:06.740 --> 46:08.980
Because you look at it one of two ways.

46:08.980 --> 46:10.900
A, take it at face value and it is true.

46:10.900 --> 46:13.380
And he just wants to slow down and kind of take it slow, not rush it.

46:13.380 --> 46:18.660
B, he's not sure and he's kind of doubting if it's going to work out.

46:19.460 --> 46:22.660
Like, either way, play it cool.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.580
Do what you do and don't worry about it.

46:24.580 --> 46:28.660
Because if you try to rush it and you try to push and pull him closer,

46:28.660 --> 46:29.780
that's going to scare him away.

46:30.500 --> 46:34.660
And otherwise, you're completely going against what he's just asked to do.

46:34.660 --> 46:37.060
I'm going to give an informed opinion on this.

46:37.060 --> 46:40.180
I'm going to need to know a whole lot more about that physical intimacy.

46:40.180 --> 46:44.820
Yeah, Griffin needs you to describe, like, what's the lettuce doing?

46:44.820 --> 46:45.540
Yeah.

46:45.540 --> 46:48.020
Yeah, break it down like you were making a sandwich.

46:49.220 --> 46:51.940
Which one of you is the baps?

46:54.260 --> 46:58.020
Can I also say, and now I stand by the advice we have given.

46:58.020 --> 47:00.180
I think that that's the right play here.

47:00.180 --> 47:04.820
But I don't understand people who want to slow it down.

47:04.820 --> 47:06.180
I don't get it.

47:06.180 --> 47:14.420
Like, are you a different species whose lifespan is not already, like, cosmically insignificant?

47:14.420 --> 47:18.420
If all of human history were a football field,

47:18.420 --> 47:22.500
your life would be a blade of grass at the end of the end zone.

47:22.500 --> 47:25.700
Like, you don't have time to slow it down.

47:26.500 --> 47:27.940
Mine would be the goalpost.

47:29.060 --> 47:29.560
Yes.

47:30.260 --> 47:31.780
I lead a pretty important life.

47:31.780 --> 47:38.900
Your birth and eventual life achievements are the end point, the end game of human evolution.

47:38.900 --> 47:39.860
Everybody knows that.

47:39.860 --> 47:41.140
But for the rest of us.

47:41.140 --> 47:42.100
Oh, for everyone else.

47:42.100 --> 47:43.380
For the rest of us, plebs.

47:44.260 --> 47:48.740
Tim Tebow actually believes that it's like everything past the 20 yard line.

47:48.740 --> 47:49.540
It's like a whole bunch.

47:52.020 --> 47:53.060
Is that a Tim Tebow joke?

47:53.060 --> 47:57.460
That is a very, very obscure Tim Tebow evolution joke.

47:58.340 --> 47:58.900
Okay, great.

47:58.900 --> 48:04.340
I think that it just seems like when you're in a relationship and you met someone you really

48:04.340 --> 48:09.780
connected with and you have this passion and emotion, it just seems like the idea of saying,

48:09.780 --> 48:13.540
like, we need to slow down completely goes against everything.

48:13.540 --> 48:17.460
Like, hey, this is going so good and we're having a great time, so let's ruin it.

48:17.460 --> 48:18.420
Yeah, the best-

48:18.420 --> 48:20.420
Wait, see, now I'm flipping on this.

48:20.420 --> 48:20.920
Yeah.

48:20.920 --> 48:22.100
Like, why?

48:22.100 --> 48:26.900
Why should you be in a relationship with somebody who doesn't want more of a relationship with you?

48:26.900 --> 48:29.060
More of a relationship with you.

48:29.060 --> 48:30.980
And this is completely a personal thing.

48:30.980 --> 48:32.900
I just don't get it.

48:32.900 --> 48:36.420
If you like the person and you're getting along well, what are you waiting for?

48:36.420 --> 48:37.780
Yeah, why are you slowing down?

48:37.780 --> 48:39.300
Like, are you afraid you're going to use it all up?

48:39.300 --> 48:42.500
Let me play devil's advocate here because there is such thing as moving too fast.

48:42.500 --> 48:43.460
Like, let's not be...

48:43.460 --> 48:47.620
Like, if this person, and I'm not saying the listener, I'm sure they have a good head on

48:47.620 --> 48:52.660
their shoulders, but if you can move it too fast and be like, hey, baby names.

48:52.660 --> 48:54.020
Like, we've been dating three weeks.

48:54.580 --> 48:55.940
It's not baby name time.

48:55.940 --> 49:00.420
So maybe we don't know the extent to how fast this thing is, how fast this bullet train is moving.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.300
Counterpoint though, I think that you can...

49:03.300 --> 49:07.140
And maybe this is why he said it, and I think this is the way to look at it.

49:07.140 --> 49:12.420
The only way you can move too fast is if you're moving too fast for one of the people in the

49:12.420 --> 49:12.920
relationship.

49:13.540 --> 49:18.900
So I think it's not that there is a set speed that every relationship should move at,

49:18.900 --> 49:26.340
and it's like a template everyone should follow, but it might be that it is moving too fast for him

49:26.340 --> 49:27.220
and fine for you.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.940
Okay, here's what you do.

49:29.940 --> 49:31.060
I got this.

49:31.060 --> 49:32.100
I got this solved.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.940
I think we're close to giving good advice on this.

49:33.940 --> 49:34.440
So...

49:34.440 --> 49:36.260
I know, we're looping around the bend.

49:36.260 --> 49:42.340
I think you need to slow it down maybe even more than that person wants and make them really

49:42.340 --> 49:44.500
think about what they want out of the relationship.

49:44.500 --> 49:48.820
Slow it down to the point where, you know, the phone calls don't come as often, and that

49:48.820 --> 49:50.180
if they want out, let them get out.

49:50.180 --> 49:55.220
But if you pull back on some of the stuff, some of that good, good loving, both emotional

49:55.220 --> 49:58.020
and physical, then they're gonna realize what they've been missing.

49:59.060 --> 49:59.540
Let me say...

49:59.540 --> 50:00.980
And maybe that's all it takes.

50:00.980 --> 50:05.460
I don't think that him telling you this, like being open and saying that things are moving

50:05.460 --> 50:09.860
too fast for him, I don't think that is as bad as him not telling you that but still

50:09.860 --> 50:10.580
acting on it.

50:12.100 --> 50:15.300
Everybody's had that happen to them, and it sucks where they just stop returning your

50:15.300 --> 50:18.900
calls or they, you know, they try to slow it down with actions instead of telling you,

50:18.900 --> 50:21.860
like, straight up, I feel uncomfortable with this.

50:21.860 --> 50:26.420
I think that that is better than them just acting like it and not telling you and you

50:26.420 --> 50:28.020
thinking that they just don't like you anymore.

50:29.620 --> 50:30.900
Just, yeah, slow it down.

50:30.900 --> 50:31.700
Pump the brakes a little bit.

50:32.660 --> 50:33.300
Pump the brakes.

50:33.300 --> 50:33.940
Don't be afraid.

50:35.060 --> 50:35.700
Don't be afraid.

50:36.740 --> 50:37.700
Don't be afraid.

50:38.900 --> 50:39.540
Shh.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.340
We're here for you.

50:40.340 --> 50:41.380
I take good care of you.

50:42.740 --> 50:43.620
Hand me that lettuce.

50:43.620 --> 50:49.620
Um, let's, let's continue this serious streak by jumping into a very, very serious Yahoo.

50:49.620 --> 50:51.460
It was sent in by Daniel Parker.

50:51.460 --> 50:52.180
Thank you, Daniel.

50:53.380 --> 51:03.380
It's, it's by Yahoo Answers user PokeFanJeremy who asks seriously, do you consider a Pokémon

51:03.380 --> 51:04.740
fetish as bestiality?

51:08.260 --> 51:10.420
I was arguing with my friends about that.

51:10.420 --> 51:13.780
I was saying, no, it's not as Pokémon are based off of animals.

51:13.780 --> 51:17.220
They are fictional and are not considered bestiality.

51:17.220 --> 51:20.580
They say that Pokémon are like 90% animal.

51:20.580 --> 51:22.820
So that makes it count as bestiality.

51:22.820 --> 51:23.780
What do you think?

51:23.780 --> 51:25.940
And BTW, no mean comments.

51:25.940 --> 51:27.140
I do not need them here.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.300
Yeah, you do not here.

51:29.300 --> 51:30.900
I think, I think you do.

51:30.900 --> 51:36.420
I think, I think PokeFanJeremy might have a vested interest in this discussion.

51:36.420 --> 51:45.220
I'm, I don't think this is just a logistical exercise for, I like, I enjoy that PokeFanJeremy

51:45.220 --> 51:49.220
felt the need to clarify that he was arguing that it wasn't bestiality.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.300
I think we could have inferred that.

51:51.300 --> 51:53.060
Yeah, we know the side of the argument.

51:53.060 --> 51:54.500
You're on Jeremy.

51:55.300 --> 51:59.140
I think, um, the, the, I don't know.

51:59.140 --> 52:03.940
It's sort of a damn if you do, damn if you don't like it's either bestiality or a sexual

52:03.940 --> 52:04.660
obsession.

52:04.660 --> 52:09.220
Or a sexual obsession with Japanese space monsters.

52:09.220 --> 52:11.140
Yeah, wouldn't you rather be bestiality?

52:11.140 --> 52:13.220
I think I would rather it be bestiality.

52:13.220 --> 52:15.780
Because then I could like go to conventions and stuff.

52:15.780 --> 52:20.420
I imagine the Pokémon fetish or community could probably fit in a very, very small room.

52:20.420 --> 52:21.700
Christ, I hope that that lasts.

52:21.700 --> 52:26.660
I'm willing to bet that if you go to the bestiality conventions and you, you reveal that the animal

52:26.660 --> 52:28.500
you're attracted to is Pokémon.

52:28.500 --> 52:28.820
Yeah.

52:28.820 --> 52:30.580
You're not welcome back to the conference.

52:30.580 --> 52:35.060
I'm sorry to disagree with you Griffin, but a Pokémon fetish convention takes up a very,

52:35.060 --> 52:36.100
very big space.

52:36.100 --> 52:37.300
It's called PAX East.

52:39.460 --> 52:40.820
Buzzing.

52:40.820 --> 52:42.340
That's probably not true.

52:43.380 --> 52:44.740
Pokémon are still a thing, right?

52:46.980 --> 52:50.740
The magic of Pokémon is still very much alive in some people's hearts.

52:50.740 --> 52:51.380
Okay.

52:51.380 --> 52:53.700
So can I get a, can I get a verdict on this?

52:53.700 --> 52:55.220
Like, can we actually rule on this?

52:55.220 --> 52:58.420
Is, is Pokémon, I mean, I'm going to say they're, they're beasts.

52:58.420 --> 53:01.540
Can we get the logical in nature, but they're still beasts, right?

53:01.540 --> 53:04.100
Let's get some opinions from the, uh, the peanut gallery.

53:04.100 --> 53:07.940
There's actually only one answer, but it was elected as the best answer chosen by voters.

53:08.820 --> 53:13.220
I think that it isn't and shouldn't be considered bestiality because of four reasons.

53:13.220 --> 53:19.860
One, like you said, one, God, one, like you said, they are based off of real animals.

53:19.860 --> 53:22.180
Two, it's not like you are having sex with them.

53:22.180 --> 53:23.380
They are fictional.

53:24.900 --> 53:25.460
I don't know.

53:25.460 --> 53:26.740
I think you could thread that needle.

53:26.740 --> 53:32.260
Three, even if they are 90% animal, having a lot of Pokémon is like having a lot of pets.

53:32.260 --> 53:35.220
Four, loving Pokémon and having a lot of them.

53:35.220 --> 53:35.780
Hold on.

53:35.780 --> 53:36.100
Yeah.

53:36.100 --> 53:40.340
Number three is saying it's cool because it's not bestiality if you bone your pets.

53:40.340 --> 53:40.660
Yeah.

53:40.660 --> 53:41.780
That's just great.

53:41.780 --> 53:44.020
That's caught me.

53:44.020 --> 53:47.300
Um, four loving Pokémon and having a lot of them is like being a cat lady.

53:47.300 --> 53:50.500
If you love cats and own 20 of them, does that mean that you have a cat fetish and

53:50.500 --> 53:51.940
it should be considered bestiality?

53:52.500 --> 53:55.940
Those are my four reasons why a fetish for Pokémon shouldn't be considered bestiality.

53:55.940 --> 53:59.060
Sources, my perspective.

53:59.940 --> 54:02.020
What did you do your doctorate on?

54:02.020 --> 54:04.100
Actually, I did my doctorate on whether or not Pokémon...

54:04.100 --> 54:04.980
I did it on a Yahoo!

54:04.980 --> 54:06.180
Answers forum.

54:06.180 --> 54:08.500
It was a five-part dissertation on...

54:08.500 --> 54:12.100
It's, uh, it's my, my capstone is called fucking Charmander.

54:12.100 --> 54:20.820
Um, the word fetish means not like you're really into it and interested in them and

54:20.820 --> 54:25.780
a collector and a fan, it means that you cannot become sexually aroused unless they are present.

54:25.780 --> 54:26.420
Right.

54:27.060 --> 54:31.140
So it's not like being a cat lady and owning a bunch of cats.

54:31.140 --> 54:33.700
It's like masturbating to a Pokémon poster.

54:33.700 --> 54:34.020
Yeah.

54:34.020 --> 54:38.580
It's not like I, I really like watching Gentle Ben.

54:38.580 --> 54:40.020
So I'm bestiality.

54:40.020 --> 54:42.660
No, like, just liking animals isn't the same thing.

54:42.660 --> 54:43.940
It's, it's completely different.

54:44.580 --> 54:46.420
It's like you like to sex them.

54:46.420 --> 54:48.020
You want to sex the Pokémon.

54:48.020 --> 54:49.380
You want to sex the Pokémon.

54:49.380 --> 54:50.100
And as I know...

54:50.100 --> 54:52.660
You look around and you choose them for sexing.

54:52.660 --> 54:53.060
Yeah.

54:53.060 --> 54:57.540
I don't want to be a stickler about this, but if you want to have sex with Pokémon,

54:57.540 --> 55:00.740
it doesn't really matter what label you put on it.

55:00.740 --> 55:01.300
Yeah.

55:01.300 --> 55:02.260
You're not, you're not going to...

55:02.980 --> 55:06.900
It's not like you need to make it easy to explain to your grandparents, okay?

55:06.900 --> 55:07.060
Like...

55:08.020 --> 55:09.780
For the last time, grandma.

55:09.780 --> 55:10.420
Okay.

55:10.420 --> 55:11.780
Listen, just follow me here.

55:11.780 --> 55:12.260
Just follow me.

55:12.260 --> 55:13.860
It's not bestiality.

55:13.860 --> 55:15.780
It's not weird like that.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.700
I just want to fuck Charmander.

55:17.700 --> 55:20.420
I just want to fuck his brains out.

55:20.420 --> 55:21.220
Is that okay?

55:21.220 --> 55:24.900
Except he's a fire type, that would probably be pretty, probably be pretty uncomfortable

55:24.900 --> 55:26.340
on your, on your business region.

55:27.380 --> 55:27.620
Yeah.

55:29.460 --> 55:30.580
That is simply ghastly.

55:30.580 --> 55:32.900
Do you guys think that Herman Cain has this?

55:35.300 --> 55:36.660
He's got a poke addiction?

55:38.980 --> 55:39.220
Yeah.

55:39.780 --> 55:47.540
No, I think he appreciates Pokémon for their, for their, the allegory to the humanity struggles.

55:47.540 --> 55:52.740
I guess, but I think that eventually that morphs, that metamorphs into sexual frustration.

55:53.620 --> 55:54.340
Well, yes.

55:54.340 --> 55:56.500
Why can't, just why can't I fuck Squirtle?

55:57.220 --> 55:57.860
That's a good question.

55:57.860 --> 55:58.580
It's right there.

55:58.580 --> 55:59.940
It's right there on my Game Boy.

56:01.460 --> 56:02.580
It's so close, it's so far.

56:02.580 --> 56:04.020
It's right there on my Game Boy Color.

56:04.020 --> 56:04.820
It's so vivid.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.340
I'm going to close the lid on my wiener.

56:09.380 --> 56:10.260
That's life.

56:10.260 --> 56:14.100
Hey, listen, thank you so much for joining us again for another episode.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.340
You can find us at nbmbam.com.

56:16.340 --> 56:20.500
Don't forget there are forums at maximumfun.org where you can go and discuss the show.

56:21.220 --> 56:25.700
And where you can also go to download all the other wonderful maximumfun.org podcasts.

56:25.700 --> 56:34.340
You need to grab the new episode of Jesse Thorn's show Bullseye, which is a, sort of a, a, a new

56:34.340 --> 56:37.140
branding for The Sound of Young America is called Bullseye now.

56:37.140 --> 56:38.900
And we were on the last episode.

56:38.900 --> 56:41.140
We did a segment about pop culture advice.

56:41.140 --> 56:45.940
And if you would listen to that, and if you like it, maybe send Jesse a note and say,

56:45.940 --> 56:47.700
Hey, I really like this.

56:47.700 --> 56:49.060
Let's, let's have it again.

56:49.060 --> 56:50.980
Cause I I'm, I'm enjoying it very much.

56:50.980 --> 56:51.220
Yes.

56:51.220 --> 56:55.220
Because we're enjoying being real famous and not just like you people famous.

56:55.220 --> 57:01.060
Yeah, you can actually hear, also hear that show on some NPR stations and it's on, uh,

57:01.060 --> 57:02.100
XM public radio.

57:02.100 --> 57:03.940
So radio guys heard of it.

57:04.660 --> 57:05.700
I bet you have.

57:05.700 --> 57:05.940
Yeah.

57:05.940 --> 57:06.500
Radio.

57:07.700 --> 57:08.660
I want a new thing.

57:08.660 --> 57:09.700
It's sweeping me up.

57:09.700 --> 57:11.540
I want a new thing is sweeping the nation.

57:12.340 --> 57:16.020
I want to thank, uh, John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song.

57:16.020 --> 57:19.460
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed, which it seems like in the past

57:19.460 --> 57:24.260
week or two, like I've gotten like 50 people who are like, Hey, I bought that album.

57:24.260 --> 57:25.060
It's super good.

57:25.620 --> 57:26.740
Um, it is super good.

57:26.740 --> 57:27.700
You should buy it.

57:27.700 --> 57:31.300
Also, if you haven't listened to Roderick on the line, it's a John Roderick and Merlin

57:31.300 --> 57:32.500
Mann's new podcasts.

57:32.500 --> 57:33.780
That shit's super good too.

57:33.780 --> 57:38.500
It's not on the max fun network, but, um, although the max fun network is adding a new

57:38.500 --> 57:41.140
show, so we don't know what we haven't heard yet.

57:41.140 --> 57:46.340
It's a secret, but, uh, we're getting a new brother, a new little brother, a sister, uh,

57:46.340 --> 57:46.900
very soon.

57:46.900 --> 57:49.460
So does this mean that Jesse will love us less?

57:49.460 --> 57:50.020
Yeah.

57:50.020 --> 57:50.500
Yeah.

57:50.500 --> 57:54.980

Oh, and, uh, I have a new show.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.020
It's about television.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.220
I do it with my wife, Sydney.

58:45.220 --> 58:46.180
It's called the satellite.

58:46.180 --> 58:48.260
It's called satellite dish with Justin and Sydney.

58:48.260 --> 58:50.420
You can find it on iTunes and get it there.

58:50.420 --> 58:52.980
Ross on Twitter at the sat dish.

58:52.980 --> 58:57.540
And I also have another podcast called in case of emergency where we talk about five

58:57.540 --> 59:00.420
step plans to survive all kinds of different emergencies.

59:00.420 --> 59:01.220
Check it out.

59:01.220 --> 59:02.340
I also have a podcast call.

59:02.340 --> 59:06.420
I wish my fucking brothers would focus on one show at once and give it all the attention

59:06.420 --> 59:09.700
that it needs so it can grow into the multimedia empire that I want it to become.

59:09.700 --> 59:12.900
And they obviously don't because they're fucking doing other shit instead of the shit

59:12.900 --> 59:13.460
that I'm on.

59:14.260 --> 59:15.300
That's on Twitter too.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.020
That's on Twitter.

59:16.020 --> 59:17.700
So Facebook it and tumble.

59:18.500 --> 59:18.820
Grindr.

59:18.820 --> 59:24.900
This final, this final, this final grinder question was sent in by Galiayali.

59:24.900 --> 59:31.860
It's by Yahoo Answers user Harlemkid82485 who asks, was anybody else touched by the

59:31.860 --> 59:33.460
curious case of Benjamin Button?

59:37.860 --> 59:39.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:40.260 --> 59:41.700
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:41.700 --> 59:42.740
Kiss your dad.

59:42.740 --> 59:43.860
Swear on the lips.

59:48.260 --> 59:50.020
Keep your heart, three stacks.

59:50.020 --> 59:50.980
Keep your heart.

59:50.980 --> 59:53.140
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

59:53.140 --> 59:54.180
Keep your heart.

59:54.180 --> 59:55.460
Man, these girls are smart.

59:55.460 --> 59:57.300
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.620
Play your part.
