WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.880 --> 00:58.240
As predicted, the favorites came out on top. We were there for every play, every catch, every kick,

00:58.240 --> 01:03.920
every run, every catch run where you catch it and then run it. You're talking about the puppy bowl,

01:03.920 --> 01:09.360
right? The puppy bowl was scintillating, but all we could think was how could we make this

01:09.360 --> 01:12.960
a little bit wiser? Why do we think this way? Because we're my brother, my brother and me,

01:12.960 --> 01:18.000
an advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am the

01:18.000 --> 01:24.720
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm the baby Griffin. You little guy pie. You little scamp.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.760
What do you guys, who are we picking? Well, since we watched the game last night,

01:34.640 --> 01:40.640
I gotta say from the beginning, I believed in insert winning team here, and I really knew that

01:40.640 --> 01:46.800
their quarterback, I don't know either of their names, could do it. Really? You don't know catches?

01:46.800 --> 01:52.320
You don't know either? Rothlisberger is one of them. Rothlisberger? Good, Travis. And catch

01:52.320 --> 02:01.600
touchdown. Oh, I like that one. Yeah. Pigskin Pete, the run quarterback. Brock Yardgain.

02:03.040 --> 02:08.160
Hi, I'm Brock Yardgain. I'm here speaking to you for athlete cream. You put it on your hands and

02:08.160 --> 02:15.040
feet to make you run harder and catch harder. I'm going to make an actual prediction because

02:15.040 --> 02:18.960
if it comes true, I want people to think I'm some sort of mad sports prophet. I'm going to say

02:20.960 --> 02:28.560
Packers by 16, but all 16 points are from safeties. Wow. They're going to get eight safeties in a row

02:28.560 --> 02:35.680
because the Steelers are just going to lose their shit. I'm actually going to predict Steelers,

02:35.680 --> 02:41.120
but because the Packers are a no show. The Packers don't show up. Yeah,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.920
they just don't show up. And everybody's like, well, I guess we'll just call it.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.080
I'm going to pick that one of the Steelers realizes that their team name is grammatically

02:50.080 --> 02:55.440
incorrect. They change it to the Thieves because Steelers. What are you eight?

02:57.120 --> 03:03.200
We're stealing guys. Come on. Come on. Let's all grow up in 2011. How about that? And act

03:03.200 --> 03:09.200
like grownups. Hey, how do you tell a friend she's a slut without seeming rude? I have a friend whose

03:09.200 --> 03:14.320
love life I cannot keep up with because she's actually usually messing around with two or

03:14.320 --> 03:19.920
three guys at one time. I used to think she only did it to get over an ex. But what I've come to

03:19.920 --> 03:25.200
realize is that anytime she's single, this is her romantic lifestyle. Is there a way to discuss a

03:25.200 --> 03:31.680
friend's sluttiness without it hurting anyone's feelings? Or do I have to be the bad guy? I only

03:31.680 --> 03:38.240
want the healthiest life for her. Thanks. Concern in Columbia. Hey, my bim bam. How do I tell my

03:38.240 --> 03:45.520
friend that he's like just super judgmental? I have a friend who's always casting dispersions on

03:45.520 --> 03:52.960
me because I like to get get boot knocking with a few fellas around town. I like to knock knock

03:52.960 --> 03:58.480
several simultaneous pairs of boots in various styles and colors and heights and endowed.

03:58.480 --> 04:04.800
I like that your worry is that this life isn't healthy, which makes me wonder what kind of stuff

04:04.800 --> 04:13.840
she's into. I have this one guy and he just shoves refined sugar down my throat. Nothing.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.520
We eat Cheetos and just drink Mountain Dew to like five in the morning.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.720
And there's lucky there's some light, light petting. You know, it really this is one of

04:26.720 --> 04:31.360
those things like how do I how do I hit my friend in the face without him feeling like he's been

04:31.360 --> 04:39.760
punched? Like it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy here that no one likes to hear that.

04:42.480 --> 04:47.040
But you don't have to say anything like this is completely like your friend's not asking for

04:47.040 --> 04:53.200
advice. Keep it to yourself, bro. I think your general policy should be if your friend is doing

04:53.200 --> 04:58.640
something just terrible, as long as they're not going to like hurt themselves doing it,

04:58.640 --> 05:02.640
just let them collapse in on themselves like a dying star. Like, right. You're going to you're

05:02.640 --> 05:06.800
going to blow up yourself eventually. You don't you don't have to stick your nose in their business.

05:08.320 --> 05:16.320
Yeah, I think that you should redirect your your focus on not telling your friend she's a slut

05:16.320 --> 05:20.640
because that's hurtful language, but maybe trying to make her feel

05:20.640 --> 05:26.720
feel worthwhile and important and make her feel like somebody who doesn't have to go from sexual

05:26.720 --> 05:31.920
relationship to sexual relationship and can, you know, is worthy of something more meaningful.

05:31.920 --> 05:37.040
Maybe she doesn't want that right now. She's a woman. It's 2011. Yeah, she can do what she wants.

05:37.040 --> 05:43.200
Also, I know this is becoming an answer for like 95 percent of our questions, but I think you need

05:43.200 --> 05:49.520
to open up your your eyes and realize that you're in love with her. What's up? What's up? What's up?

05:49.520 --> 05:54.640
What's up? Yeah. How is your eyes? They look so open. Did we do that? I bet we did.

05:56.160 --> 06:01.120
I broke up with my ex-girlfriend about five months ago now, and I'm finally ready to move on

06:01.120 --> 06:05.120
to starting a new relationship. However, I now find myself in quite a pickle.

06:05.680 --> 06:11.600
I have two girls interested in me. Sorry, Griffin. And I'm interested in both of them. I can talk to

06:11.600 --> 06:16.240
both of them for hours and always have an amazing time when I'm with either of them. I've tried pros

06:16.240 --> 06:20.320
and cons list for each potential relationship, but they end up being even and I can't decide

06:20.320 --> 06:25.040
which I should go for. They're both incredibly physically attractive. So just choosing based on

06:25.040 --> 06:30.160
looks isn't an option. Help me, brothers. How do I make this decision? Oh, man, dog.

06:31.520 --> 06:38.640
Rough stuff. Rough, rough stuff. I feel I've never felt so sorry for anybody, I don't think.

06:39.280 --> 06:45.120
Yeah, it's really a sad, sad situation. I watched this documentary on blood diamond miners and like

06:45.120 --> 06:53.760
their shit's fucked, but you have it the worst situation I've ever experienced.

06:54.720 --> 07:03.440
Griffin, you're so you're so young to be so bitter. I think my advice is how I don't know

07:03.440 --> 07:09.040
much about love from my limited amount of time in this world, but I don't believe that you can have

07:09.040 --> 07:18.160
to the ones. So if you're having that hard a time making a decision, maybe neither

07:18.160 --> 07:23.360
relationship is really going to go anywhere. So you should just date both. What about polygamy?

07:23.360 --> 07:29.760
What about getting? Yes, get that sister wife train. Yeah, get with it. Just get. I'm sorry.

07:29.760 --> 07:36.960
One more time. Getting with it. It's cool. It's just two ladies, one man who all love each other

07:36.960 --> 07:41.280
very much. Have you introduced them to each other? What if they get along really well?

07:41.280 --> 07:45.840
What if they get along really well? You know, why don't you date both of them and then date

07:45.840 --> 07:50.960
a couple more and never let them know about each other, but be really nice to all of them.

07:50.960 --> 07:55.520
It's a little move I like to call the Justin. I mean, people in college, they called it the

07:55.520 --> 08:04.000
Justin. Was it for me? It's hard to say, but it was. The Justin, it's a classic.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.040
You could put them through a series of rigorous physical challenges. Physical challenge.

08:11.680 --> 08:19.280
You could set up some sort of amazing race type deal. A big like giant Q-tip fight standing on

08:19.280 --> 08:27.040
top of pillars. That's good. And possibly potentially sexy. Kind of sexy. Pillow fight to

08:27.040 --> 08:34.720
the death. A fight to the death makes your decision for you. Auction yourself off, but

08:34.720 --> 08:40.720
like a private auction between the two of them just to see like how much money they'll give you

08:41.280 --> 08:48.320
to be your girlfriend. Yeah. Because then you get money too and it answers your question.

08:49.200 --> 08:53.840
I gotta say, man, if you have two girls interested in you, you're interested in both of them.

08:53.840 --> 09:02.240
I would imagine, okay, here's what you do. Go to each of them and say, listen, I'm trying to make

09:02.240 --> 09:06.880
some tough decisions right now. Can you give yourself old person makeup? Because I'm trying

09:06.880 --> 09:11.680
to decide how you will look when you're old compared to another girl. And then whichever

09:11.680 --> 09:16.080
one of them looks the hottest old. Take a look at pictures of the great grandmothers

09:16.960 --> 09:21.840
and kind of try to figure it out. Can I see your grandma? Can you take me to meet your grandma?

09:21.840 --> 09:25.920
You got to go deeper, though, because it's not it's not just about looks. Justin, you know,

09:25.920 --> 09:31.040
that you got to ask them to act how they plan on acting when they're old. So you got to ask if

09:31.040 --> 09:36.720
there's a history of Alzheimer's is their dimensions kind of dementia or the scary.

09:36.720 --> 09:41.440
Good, good, good. Let's think of more terrible things to say than the past two things that

09:41.440 --> 09:46.640
we've said, because I don't think that we can think of fresh out. Speaking of terrible people,

09:46.640 --> 09:50.560
Griffin, can you read me a question you've called from the Yahoo answer service?

09:50.560 --> 09:55.520
Hey, hey, why don't I do just that? This one was sent in by Cosmo doodle cat.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.880
Okay, thank you. It's by Yahoo answers user. So who asks,

10:02.480 --> 10:08.080
how do I become a mermaid but but keep my current hairstyle and breast size?

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
I am a wizard who has magical powers. Nobody tells people that. How do I become a mermaid

10:18.000 --> 10:21.600
but keep my current hairstyle and breast size? What spell do I use?

10:21.600 --> 10:27.120
Wait, if I had a dollar for every time, we've got this exact question.

10:27.120 --> 10:36.400
Now, here's the problem. I am well versed in transmogrification, right? Like I can I can tell

10:36.400 --> 10:41.440
you how to become a mermaid. Keeping your current hairstyle and breast size. That's a tricky wicket

10:41.440 --> 10:48.080
because it's not easy to do. A lot of parts just get switched around.

10:48.080 --> 10:55.520
Yeah, it's in the process. There's a lot of variables that unless you're an advanced wizard,

10:55.520 --> 11:00.080
it's going to be hard to control. I mean, you could wake up with three breasts. You could wake

11:00.080 --> 11:05.120
up with inverted breasts and hairstyle. Forget about it. I mean, you're definitely going to be

11:05.120 --> 11:11.360
must. There's going to be a certain level of must thing. Here's my suggestion and I guarantee this

11:11.360 --> 11:19.200
will work. Go to a large body of water, jump into it and swim to the bottom. Now, your body is going

11:19.200 --> 11:23.840
to tell you that it wants to go back up to the top, but that's resisting the transformation.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.880
Just go ahead and stay down there as long as you can and you will wake up a mermaid with the same

11:28.880 --> 11:36.080
hair and breast size. In heaven. A heavenly mermaid. Listen, everybody watches The Little

11:36.080 --> 11:43.680
Mermaid and they think, God damn, those are some sexy fish people. Yeah, I love it. I would like

11:43.680 --> 11:51.200
to know what it would be like to be with one of them or more, but the reality is just wicked

11:51.200 --> 11:59.920
harsh. It's way worse than Disney makes it out to be. There's no sexy clamshell obfuscated

12:00.560 --> 12:08.080
breasts down there. It's just a lot of gills, a lot of scales. Yeah, it's a lot of sliminess,

12:08.080 --> 12:18.160
a lot of just fins. Gil sex is not what you think. You would think, oh, that's great. That's

12:18.160 --> 12:24.400
going to be fantastic. Good workout like that. Not designed for that. Not an entry. It's abrasive

12:24.400 --> 12:33.200
because scales aren't... I don't know. It's not a natural feel. Can you imagine anything worse

12:33.840 --> 12:41.120
than being locked into a prison of being a half fish and having the human soul up top?

12:41.120 --> 12:45.680
Yeah. No matter what your breasts look like and your hairstyle looks like,

12:45.680 --> 12:50.080
you are still going to be half a fish and you're going to be thinking all of your regular human

12:50.080 --> 12:56.480
thoughts, but you're not going to have legs for dancing and jumping. Legs are required.

12:56.480 --> 13:04.080
I don't think you want to do it. Yeah, jumping, dancing. Oh, also... What the fuck's wrong with

13:04.080 --> 13:10.800
you? Hey, are you crazy? My favorite part about the question is that there is no doubt that they

13:10.800 --> 13:18.640
are a wizard, but nobody talks about it. It's just like in Twilight. But that's just drop.

13:19.280 --> 13:23.200
Everybody's going to read and go, well, yeah, of course. But what's spell? Guys,

13:23.200 --> 13:28.560
you're not reading the fucking responses because that's what's happening. What are people saying?

13:30.240 --> 13:35.680
Shay Gray says, any trans species modification spell should work. The trick is you'll need to

13:35.680 --> 13:40.560
use your own genetic material in the working or you'll wind up as a plain old off the shelf mermaid.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.400
Oh, and do be mindful of the duration. If I remember correctly, the standard is seven

13:44.400 --> 13:48.000
days, seven nights, although it must be time perfectly to coincide with the full moon.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.800
If there's no internet, no. Slow down, internet. You're headed for a cliff. Oh, no.

13:56.800 --> 14:02.160
At best you're writing bad fan fiction. At worst, you're convincing a wizard to drown himself.

14:03.200 --> 14:09.120
Where's the accountability? This seems like the kind of thing that you read the newspaper the

14:09.120 --> 14:15.440
next day. This is like young delusional wizard kills self, local wizard kills self.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.040
And a star spangled snuggie dragged to the bottom of the briny deep.

14:20.640 --> 14:29.200
For seven nights, seven days, he drowned himself. Hey, listen, I think my friend is in love with me.

14:30.400 --> 14:35.520
I'm a straight woman. She's a bisexual woman. She's been acting jealous and possessive of me.

14:35.520 --> 14:42.960
We're planning an upcoming vacation. And she steadfastly refuses to allow me to invite anyone

14:42.960 --> 14:47.920
else. I think she wants it to be a romantic getaway for us. She gets upset if and quiet.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.560
If I talk about a guy I'm casually seeing, it's freaking me out. What to do?

14:55.760 --> 15:01.520
God, that's tender. Like that's a tough. So it's like an open wound. It is. It's like there's no

15:01.520 --> 15:06.320
good way. I think that I think you got to go with the Griffin classic on this one.

15:08.880 --> 15:15.440
Fake sick, stay home for vacation. I'm too sick to go on our lady getaway

15:16.720 --> 15:21.840
to the islands. I don't think I can come. I find a really great get out of jail free card

15:21.840 --> 15:28.480
is to say things in a really high voice. So if you're like, hey, I just want to ask you a quick

15:28.480 --> 15:36.160
question. Are you? That's called the the Goldthwait game? Yeah, that's what I like to do. It usually

15:36.160 --> 15:41.760
gets you out of it. You think talking like Bob Goldthwait is going to get her out of this?

15:41.760 --> 15:46.800
Hey, let me ask you a question. I know that you'd like to pursue a

15:46.800 --> 15:52.720
lesbian relationship with me. Are we? Are you planning on boning with me?

15:52.720 --> 16:03.600
Before we begin our sapphic adventures, I do have one request. Do you remember that I'm a straight woman?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.520
I think I don't think we can.

16:10.000 --> 16:17.120
Bisexual or not, like. It's pretty weird. Like if it was weird, right? If it was a fella. Yeah,

16:17.120 --> 16:21.440
we'd say that fella was into you. No, OK, think about it this way. If it's a fella,

16:21.440 --> 16:27.440
right? And you're just friends and he's been acting like he he's into you and then you're

16:27.440 --> 16:33.520
going to go on a vacation with him and you know he's into girls and you know, whatever you whatever

16:33.520 --> 16:39.200
you're into is irrelevant. You're not into him. You're not going to go on the vacation like you're

16:39.200 --> 16:44.240
going to tell the guy like, listen, I really treasure our friendship. We're it's not going

16:44.240 --> 16:50.640
to work. This isn't going to happen. This situation is like. It's not gender specific,

16:50.640 --> 16:55.520
like any person who acts like jealous of you and possessive anytime you talk about a relationship

16:56.080 --> 17:02.320
and like. Doesn't want you to invite anybody else on your potentially romantic getaway.

17:02.320 --> 17:07.440
Like that's that's a that's a problem. Yeah, it is. And it's it's going to be. It's going to be.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.400
You're not going to be able to preserve this friendship unless she makes a decision

17:12.960 --> 17:19.440
to preserve it. You've got to be honest and tell her what's up. And yeah, you need to tell her

17:19.440 --> 17:26.320
what's up. But you're probably right. And even if you're not, if you're feeling that way, like,

17:26.320 --> 17:31.520
that's what matters. Like whether she actually digs you or not, you are uncomfortable in this

17:31.520 --> 17:38.480
friendship. So, yep, exactly. You and you get nothing from asking her because you're already

17:38.480 --> 17:44.720
uncomfortable. Like the only thing that's going to happen is you get more uncomfortable. Yeah.

17:44.720 --> 17:50.560
If all else fails, Bobcat. Yep. Bobcat it up. Just just Bobcat. Hi, brothers. Just wondering

17:50.560 --> 17:57.600
if you could give a shout out to the listeners in North North North North Queensland, Australia.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.280
Just had a rough night getting through the cyclone. And as a question, what are your

18:01.280 --> 18:07.440
tips for the next potential natural disaster? Thanks, guys. And that's from Australia. Well,

18:07.440 --> 18:14.960
hey, guys, you you are in an unfortunate situation. Sounds seems like God's really upset at you all.

18:14.960 --> 18:20.160
And he's taking it out on you a little rough. I think he's being a little a little tough on you.

18:20.160 --> 18:25.760
And I think he needs to chill out. My advice is, well, at least I know that what I do is no matter

18:25.760 --> 18:32.800
what the natural disaster is, stand in a doorway. Does not stand. It doesn't matter what it is. Get

18:32.800 --> 18:39.120
yourself to a fucking doorway and just hold up. They're invincible. There's something about this,

18:39.120 --> 18:45.120
the rectangular structure. It's it can't be breached. Once it really right when it starts,

18:45.120 --> 18:49.600
whatever the disaster is, I find it's really good to raise both of your hands above your head and

18:49.600 --> 18:55.840
say, behold, because that makes it seem like like that makes it kind of fun for everybody. Did Jerry

18:55.840 --> 19:00.560
do it? Did he not? Probably not. But it's kind of funny. Do you remember when Jerry summoned that

19:00.560 --> 19:06.720
cyclone as kind of a dick move? It was a dick move. He got really mad about losing a boggle.

19:06.720 --> 19:13.280
And so he flooded our country. What a jerk is a cyclone. Is that anything like a blizzard,

19:13.280 --> 19:19.520
but only without all the snow? Because if that's the case, I also I could use some some prayers,

19:19.520 --> 19:25.040
I guess, some prayers and some thoughts, send our thoughts. Are you in a pretty bad situation?

19:25.040 --> 19:31.040
I mean, I would say it snowed again last night. Like, thanks. Thanks. Thank you for that. It was

19:31.040 --> 19:36.880
like we just scooped out my car. I was going to go play some board games on Monday, but I guess not.

19:36.880 --> 19:41.120
I guess that's not a thing that I can do anymore. Realistically, Griffin, if I had known you were

19:41.120 --> 19:46.000
suffering like this, I would never brought up these Hammond Eggers in Australia. Yeah. Yeah.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.320
Like what's a cyclone? I used to have a bike, a bicycle that was cyclone brand.

19:50.320 --> 19:55.760
And I'm almost certain that their shit's pretty serious down there. That seems like a pretty

19:55.760 --> 20:06.080
serious thing. Let me Google it. Australia. Oh, yeah. Like way worse, right? Like way,

20:06.080 --> 20:13.760
way worse. Yeah. Let me just let me see this. Oh, no, guys. There's some there is some thunder down

20:13.760 --> 20:22.480
under. Yeah, now it's great now. See, you're making it cool. We've got to stop making we've got to

20:22.480 --> 20:27.040
stop making this natural disaster sound awesome. Or maybe we do make it sound awesome. And that

20:27.040 --> 20:30.240
would be like, you know, if you know what the problem do you know what the real problem is?

20:31.200 --> 20:38.640
What is it? Their cyclones spin the other way. It's impossible to predict. Make sure you give

20:38.640 --> 20:49.040
it to help out with the disaster relief there. You can go to qld.gov.au for floods for donate.html

20:49.040 --> 20:56.480
and you can help pitch in there. And we would encourage you to to to do it. If you want to

20:56.480 --> 21:03.600
send me some money for like salt. Yeah. Salt or a new shovel like a shovel. Shit ain't free.

21:03.600 --> 21:09.440
You know, shit ain't free. How about a yahoo? Yeah. Well, you know what? Shit ain't free.

21:09.440 --> 21:16.480
That actually reminds me. It's time for us to take a real quick break. And so let's let's go now to

21:16.480 --> 21:37.600
the money zone. Hey, Griff, have you bought any games, DVDs, Blu rays or gadgets lately? Hell

21:37.600 --> 21:47.040
no. I can't afford any of that stuff. Who do I look like? Gloria Estefan? No, but I do.

21:53.040 --> 21:59.440
That's right. And when I need a great deal on games, movies and gadgets, I turn to thriftynerd.com.

21:59.440 --> 22:04.320
They comb the internet for great deals on those things and put the best on the front page every

22:04.320 --> 22:10.400
day. Plus, they've got a Twitter feed at thrifty nerd so you can hear about the latest deals on the

22:10.400 --> 22:17.840
go. Awesome. Wait, I haven't told you the best part at thriftynerd.com. You can pay for your

22:17.840 --> 22:25.280
products with Grammys and Latin Grammys. But Gloria, we don't have any Latin Grammys. No,

22:25.280 --> 22:33.760
Griffin. You don't have any Latin Grammys yet. They they do take money too, though, right?

22:33.760 --> 22:40.240
Yes, yes. You can also use money thriftynerd.com where you can buy things with money

22:40.880 --> 22:48.960
and Latin Grammys, but mainly money. Everybody needs games and everybody needs Blu rays.

22:49.520 --> 22:56.560
Thrifty nerd has all those things. Actually, they don't have them, but he knows a guy.

22:56.560 --> 23:10.480
How is that? Dear brothers, dear brothers, I work at a UPS store and numerous times a day people

23:10.480 --> 23:16.720
call just to complain. Not to ask for prices or services, but purely to complain and yell about

23:16.720 --> 23:21.840
something I can't control or help them with. When they start to yell at me, I get the urge to yell

23:21.840 --> 23:27.680
back, but I hold back to keep a good name for the business. Would it be okay every once in a while

23:27.680 --> 23:32.880
to raise my voice back and put the customer in their place? Thanks, brothers. Richie.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.360
I actually have the best advice for this, something I used to do when I worked

23:37.360 --> 23:42.320
a very large electronics retailer. Just get-

23:42.320 --> 23:46.640
Okay, is this gonna be good advice, like real good advice or good advice like that one time

23:46.640 --> 23:53.200
you actually had good advice? I'm gonna golf-quate it. We'll see how it goes.

23:55.520 --> 24:02.640
My advice is this, as they get louder, you get quieter. Just keep lowering your voice more and

24:02.640 --> 24:08.240
more until you're just barely whispering. What purpose does that serve?

24:08.240 --> 24:12.960
Well, A, it makes them feel really loud. Also, it's super creepy. Have you ever heard someone

24:12.960 --> 24:19.120
whisper on the phone? It's what birds do. It's the worst. Yeah, you can't be- you can't-

24:19.120 --> 24:22.880
getting angry at them isn't gonna help anything. They're gonna get angrier and angrier.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.960
The best thing to do is just say, like, you're right, you're so right, and try to be nice,

24:27.680 --> 24:31.600
and they'll feel better, and maybe you'll wind up with, like, a friend, like a new friend.

24:31.600 --> 24:36.080
Yeah, like, ask them to hang out. Like, hey, listen, what are you doing tonight?

24:36.080 --> 24:40.000
Can I make this up to you with a nice dinner? Like, is something wrong? You okay? What's the

24:40.000 --> 24:46.560
matter? You wanna talk about it? You sound- you sound tense. You wanna, you know, massage sesh?

24:46.560 --> 24:52.560
Just- just a little massage. Oh, massage sesh. Massage sesh.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.840
And also, you could also prop yourself up with the knowledge that you're

24:55.840 --> 24:59.680
probably a better person than they are, and they're not really mad at you. You know,

24:59.680 --> 25:03.840
they're mad at your business. It has nothing to do with you, so getting mad back at them

25:03.840 --> 25:08.960
doesn't accomplish anything. You know, you're- you are just there to be a sounding board

25:08.960 --> 25:13.760
for them to call and complain. Here's what you say. You act really nice, and you say,

25:13.760 --> 25:19.600
wow, this is embarrassing. I'm gonna escalate this, and I'm gonna have, uh, someone get back

25:19.600 --> 25:25.280
to you in, and then you end the sentence with exactly how much time it is till the end of your

25:25.280 --> 25:30.320
shift plus five minutes. Yeah. And then you leave, and then it's somebody else's problem.

25:31.840 --> 25:35.120
I think you should just yell back. Whoa, like, yell back at them?

25:35.120 --> 25:39.840
Mm-hmm. What's the worst that can happen? Well, what if you yell back really polite things?

25:40.960 --> 25:44.560
Let me see how I can help you with this! I will try and get this problem fixed for you!

25:46.640 --> 25:49.680
Why do you have to sound like you're having a bowel movement at the same time?

25:50.800 --> 25:55.760
Griffin, I need a Yahoo. This one was sent in by Dilbob. Thank you, Dilbob. It's by Yahoo

25:55.760 --> 26:09.600
answers user DanceDreamer, who asks, what's going on with Egypt? Additional info. Is it a beef?

26:14.480 --> 26:23.280
It is most certainly a beef. Oh, I think some people have a hard time keeping up with what's

26:23.280 --> 26:29.120
going on over there. I think we can just sum it up by saying they just got mad beef.

26:32.000 --> 26:38.080
This government dude is like, he's a heavy, and he's firing all his boys. Yeah, he fired all his

26:38.080 --> 26:46.080
boys, but they don't want the little ones. They want him. They want the big hog. But they can't

26:46.080 --> 26:53.120
get it. So they got beef? He's slurping on the nation's cheddar, and he's pushing

26:53.120 --> 27:00.400
everybody else down. How many like food related? Yeah, hip hop is basically just a culinary class

27:00.400 --> 27:06.240
without any ingredients. That's all it is. Hillary Clinton is going to go over there,

27:06.240 --> 27:12.400
and she's going to say, hey, listen, squash it. Can we please squash it? It's getting out of hand.

27:12.400 --> 27:18.960
We squash it once. Just squash it. You too. Everybody who's fighting, pro-government,

27:18.960 --> 27:25.840
anti-government, just squash it so I can go back to hearing about what those kids from

27:25.840 --> 27:31.040
Jersey Shore are doing on the news rather than hearing about the situation over there. Just

27:31.040 --> 27:37.360
squash it. What people don't realize is the way to solve Egypt's problem is the next time

27:37.360 --> 27:43.200
President Mubarak is out in public, if you hold a cat up to him, he turns into sand and blows away.

27:43.200 --> 27:52.720
What? Wow. No way. I'm thinking of the mummy. Yeah, I know, dog. Wow. It's like super racist.

27:52.720 --> 28:02.720
It wasn't super racist. It's super like Egyptist. It's a little Egyptist for my taste. I'm pretty

28:02.720 --> 28:09.280
sure Egypt's not a race. I'm pretty sure he's just beefing with Egypt in general. It's like a general

28:09.280 --> 28:18.640
Egypt beef. All right. The three of us, do we have any idea what's going on over there between

28:18.640 --> 28:24.320
the three of us? Yeah, I'll try to explain it the best I can. All right. I got beef.

28:26.640 --> 28:32.800
Mad beef. That place is like a wicked big butcher shop with all the beef hanging around.

28:32.800 --> 28:43.440
I, it is indicative of my level of cultural awareness combined with the extent to which

28:43.440 --> 28:48.640
I will buy into a mom mentality. Enough people got together and said, hey, fuck this guy,

28:48.640 --> 28:55.200
and instantly I'm on their side. Yeah. Yeah. They're probably right. Yeah. I've never realized

28:55.200 --> 29:00.880
he lived, existed before, and I think I thought Egypt got like absorbed into one of those bigger

29:00.880 --> 29:06.640
countries. It's like Camelot, right? It's like Camelot and Egypt, like not real places. And

29:06.640 --> 29:16.640
Brigadoon. Fuck this guy. Xanadu just coming down on Egypt. Xanadu has me. Hey, which side

29:16.640 --> 29:24.320
assaulted my sweet, sweet precious boy, Anderson Cooper? The pro Warwick guys. Yeah. Oh, you

29:24.320 --> 29:29.120
motherfuckers. Yeah. Fuck you guys. Punched him. Punched him right in the face. I have no interest.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.240
I'm not going to, I'm not going to squash the beef with those gentlemen. I'm going to frame

29:32.240 --> 29:37.360
broil that shit. Oh, you gotta turn it up. I'm going to turn up the heat. I'm so hungry right

29:37.360 --> 29:43.200
now. Yeah. I'm getting really hungry for beef. I really want some beef. I would love some beef.

29:43.200 --> 29:48.160
Let's see what some of the Yahoo answers user. Let's see how they explained the Egypt. I bet

29:48.160 --> 29:57.600
they're going to be boring. Svetlana says protesters gone loco. You guys, you guys are so crazy. They

29:57.600 --> 30:03.120
got like four red bulls in them and just went balls crazy. Their leader dude wants to take

30:03.120 --> 30:09.600
away everyone's rights. They need those rights. People are mad because there is too much beef.

30:13.440 --> 30:17.360
Some chick read the book of the dead and now the mummy is back and everyone is freaking out. He

30:17.360 --> 30:20.880
hasn't got all his organs yet, but he's not at full strength. So we will have some time before

30:20.880 --> 30:28.800
the apocalypse. Username Travis McElroy. Isaiah 19 one through four. Is there somebody predicting

30:28.800 --> 30:34.000
the end of the world? It's like the sign of the apocalypse or something. Oh, good. That's good.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.160
That's like the lamest sign of the apocalypse. Some people won't like their leader. Travis,

30:40.160 --> 30:44.320
what was the last thing you did before the world ended? I said something kind of racist.

30:44.320 --> 30:50.000
Can I still get into heaven? And Isaiah did come down from the mountain and said, hey,

30:50.560 --> 30:57.040
guys, this beef, you gotta end it. Squash it. Squash this beef. This is probably the shortest

30:57.040 --> 31:06.320
question we've ever had. Urinal etiquette? Steve, don't use them. I'm on the side of yes. I believe

31:06.320 --> 31:14.000
in it. I support it. I'm saying don't use them. Okay. Why? Don't use not don't use etiquette.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.960
Don't just don't use urinals. Why? Because you can go pee pee in the toilet and like

31:18.960 --> 31:25.600
there's a totally secure and safe environment for you to evacuate. If there is anyone at the urinals,

31:25.600 --> 31:32.080
though, and you decide to not use a urinal and to go use the toilet, I think it's important to tell

31:32.080 --> 31:37.040
them I'm going to go pee pee in the toilet because otherwise they're going to think that you're

31:37.040 --> 31:41.680
rude and just don't want to urinate next to them. I've got an ATB warning. I would announce I would

31:41.680 --> 31:46.800
announce loudly, like, don't take it personally. I just think you might look at my dick and go into

31:46.800 --> 31:52.320
the stall. Don't you look at my wiener. I know I look like a guy with a sweet, sweet dick and

31:52.320 --> 32:00.000
people want to like people want to find out. But if there's a trough there, a peeing trough. Oh,

32:00.000 --> 32:05.120
fuck that noise. You need to never go to that location ever again. You owe it to your community

32:05.120 --> 32:10.880
to grab it, pull it off the wall and say, this is for cows and then tear it off the wall because

32:10.880 --> 32:16.320
you're a human being. You're going to pee in a hole, not like in a because you're peeing with

32:16.320 --> 32:20.640
other dudes. You are basically peeing on each other, like taking turns, like standing in a

32:20.640 --> 32:24.960
circle, just peeing on each other. You're basically crossing swords like you're crossing pee streams

32:24.960 --> 32:30.480
like Ghostbusters. You don't even have that thin, like narrow wall of ceramic to like hide your

32:30.480 --> 32:36.160
shame. That's just low enough so that you can make eye contact. I love those. I love it when the

32:36.160 --> 32:41.040
troughs have ice in them. Like, cool, cool. This is a terrible, terrible middle of it. It's like I

32:41.040 --> 32:45.120
love the steam. I love the steam and I love the steam rising up from everybody else. And I'm

32:45.120 --> 32:50.640
fucking breathing in like I'm working at some sort of like sewage plant. This is an ideal bathroom

32:50.640 --> 32:55.200
experience for me. I really enjoy this. It doesn't. Oh, it doesn't flush. There's just a constant

32:55.200 --> 33:00.720
stream of like the filth just running over my icy piss and everyone else's icy piss.

33:00.720 --> 33:05.200
If you need me, I'll be in the bathroom. I'm going to be in the stall.

33:05.920 --> 33:16.240
You know what I like to do? What's that? A firm, wide stance and then one arm on the wall over the

33:16.240 --> 33:22.400
urinal. And I like to lean in as close as I can get. Like I'm laying on the urinal. That's very

33:22.400 --> 33:27.920
sanitary, too, because then you get like the urinal outline of piss water that is bounced

33:27.920 --> 33:32.400
off and refracted. Yeah, that's great. But then there's a vocal part with it, too,

33:32.400 --> 33:37.440
where I just keep muttering. Oh, not again. As long as we're talking about. No, no, no.

33:38.160 --> 33:42.240
As long as we're talking etiquette. Let's let's mention some of the top things that you shouldn't

33:42.240 --> 33:46.640
say when you're at the urinal. Griffin, what's the first thing you shouldn't say?

33:50.160 --> 33:55.040
Anything. Okay. Griffin says silence. Travis. Can I get your opinion on something?

33:55.040 --> 34:02.400
Oh, that's good. Not again is a popular one for me. I like to. And like in a dreading way, like

34:03.040 --> 34:13.360
not again. Oops. You know what I like? Oh, boy. Because then it makes the person feel like you're

34:13.360 --> 34:17.440
a celeb. Like maybe Dr. Sam Beckett just left in the urinal next to him. Yeah.

34:17.440 --> 34:26.080
And how about didn't I used to have two of those or or loudly? I'm masturbating.

34:27.840 --> 34:33.280
That's very on the nose. It's a little it's not like a clever. It's more just a direct.

34:33.280 --> 34:40.240
Hey, hey, Pete, get out of my wiener. What are you doing in there? You don't belong in there.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.800
Let's give you back to Earth. I've taken enough moisture from the Earth. I'll give you back.

34:44.800 --> 34:52.880
Griffin. Yeah. It's February. Oh, man. I have such a treat for everybody. Last month,

34:53.840 --> 35:00.640
we saved the fucking world. Right. Or at least like five or six people who would have died

35:00.640 --> 35:07.920
without our sagacious PSA's that we delivered on the subject of National Bath Safety Month.

35:08.560 --> 35:12.640
I feel like we help some people. I feel like we taught them a little bit about

35:12.640 --> 35:19.600
temperatures, appropriate temperatures, and Jesus' love. And now I think it's time that we do the

35:19.600 --> 35:27.920
same for February. Obviously, February is Black History Month, which we aren't going to joke

35:27.920 --> 35:37.760
about because that's a good month. That's a good thing. But about.com has a list of some other

35:37.760 --> 35:43.360
some other important topics that we need to address this this second most of months.

35:44.160 --> 35:49.520
And I think that what we should do is just go down the line and I'll read what month it is.

35:50.320 --> 35:55.600
And then if any of us had just something like jumps to heart, we can just say it and share

35:55.600 --> 36:03.440
some wisdom about the topic at hand. OK. Does that sound OK? We're kind of doing like a we'll

36:03.440 --> 36:08.000
be doing like a scattershot approach, but I feel like it's more important. Yeah, there's something

36:08.000 --> 36:12.400
we can help with. I don't want to leave it out. Yeah. So let's just touch a little bit on everything.

36:12.400 --> 36:19.760
OK. Adopt a rescued rabbit month. Do that.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.760
All right, so not that one, that one did not so much.

36:27.760 --> 36:33.520
What's this we're going to miss? Let's try again. OK. Bake for family fun month.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.800
Hey, so you're trying to stop drinking. Maybe try this instead.

36:38.000 --> 36:43.760
Do something with your kids for once. Stop drinking and bake, but don't drink. But do bake

36:44.480 --> 36:49.760
for fun. Have you noticed how your fatty kids are real bored? Think for family fun, fatty.

36:52.080 --> 36:56.240
You know what will fix the gap between you and your teenage son is it can't be healed by

36:56.240 --> 37:02.640
any amount of talking or pleading. Maybe some brownies baked together. The dough isn't the

37:02.640 --> 37:11.040
only thing that rises. Love does too. There's also love rising. Berry Fresh in the Sunshine

37:11.040 --> 37:20.560
State Month. What? Say again. Berry Fresh in the Sunshine State Month. Hi. Listen,

37:20.560 --> 37:24.640
when you open your door in Florida and you see a man outside named Berry Fresh.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.200
I was in the same place.

37:27.200 --> 37:32.560
He's on the run for the lamb from the law. He's on the lamb from the law. And you should open

37:32.560 --> 37:35.840
your home to him and make him a nice home cooked meal with your family baking.

37:37.040 --> 37:41.520
Hey, which of you Floridians brought these rotten ass berries up in here?

37:41.520 --> 37:45.680
Was it you, Dante? My brother, my brother and me.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.240
Dante, please keep your granny berries to yourself.

37:48.240 --> 37:55.200
Hey, Florida, Dante, no good. Sincerely Berry Fresh.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.920
Creative Romance Month.

38:01.920 --> 38:07.120
Hey, let's try the butt tonight. My brother, my brother and me. My brother, my brother and me.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.480
Tonight, we'll try the butt.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.600
Where's it going? Nobody knows.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.080
I do. My brother, my brother and me.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.400
Taking all comers. My brother, my brother and me.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.040
Hey, Festival of Camellias Month.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.320
What? Say it again.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.400
Festival of Camellias.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.000
What's a camellia?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.600
It's a, I think it's like a flower.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.560
These are beautiful. What are they? No one knows. My brother, my brother and me.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.120
I still party about these so much flowers I've never heard of.

38:36.240 --> 38:41.600
I can't express my love for camellias in one day or one week. I need 30 days or 40 days.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.960
30 whole goddamn days.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.920
Great American Pies Month.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.960
Keep your weak foreign pies to yourself. My brother, my brother and me.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.040
Goddamn. My brother, my brother and me.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.720
Shove your French pie up your butt.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.400
Marijuana Awareness Month? Isn't that every month?

39:02.400 --> 39:03.280
Have you heard of pot?

39:05.520 --> 39:07.120
National Bird Feeding Month.

39:07.920 --> 39:11.520
Hey, chip, chip, chip. Hey, come here. Chip, chip, chip.

39:11.520 --> 39:16.640
If you want the kind of birds surrounding your house that are weak and can't fend for themselves,

39:16.640 --> 39:18.880
by all means, my brother, my brother and me.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.080
National Care About Your Indoor Air Month.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.040
National Care About Your Indoor Air Month?

39:25.680 --> 39:26.800
Oh man, it's stuffy.

39:28.960 --> 39:35.520
I wish that I had 31 whole days to just like ponder that shit.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.560
You do, because it's National Care About Your Indoor Air Month.

39:38.560 --> 39:43.200
Hey, Jerry, give a shit for once in your life.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.480
Your air is stuffy and you can do something about it.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.560
National Care About Your Indoor Air Month.

39:50.560 --> 39:55.840
Open a door and then jerk off for 29 days, 23 hours and 38 minutes.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.880
My brother, my brother and me.

39:59.040 --> 40:02.400
Just air it out. Your apartment smells bad.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.120
It's like a colostomy bag in here. Let me out.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.760
National Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Awareness Month.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.720
Hey, do you need a doctor to tell you you're boring?

40:10.720 --> 40:12.560
By all means, my brother, my brother and me.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.560
Hey, enjoy your nap.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.680
My brother, my brother and me.

40:17.760 --> 40:18.880
My brother, my brother and me.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.040
I brought you your slippers.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.200
I'm tired of smoking chronic.

40:26.960 --> 40:27.600
No more.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.480
I'm trying to be aware of pot, but I'm also tired of smoking chronic.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.960
Because it's smelling up my indoor air.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.600
And this is not creative romance, if you think about it.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.760
Do you want to bake something with your family?

40:39.760 --> 40:41.280
No? Too tired?

40:41.280 --> 40:41.920
Me too.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.880
Do you want to invite Barry Fresh over?

40:46.400 --> 40:48.560
He'll make us some pot brownies with your family.

40:49.440 --> 40:50.720
National Condom Month.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.560
Bullshit.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.760
National- Holy shit.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.200
National Get to Know an Independent Real Estate Broker Month.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.320
I'm independent real estate broker Barry Fresh.

41:04.320 --> 41:08.080
I'd like to sell you some property.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.160
I have literally zero friends.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.520
We can hang out.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.120
Can we bake something together?

41:15.120 --> 41:18.800
Do you think that independent real estate agents know that?

41:18.800 --> 41:21.920
Know that this is their month and now they're just like waiting by the phone?

41:21.920 --> 41:23.360
Like, who's going to call me first?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.480
Oh, here it comes.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.280
Surely today.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.480
National Bend a Broken Heart Month.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.920
Hi, my name's Griffin McElroy.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.800
I- the joke's played.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.800
Yeah, I don't mind it.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.000
I think it still has some legs.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.600
Here's my question about all of these things.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.560
Oh, there's so many more.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.240
I don't think there are.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.600
National Senior Independence Month.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.440
You got this.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.720
You got this peoples.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.440
Hey, have you seen my peephole?

41:57.440 --> 41:58.720
He was supposed to be here.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.680
He said he was busting out.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.960
I set him free.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.320
I set him free.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.920
I opened the little clamp on the plastic gate and he's gone.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.280
He's out.

42:07.920 --> 42:08.880
He went to National-

42:08.880 --> 42:11.520
He said he was going to meet Barry Fresh and smoke some chronic

42:11.520 --> 42:14.160
and he wanted me to be aware of that, which I thought was weird.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.320
National Sweet Potato Month.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.280
Pretty cool, I guess.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.960
Yeah, it's like a good- it's pretty good.

42:21.760 --> 42:25.600
I would maybe pick the only fucking month where people eat sweet potatoes, but whatever.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.560
It's also North Carolina Sweet Potato Month.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.600
Hey, North Carolina, why don't you get off our backs?

42:33.600 --> 42:38.240
Like, we don't care about your region-specific vegetables.

42:38.240 --> 42:38.800
Like-

42:38.800 --> 42:43.440
Hey, have you tried- have you tried a North Carolina sweet potato?

42:43.440 --> 42:44.480
No, it sounds good.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.400
It shouldn't- it's a dirty sex act.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.720
Creatively romantic, but still dirty.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.800
You can only do it if you're in the Cirque du Soleil.

42:53.360 --> 42:56.160
It's a lot of- a lot of body training.

42:56.160 --> 42:56.400
Yeah.

42:57.440 --> 43:00.080
Return shopping carts to the supermarket month.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.080
Fuck you, Griffin, you're making these up.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.000
I'm not.

43:04.000 --> 43:04.880
Can I tell you something?

43:05.760 --> 43:06.880
This is not a joke.

43:06.880 --> 43:07.280
Okay.

43:07.280 --> 43:12.720
If you empty out your shopping cart and you don't take it back to the- to the- to the

43:12.720 --> 43:15.760
corral, you literally should be shot on sight.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.120
That's not an exaggeration.

43:17.120 --> 43:21.120
If you just leave it there in- in the parking spot, I- I'm not joking.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.280
This is not Justin, the character I play on My Brother, My Brother Made.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.840
This is Justin, the person who is on a podcast.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.640
That's- seriously, I wish you would be killed.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.000
I think you should be summarily executed.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.440
I'm going to throw an addendum on there.

43:33.440 --> 43:38.480
If you push the cart right up to like the back or the side of the cart corral, but you

43:38.480 --> 43:44.240
can't manage to put it back into the cart corral, what the fuck are you doing with your

43:44.240 --> 43:48.720
day that you are too busy to spend 10 seconds to wheel it into the cart corral?

43:48.720 --> 43:50.960
It's there so that I don't have to hit it with my car.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.800
And also, people from other parts of the country, we call them buggies.

43:54.800 --> 43:55.600
Get over it.

43:56.160 --> 43:56.640
Yeah.

43:56.640 --> 43:57.040
Awareness.

43:57.040 --> 44:00.560
You know who's- you know who's really bad about not returning their shopping carts to

44:00.560 --> 44:01.840
the- to the dock?

44:01.840 --> 44:02.480
Very fresh.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.120
Spunky Old Broads Month.

44:05.120 --> 44:05.520
Fuck you.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.960
Seriously, Griffin, delete your computer right now.

44:08.960 --> 44:09.840
Get that off of there.

44:09.840 --> 44:13.200
You can't read anywhere these Spunky Old Broads Month.

44:13.200 --> 44:17.680
But whatever you do, don't search Spunky Old Broads on your computer.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.200
For the love of Christ.

44:19.200 --> 44:19.360
No.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.040
I would do that, but I'm too busy celebrating worldwide renaissance of the heart month.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
I'm literally going to disconnect.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.480
My heart is back.

44:28.480 --> 44:33.680
I was gone for so many months, but now, much like the sweet potato, it has returned with

44:33.680 --> 44:34.240
full vigor.

44:35.840 --> 44:40.960
On a random whim, I joined a free online dating site and started getting messages from other

44:40.960 --> 44:41.360
members.

44:41.920 --> 44:46.000
Late one evening, I was messaging this guy and he asked me for my cell number.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.640
For some stupid reason, I gave it to him and now he won't stop texting me.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.480
I don't want to be mean and tell him to go away because I'm Canadian.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.440
We just don't do that.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.160
But I also don't want to keep texting him and lead him on.

44:58.160 --> 44:58.800
What should I do?

44:58.800 --> 44:59.600
I need answers.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.080
Sincerely, Confusing Canada.

45:03.440 --> 45:07.120
Hey, Confusing Canada, you brought this on yourself.

45:07.120 --> 45:11.280
Like, I can't help you out here and not be confident that you won't get right back into

45:11.280 --> 45:12.560
another similar situation.

45:13.920 --> 45:14.880
I need you to show me something.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.320
You're gonna have to learn a lesson.

45:16.320 --> 45:19.520
You gotta learn your lesson to just talk to this guy for a few months.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.200
Or change your cell phone number.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.640
Or just change it.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.280
You could probably block him in, like, a nice way, right?

45:25.280 --> 45:28.080
Isn't there, like, a nice, nice blocking option?

45:29.040 --> 45:31.520
This sounds to me like if someone wrote in and said,

45:31.520 --> 45:36.000
hey, I was going to make a cake and I added a bunch of disgusting ingredients and then

45:36.000 --> 45:38.880
was surprised when the thing I made was disgusting.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.880
Please come help me eat at my brother and my brother and me.

45:40.880 --> 45:41.760
No, we're not gonna help you.

45:41.760 --> 45:47.920
If you look at all of the, like, components of this, you joined a free online dating site.

45:47.920 --> 45:52.560
You started getting messages from a random guy and you gave him your cell phone number.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.880
You done goofed on, like, five or six different ones.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.800
What did you think was gonna happen?

45:56.800 --> 45:58.000
We're not being particularly helpful.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.680
Is there anything we can do for this person?

45:59.680 --> 46:01.280
Is there anything we can do at this point?

46:02.560 --> 46:05.520
If you haven't met him yet, you could reveal to him that you're really a guy.

46:06.160 --> 46:06.960
Ooh.

46:06.960 --> 46:07.680
That's good.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.040
That's good.

46:09.040 --> 46:15.040
Have him call you and have a burly dude answer the phone and say,

46:15.040 --> 46:17.200
if you don't stop calling Debra, you're dead.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.320
And then hang up.

46:18.320 --> 46:18.640
Yeah.

46:18.640 --> 46:22.160
Yeah, cause that, that would get them, he would get the message.

46:22.160 --> 46:23.280
Like, he would get it.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.040
I don't know that there, there's anybody with that voice that lives in Canada.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.040
You would probably have to shop that one out.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.640
Just stop calling Debra, eh?

46:33.440 --> 46:34.240
Oh, that's good.

46:34.240 --> 46:39.760
This is comedian Dave Thomas, and I'd like you to stop calling Debra, eh?

46:40.720 --> 46:45.280
Debra has contracted me to send you this friendly message, hoser.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.160
How about, how about four Yahoo answers in a row?

46:48.160 --> 46:48.720
Okay.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.120
This one was sent in by John Peter Grant.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.640
Thanks, JPG.

46:52.640 --> 46:56.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ginny Day, who asks, sexy nightclub name, please.

46:57.360 --> 47:01.760
Sexy, sophisticated, not too gothy, not too emo, not too strip clubby.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.440
I need a good name for a club like this.

47:04.160 --> 47:04.800
Justin, go.

47:06.800 --> 47:09.840
What about sophistication, but with a lot of wrong letters?

47:10.640 --> 47:12.000
Can you give me an example?

47:12.000 --> 47:15.040
Like S O F O.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.480
Okay.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.080
I S T.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.520
Like fist?

47:19.520 --> 47:20.800
That part is capitalized.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.200
Okay.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.280
S O F I S T capitalized.

47:26.160 --> 47:26.640
Haitian.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.800
Like, spelled like Haitian.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.680
Sophist Haitian?

47:32.320 --> 47:33.200
Hold on, hold on.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.240
I forgot about that.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.120
Sophistic Haitian.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.240
Let's workshop this.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.920
I think I, the wheels came off somewhere.

47:41.200 --> 47:44.320
Let's send that one right back, right back to the romper room.

47:44.320 --> 47:48.480
If it's a gay strip club, the best name you can give it is shamanigans, but-

47:48.480 --> 47:52.080
Right, but that's, we've shared that magic with everybody.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.720
This is not, this is a, this is a sexy nightclub.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.640
Okay, give me some, give me some of the buzzwords.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.000
What's this nightclub about again?

47:58.960 --> 48:03.680
Sexy, sophisticated, not too gothy, not too emo, not too strip clubby.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.000
Like-

48:04.000 --> 48:05.920
I think that's a great name for a bar.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
A little birdy, but sure.

48:07.920 --> 48:13.200
Yahoo Answers user Kush Candy, fuck, said,

48:13.200 --> 48:15.360
I thought about the ideas of starting a nightclub.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.960
I thought of names if I owned a posh nightclub, and even if I owned a grungy bar.

48:19.600 --> 48:26.080
If I owned a grungy bar, I'd call it hammered, lol, or hammer, apostrophe D.

48:26.880 --> 48:27.360
Okay.

48:27.360 --> 48:27.760
What?

48:27.760 --> 48:31.840
If I owned a sexy, sophisticated nightclub like you're describing,

48:31.840 --> 48:38.320
I thought of the name, number four, capital N, but the N would look a lot fancier.

48:38.320 --> 48:46.080
Why four N or four N? Because it is foreign, and foreign is just sexy, lol.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.360
Fuck you.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.320
You could die in a car crash.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.800
What? Foreign is sexy.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.960
I have, I have a good name, effervesse.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.160
What do you think of that?

48:56.160 --> 48:56.960
I like that.

48:56.960 --> 48:57.520
You like that?

48:57.520 --> 48:57.840
That's a good one.

48:57.840 --> 48:58.320
Effervesse.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.680
Um, what's the name of the nightclub that opened in Huntington, West Virginia,

49:03.680 --> 49:09.760
that had the absolute best name ever on 4th Avenue? It was, uh-

49:09.760 --> 49:11.680
Stumblers 2, Still Stumblin'?

49:11.680 --> 49:13.360
That's not a thing. Uh, it was-

49:13.360 --> 49:14.480
Yes, that is a thing.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.840
Griffin, that's 100% a thing.

49:16.480 --> 49:17.280
Is it really called Still Stumblin'?

49:17.280 --> 49:21.040
Stumblers 2, Still Stumblin'. It's a BART sequel.

49:21.040 --> 49:25.120
Oh, god. Is Billy Crystal in it all the time?

49:25.120 --> 49:26.560
Yeah.

49:26.560 --> 49:27.760
All the time, Billy Crystal?

49:28.800 --> 49:32.480
Uh, no, I was thinking of Club Babylon, City of Sin.

49:32.480 --> 49:32.720
Yeah.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.280
Oh, there it is.

49:33.280 --> 49:37.200
Now they got Stumblers 3, The Legend of Curly's Gold.

49:37.200 --> 49:37.440
Yeah.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.200
Which is pretty good.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.360
Yahoo! NTS user Dman says,

49:41.360 --> 49:42.560
Nightclub of Sex.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.160
Hookup Hanger.

49:47.920 --> 49:48.960
Party Sex Fun.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.160
Building of Pleasure.

49:54.160 --> 49:56.800
Jesus Christ, how about the Ball Room?

49:57.680 --> 50:00.000
What's that sound? It's the room to go into ball.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.720
The Hall of Genitalia.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.720
Gucci Gulch.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.200
Gucci Gulch.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.320
I love it.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.040
Yahoo! NTS user-

50:11.040 --> 50:12.400
How about the Stink Room?

50:15.680 --> 50:17.680
Welcome to the Stink Room.

50:17.680 --> 50:21.680
Can I take your coat or your colostomy bag?

50:22.400 --> 50:24.160
Yahoo! NTS user Liz says,

50:24.720 --> 50:25.200
Pure.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.040
Synergy.

50:28.160 --> 50:28.640
Silk.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.320
Cream.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.160
Nebula.

50:33.760 --> 50:38.240
Okay, the name of my club is Pure Silk Cream Synergy Nebula.

50:40.240 --> 50:40.720
Welcome.

50:41.600 --> 50:43.920
Welcome to PSNPN.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.840
I actually really like the name Creamy Nebula.

50:47.840 --> 50:48.800
I'd go there.

50:48.800 --> 50:49.920
Come implode with us.

50:51.520 --> 50:56.080
We have a special on all our drinks for the Creative Romance Month celebrations.

50:56.080 --> 51:01.200
With Artisan Bartender Berry Fresh.

51:02.960 --> 51:05.040
Come on, let me mix you up a cocktail.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.400
Ooh, what about cocktail?

51:08.320 --> 51:11.440
Cocktail is a pretty good name for this bar.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.080
Are we gonna even mess with hyphenations?

51:14.080 --> 51:16.080
No, no hyphenations.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.200
Hyphenations is a good one.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.240
That's for grungy bars.

51:18.960 --> 51:19.680
Hyphenations.

51:19.680 --> 51:26.000
H-Y-F-E-N-A-S-H-U-N-Z.

51:27.440 --> 51:28.000
Would you go?

51:29.120 --> 51:29.760
Question mark.

51:30.720 --> 51:31.680
Hyphenations?

51:31.680 --> 51:32.960
It's up in the air.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.800
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.400
I'm crushed right now.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.120
Why?

51:37.120 --> 51:39.040
Just this whole, just this episode.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.800
We've seen a lot of spite.

51:40.800 --> 51:42.800
It's like a dark side of humanity, right?

51:42.800 --> 51:46.800
Like a lot of bad, there's a lot of bad stuff out there, guys.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.920
More than ever, you need to cling to each other and love each other.

51:49.920 --> 51:55.040
I know it's a week before Valentine's Day, but tell the person who means the most to you

51:55.760 --> 51:57.520
that they mean something to you.

51:57.520 --> 52:02.400
Because if you look at the internet and you look at the beefs all across the world,

52:03.200 --> 52:04.480
people are beefing right now.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.200
It's like really beefy out there.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.240
It's really beefy.

52:08.240 --> 52:12.720
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but a few little housekeeping things.

52:12.720 --> 52:18.080
mbnbam.com is our website, you can go there and listen to old episodes.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.720
You can subscribe there.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.240
You can ask us a question there.

52:23.440 --> 52:24.640
There's tons of stuff you can do.

52:24.640 --> 52:30.800
If you want to talk with us, you can go to maximumfun.org and go to the forums there,

52:30.800 --> 52:32.880
and you'll find a thread about this new episode.

52:32.880 --> 52:35.360
You talk about it with us and all of your friends.

52:35.360 --> 52:43.200

52:43.200 --> 52:44.480
You can email us there.

52:44.480 --> 52:47.040

52:47.040 --> 52:50.880
It's $150 for corporate messages and $100 for private messages.

52:50.880 --> 52:53.760
You can email Teresa at maximumfun.org.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.440
That's with an H.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.440
That also links to a free jingle.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.920
Yeah, free custom-made jingle.

52:59.920 --> 53:00.800
Custom-made jingle.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.760
Just keep it and have it and use it and profit off it.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.200
Fold it into the price.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.760
We got a couple emails this week about listening parties.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.000
Good try.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.600
Let's explain how linear time works.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.240
Okay.

53:14.240 --> 53:19.040
If you email us and say, I just had a listening party, we can't help you with that one.

53:20.320 --> 53:23.200
We're not time wizards anymore.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.640
We are time mermaids.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.880
So if you are going to have one, let us know.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.000
What's the protocol?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.400
Let's do a checklist that people can just go down.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.920
Okay, are you having a party?

53:35.040 --> 53:35.600
Yes.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.560
How many people are going?

53:37.680 --> 53:38.560
Over four?

53:38.560 --> 53:39.280
Great.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.080
Four or more.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.120
Four or more.

53:41.120 --> 53:41.620
Perfect.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.880
Is it before the party?

53:45.440 --> 53:45.940
Yes.

53:46.480 --> 53:51.040
So email mbmbam at gmail.com or at maximumfun.org, either way.

53:52.720 --> 53:55.120
Make sure to put listening party in the subject line.

53:55.120 --> 53:59.680
Let us know who's going to be there, when's it going on, what are you eating, all that stuff.

53:59.680 --> 54:07.680
And we'll send you back an mp3 that personally greets your party and lets you kick it off in a very personal way.

54:07.680 --> 54:12.320
And it's not a requirement, but I would prefer if the parties were black tie formal.

54:12.320 --> 54:13.360
Yes, super formal.

54:13.360 --> 54:19.920
And make sure you send us a picture afterwards, so we know how it went down, that it went down.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.080
I don't understand what the confusion was.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.400
I don't know where this got mixed up.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.720
Were our policies, were they not?

54:26.720 --> 54:32.560
I don't know if it's our policies or if just people don't understand cause and effect.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.880
I'm not angry at you.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.480
I'm just worried.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.240
I'm just worried about you guys.

54:38.240 --> 54:43.840
Any other things we need to talk about super duper quick before we head out into the sunset?

54:43.840 --> 54:53.040
I know it's been a couple weeks now, but if you haven't yet, take this opportunity to go check out the other wonderful podcasts on maximumfun.org.

54:53.040 --> 54:59.760
Yeah, Dutch John and Hollisman, they just wrapped up The Impostors, but there's a hundred episodes of that you can go listen to.

54:59.760 --> 55:04.560
Our friends, our buddies, stop podcasting yourself, all that stuff.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.520
Are we bros now?

55:05.520 --> 55:07.840
We are pretty much bros for life.

55:07.840 --> 55:10.640
Listen, seven days and we squash that fucking beef.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.520
Hey Egypt.

55:11.520 --> 55:12.400
Hey Egypt.

55:12.400 --> 55:13.200
Get on it.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.920
I'm tired of hearing about it, Egypt, wrap it up.

55:15.920 --> 55:19.840
Griffin, hit me with the last question, the one that I've been waiting for.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.840
It's the worst thing ever.

55:21.840 --> 55:22.480
Okay.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.160
It'll poison our minds.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.200
Sounds great.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.680
Sent in by Justin Russo.

55:27.680 --> 55:28.480
Thank you, Justin.

55:28.480 --> 55:44.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tori Hamel, who asks, why, if I read it so maybe it'll be less terrible, does my vagina smell like Doritos?

55:44.240 --> 56:02.000
I couldn't, thanks for listening, we had a good 41 episode run, but I fucking, I can't do it anymore.

56:02.000 --> 56:07.440
We had some laughs, some good times, we're quitting the show, we're forever.

56:07.440 --> 56:14.240
It's magical, what happened to my brother, my brother, me, and Curtis, because what happens in that show needs to be on.

56:14.240 --> 56:15.040
Fuck you.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.400
I'm Justin McElroy.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.600
I'm Travis McElroy.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

56:18.880 --> 56:23.200
And this was my brother, my brother, me, and it's over.

56:23.200 --> 56:35.440
Kiss your dad, and something, something, it's over, it's done, we're done with the show, brother, and ever, just forever.

56:35.440 --> 56:48.800
Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, hey, keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart, play your part.
