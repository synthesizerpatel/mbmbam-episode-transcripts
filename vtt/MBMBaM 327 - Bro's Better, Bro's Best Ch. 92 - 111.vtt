00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
If I do my very best, I'm an angel

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
That's it, step one, talk like Bill Clinton

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Maybe a fellatio goof

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
My fellow Americans, blow jobs

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Is that good? Is that a good impression?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
You are gonna call that number

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
You will call that number and it will not be accidental, it will be drunk

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, it'll maybe be a year from now

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
When you're real sad and lonely on Valentine's Day and you just call her at night and you go, hey, hey Debra

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
We haven't spoken in about a year

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I thought we had something special together

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh man, the whole episode, huh?

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
This is former president Bill Clinton

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm a ghost now, now I'm a ghost who loves blow jobs

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
I love blow jobs, balanced budgets and hauntings

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Griffin, yours sounds more like Don Nott's

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
The secret to Bill Clinton is you gotta sound like a ghost underneath a bunch of blankets

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
That's the secret

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I love Bill Clinton

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
And if you felt a little undertaker in there

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh yes, it's me, former president Bill Clinton

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Blow jobs

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
We're like milk, we're zero scoops

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
We actually cool other people's love when they drink us

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Just to be in our presence kills other people's love

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah, we're the opposite of love, whatever that is

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
They need to come up with an opposite of love

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
How about it, wordsmiths?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Happy love

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Even with all your science, you still haven't been able to come up with a word that's the opposite of love

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, it's pretty despicable

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
You know, you think about Shakespeare

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Shakespeare created eyeball, he created the word puking

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Green-eyed monster

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Skim milk, obscene

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Luggage

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
That's all created by Shakespeare

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
He couldn't come up with the opposite of love

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Pinterest?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
He did not

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
He did, he was talking about someone, I think it was in Two Gentlemen of Verona

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Where he says, her practicing her sartorial craft

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
She had a lot of Pinterest because she had a lot of interest in pins

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
And then the other gentleman of Verona responds

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
It's not that she loved her, he opposite of loved her

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
He did, he didn't

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Then he vomits and blacks out for six hours

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's his longest play

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
As a result

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
In lots of theaters they cut that, they trim it down to three hours of vomiting and blacking out

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Well you can usually just turn it into a dream ballet

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That kind of conveys the time

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Or you do a War of the Roses kind of thing

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
You're like, hey buckle in audience

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah, purists do the whole thing

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
This is a three hour song about social networking platforms

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
I am Barbacane the Tumbler

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Lord Steven of LiveJournal

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I don't know what's happening

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
I would like to have been there on this day when this girlfriend asked this guy how much he loved her

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And he responded, I don't know

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I have to go to Yahoo Answers

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
A hundred?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I literally can't quantify it

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
How big is a house?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
We have an opportunity here, not to equate it to another metric

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
But to come up with our own metric

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
That we can think about how much money we can make off of that

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
If we sold that shit to Hallmark and we just said like 50 billion

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Throbs

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Throbs is so good

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm mad that we were going to have this whole riff and Travis just nailed it right out of the gate

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
It's throbs, obviously

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
It's sexual, but it's also heart related

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay, so zero throbs is just utter indifference

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And negative throbs is that hatred or does hatred have its own

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Now what is hatred?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm sorry, I forgot the goof

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Hahahaha

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm not even going to do your throb goof now because you ruined my goof

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Please don't take this out on the money making opportunity that we have in front of us

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Once a season I get a goof veto

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And I'm using it to veto this goof as a punishment

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
For you unintentionally killing my goof

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
This is like a goof end of Reservoir Dogs

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
Hahahaha

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Travis is cutting a goof ear off

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Just dancing

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Fuck

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Say your dumb thing about the throbs

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
My internal critic is Rupert Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
And whenever I have no matter what entertainment or media I'm taking in

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
He's always disappointed in me

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
That's not a goof

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I feel guilty all the time that I'm not reading books

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Hahahaha

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Sometimes for me it's Wanda, sometimes it's Maggie, sometimes they're together

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I would watch that buddy comedy all day long

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
They made it, it's called Taxi

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Hahahaha

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I don't have an internal critic

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Is that normal?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
You have a lot of external ones

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Hahahaha

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I get ballots

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
This one was sent in by Graham Wetterburn

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Thank you Graham

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
That's a good name Graham

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah it's by Yahoo Answers user Raj who asks

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Why does Dilbert's tie curve up?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Hahahaha

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Scott Adams said in an interview with groundreport.com

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
No one really knows, including me

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Dilbert started as a doodle before I knew he would be famous

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't remember what I was thinking the day I decided to curl his tie up

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
WikiAnswers' search tells me

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
A. It's a metaphor for his inability to control his environment

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
B. He's just glad to see you

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
But IMO. A mini hurricane surrounds him and keeps flapping his tie

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
To all Dilbert fans, what do you think?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Hahahaha

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Oh god

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Who thinks about Dilbert this much?

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Apparently not even Scott Adams can be troubled to figure out why his dumb tie is standing up

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
He's too busy hating women

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
When you ask the sexist creator of Dilbert

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Hey what's the deal with the tie?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
He's like fuck it I don't know

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Stop pursuing that line of questioning

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Why is his tie sticking up?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Cause she didn't cook it long enough

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Hahahaha

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
In the kitchen

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I'm Scott Adams

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Why is his tie sticking up?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Why are you not having kids?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Get out of my face

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Scott Adams

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Hold on, I really think this Scott Adams character is going somewhere

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Why don't you workshop it and come back

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Hahahaha

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Justin's going to go workshop his Scott Adams character for a couple minutes

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Travis and I are going to goof on the original cue

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
But Justin's going to go off

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Hahahaha

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You guys go forward and I will dip back in

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
In a little bit with some more Scott Adams

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Let me give you a setup

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
It's Scott Adams in a pet shop

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
That's run by a woman

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Good good

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
I also like the person who ever said number two

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
He's just happy to see you

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Dilber's just got himself a tie bow in there

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Nothing weird

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
He's got a tie-rection

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I think it's suggesting that Dilber is so bound to his job

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
That his tie has literally become a part of his body

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And when blood flow increases to the tie

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It forms a fully erect phallus

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And he has a really curvy wiener

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Just like a hook, like a fish hook wiener

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
It's just a half chub

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
If it was a full chub, his tie would be sticking straight out from his neck

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Why are these poodles so expensive?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Must be your time of the month

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, there he is

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Hey, Scott Adams, ladies and gentlemen

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Hey, what's next?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
What's our next scenario?

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
Scott Adams is an astronaut going to the moon with a female astronaut

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay, I'll check you out

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
This is the kind of question, right?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
That somebody doesn't just ask

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, they did ask it

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
No, but I'm saying this isn't like

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh, it just popped in my head

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
They've stared at Dilber every Sunday

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Here's a few excerpts from my thesis

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
My master's thesis

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
What's the deal with Dilber?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I mean, there are a couple of answers from people who say

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Adams is also hinted that the tie may just be displaying an aversion to him

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
We may never truly know why Dilber's tie does what it does

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Dilber's tie doesn't do shit

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's not a real thing

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
A dude draws it and he doesn't know why he does it that way

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
There's no deeper truth

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I just heard Justin inhale sharply

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Which makes me think he's ready to give us his

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Scott Adams goes to the moon goof

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Why are you even coming, Angela?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
The moon's made of green cheese, not malls

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm Scott Adams

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
The first opus was a little stronger

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
And he's also starting to mutate a little bit into the Wolfman

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Can I have one more?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, God

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I need to redeem myself

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Scott Adams is getting married

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Okay, got it

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
DiabloAnswersUser? responded to me

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I think that Dilber's tie curves up to give him some individuality

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
He works at one of those office settings where he is really just another number and paycheck

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Nobody's special

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
He can be replaced at any time and nobody would notice

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I think Dilber's tie makes him stand out

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Even though nobody really comments on it

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Hey, I think you're projecting a little bit, bro

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, maybe just a touch

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And maybe Dilber's there and Angela and accounting just doesn't want to talk to him

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Even though he's a super nice guy and he offered to make her dinner

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And that's why his tie curves up

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It's hard, man

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
He just gets repressed by his triangular boss

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And his dog talks

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Which is pretty cool

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
His dog talks and his cat is like an evil scientist

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I haven't read it in a while

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
But there's an intern or something

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
And they're real

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Do you remember we used to have that Dilber screensaver?

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah, the Dilber desktop games

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Man, when I was nine, that was a jam

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, we played some real dumb shit

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Hey Justin, you got that goof ready for us?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
For all that you are

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And all that you will be

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And all that we will be together

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I do

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
Want you to get in the kitchen and make me some hamburger helper

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I got it

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Shit

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Is this the first lie bowl we've ever done?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
If you guys could adopt one celebrity

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Who would it be?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Obviously, not Dilber Godfrey

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He's going to keep you rolling, right?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
With all the zingers

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But I don't think that

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
The rest of it would make up for it

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Ian McShane

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
What would Ian McShane be like, Travis?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Mostly he'd just shuffle around the house

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
In a bathrobe cursing

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Sounds pretty good

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Wouldn't that be awesome?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And just have friends over and be like

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Don't mind my Ian McShane

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Don't let him climb on your lap

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Ian, down

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Down

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I'm going to go with Giamatti

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Oh

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I imagine him hiding up in the corner of the ceiling

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And just spot him with a flashlight to get him down

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Don't look at him, it's a challenge

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Giamatti

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Do you know what the problem with having a pet Giamatti is?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
He's a Pokemon

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It's Giamatti

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Giamatti, go

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You're so skittish

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Go

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Giamatti is the human equivalent of a comically large rabbit, I feel like

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh crap

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Justin

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You got a celeb?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm not going to adopt a celebrity to make any goddamn sense

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
They're people, they live in houses

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
They are human beings

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I don't understand

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I don't understand the question

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
And as requested

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
As promised, I should say

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
We have got a jingle

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
That is

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Over a month in the making

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Don't fucking talk about that

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
And it's been something Griffin has been sort of working on in his spare time

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
In his off hours in the basement

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Five weeks

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
About 35 minutes of work on it

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Just hours of tinkering

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
He just wants

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Sometimes he'll say, can I hear it?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And he'll be like, he's not ready

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
It sounds tinny

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Bring up the speaker

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It's got hand claps

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It's got bass

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It's got kazoo noises

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's got layering

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It's going to be amazing

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Here it is

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Put your soap in my soap

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And we'll both get clean together

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Put your soap in my soap

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Put your soap in my soap

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
It's got a divot for your pleasure

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You gotta use that soap

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Don't you waste your soap away

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You gotta use that soap

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Buy yourself some bars today

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Yeah

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Don't let your skin get dry

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Stack soap, don't use no lye

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Stack your soap into the sky

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Buy yourself a little hope

15:23.000 --> 15:35.000
A little hope with Stack Soap

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Stack Soap

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Get yourself clean

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Buy yourself a part

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's where you'll find it

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
Get it on Kickstarter

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
It's going to smell so fresh

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Soap

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Wow

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I hope I win the Grammy this year

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
for best soap song

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Just to take things a little serious for a second

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
but not too serious because we'll come up the other end

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
The last time that we all went to Golden Corral

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
was the first Christmas Eve after our mother passed away

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
We decided that's the time we've got to get in there

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and gnaw on the beef hooks

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
That's going to turn us around

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
We were like, we'll go out to dinner for Christmas

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and didn't think of the fact that it's fucking Christmas

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
and everybody in their right mind is closed

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Everybody's closed so there's one place that's open

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Motherfucking Golden Corral

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Well don't worry guys because it was the closest restaurant

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
to the cemetery we had just visited

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Pretty good choice Golden Corral

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
How much does this restaurant cost to eat at?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Everything

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Do you want to know the saddest part?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
We weren't the only ones there

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It was full of people getting their holiday nosh on

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
None of them were quite as in good spirits as us

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Nobody made eye contact

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Nobody made eye contact

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
You could tell the holiday magic was there

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
because a boy would come up to the beef hook

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and a man would scoot over a little bit

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Come on Junior

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Come on

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Get on in here

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I've already gotten through the pre-gristle

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Really tuck into the meat

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
All those boys over there

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
They just made a terrible life choice

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
They probably could have made spaghetti at home or something

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Just slosh your sauce

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and count your blessings

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
If I go to Italy and talk with an Italian accent

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
would I offend the Italians?

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm going to Germany, Austria, and Italy May 23rd for 11 days

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I just wanted to ask

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I talk with an Italian accent but don't speak Italian

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Would the Italians find that offensive?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I can't imagine

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Why would they?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I think they'll find it flattering

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
They might think they're having a stroke

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Why do I understand?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't understand what you're saying

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But it's Italian, it's got to be

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's got to be Italian

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Look at you

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
He's an innovator

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
He's a pioneer of the Italian language

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't understand any of it

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
You douchebag

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
This you doucher

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
This is either like

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
You either are planning on doing this

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Which is bad

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Or you already speak with an Italian accent

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
But you don't speak Italian

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
And your name is Kevin

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
So you're not from Italy originally

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Do you know why people have accents?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Do you know how that happens?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Because they're from the place, Kevin

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Jesus, Kevin

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Kevin, you are from Nebraska

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You speak with a Nebraska accent

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
A Nebraska brogue

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I've never been to a foreign country

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
But I have to imagine

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That it would be the same

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
As if anyone from Italy

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Rolled up to America

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And was like, now I'm going to speak with an American accent

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Like

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I don't hope for that

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It wouldn't be a thing

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It would be like, como esta

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Mi amigo

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Donde esta

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
La biblioteca

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Donde esta la biblioteca

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Biblioteca

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Que tal

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Mi amigo

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I sound like the DNA strand

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah, you do

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Dinosaurs

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Mi amigo

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
De

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Ñe

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Es

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Es tu amigo

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Oh my

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
God

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Donde esta

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Thunder Lizard

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Bien con migo

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
A Jurassic Park

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Que es tu nombre

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Mi nombre es

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Jose Hammond

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Que es la problema

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Mi amigo

20:17.000 --> 20:29.000
Tassara Tops

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I wish I knew more Spanish

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
But I don't know any

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I know how to ask for the library

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Or maybe bookstore

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I know how to say bathroom

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And Mr. Ian Malcolm

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Oh

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Baby finds a wife

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Es verdad

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Christ

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah, oh god, don't do this

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
thing, Kevin

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I have recently embarked on a year long

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
personal crusade to shed a bunch

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
of extra LBs

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I've got a lot to lose, so I've broken it down

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
into 20 pound milestones, so I have goals

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
to plan against. And the first one is coming up

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
soon. In general

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I fit the heavy set ponytail, bearded

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
nerd stereotype, so recently had

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
the idea I should probably mix it up at each 20 pound

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
milestone. Cut my hair, shave

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
my beard, start dressing a little nicer

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Do you guys have any other ideas for potential

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
me changers, health

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
style or otherwise, that's trying

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
to rock it in Rochester

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
First of all, good on ya

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Yeah, I love this question

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
so much I could faint. Getting it in 20

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
does. 20 does

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
you were getting it

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I love the physical appearance

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
and caring about all that. Make sure that you're

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
taking care of your mental

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
self as well, so maybe on the next

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
milestone, you try

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
something, you know, food

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
or beverage related that you've never tried

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
before, something a little adventurous, and maybe you find

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
that you have a

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
great palette for wine, or

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
you really like Italian food, you know, something

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
new. Wait, hold the

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
fuck up, Travis. What are you

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
are you saying?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
To reward yourself on this quest

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
to lose weight, what you should get

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
into is wine and

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Italian food? Okay, let me strike

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
that. Oh yeah, I lost 60

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
pounds. Time to go to the OG and gain

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
it all back. What about

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
carb up and slurp down? I will have

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
all the fujule

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Let me see all the fujule that you

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
got on your shelf. Well, just let me introduce

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
myself. I'm fat again

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Then

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
can I say art?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Yes, not only

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
can you say art, you should have said art

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
the first time. I'm going to double back

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and say art. You can't.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
You can't. I can't. You guys

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
edit out your shit all the time.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
He's

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
right about that.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
He is not wrong. So let's say

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
rather than food and beverage, let's say culture

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
and maybe

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
go to a museum

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
or go to see a ballet

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
or go to see a symphony, something, you

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
know, that maybe you're not

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
normally into and you just want to check out and see

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
if maybe you dig it. You guys are thinking

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
so small scale.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I am

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
amazed at you. This guy

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
is offering us a chance. Every

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
20 pounds he loses, he can

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
totally and completely

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
reinvent his entire persona

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
so much so that

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
his friends won't recognize him.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
You lose 20 pounds, cut your

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
hair, shave your beard, wear

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
sunglasses constantly, and

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
say your name is now Roz.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Lose another 20 pounds,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
maybe you

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
go hit the tanning bed constantly

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
and you bleach your teeth

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
and then you change your name again to Brock.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Or the Brock.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Or the Mr. The Brock.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And then next time, you're going to

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
be really fit. Maybe get that asshole

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
bleached and let's see if we can't get a porn career

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
going. Lose 40 pounds, bleach that asshole,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
regain 20.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Where are you at now?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Your friends don't know which side they're coming

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
from. Lose 40 pounds of fat,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
regain 20 pounds of fuck

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
muscle. Get in there. What is

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
that?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It's what you

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
use to thrust. It's the

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
thrusters. It's your

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
thrusters. I just gotta get

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
your thrusters going and your afterburners.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I learned these.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm going to take you to hyperspace.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Try a barrel roll.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It's bad news.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Our shields are failing.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Girl, girl.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Fire up the tachyon cannons.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Oh man. I need some

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
more dilithium crystals, by which I mean

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
meth. Of course in that case

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
it would be fuck meth. Because it's the meth

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
that you use for sex.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I learned in school that

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
every muscle is a fuck muscle or you're just not

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
doing it right.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
What class was that in?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
What school were you going to?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Health school.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
You dummy.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I saw an episode of Morrie recently

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
where Morrie likes to cure people of their fears

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
by something Morrie believes in called immersion therapy.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Where he

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
is like, I know you're afraid of band-aids.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
We're covering you with band-aids.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Wake up. You've been covered with band-aids

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
this whole time. There was a lady

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
who was afraid. Her big

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
fear? Tigers.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
And Morrie brought a tiger.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That's a perfectly reasonable fear.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Can we all keep our fear of tigers?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Can we not be afraid

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
of tigers? That seems like a super

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
good one.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Deborah, just keep in mind that the tiger

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
is just as afraid of you as you

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
are of it. Oh, no. It wasn't.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Sorry, you're dead.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
They're acting like it's a problem

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
because I can't even look at

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Frosted Flakes. Don't get Frosted Flakes.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Don't go to Frosted Flakes.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Get the off-brand

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
toasted flakes.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And don't go to Exxon.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I think that's pretty much it, right?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Don't go to any Bengals games.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
My day-to-day exposure to

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
tigers is actually pretty low.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I don't have to see a

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
tiger if I don't want to. You know what?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Thinking about that, mine might be a little bit too low.

26:13.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm not sure I'm getting enough vitamin T.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Everybody's got some

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
needs, and

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
everybody's got some wants.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Extreme

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Restraints' catalog of sexual

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
products will fulfill both of those

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
things for you.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
So visit extremerestraints.com

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
and

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
get

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
an electroshock paddle that goes

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
on your balls.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Is that a real thing?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
It should be.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
going to request that you put a real product

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
in there.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Go to extremerestraints.com

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
and buy a ghost

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
that you can fuck every night.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That's

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
not a thing. We need a site

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
called Extreme Restraints.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Go to extremerestraints.com

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
and buy a sexual

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
fish tank.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
You're

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
doing an ad for

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
extremerestraints.com.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Go to extremerestraints.com

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and learn about all the good chicken

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Popeye recipes

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
on the forums.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Holy

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
inaccurate. Everything you're saying right

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
now is a bastardization of this product message.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
This is by Yahoo Answers

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
user marymaryx30

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
who asks,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
how do I improve my scorpions?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
My

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
scorpions are okay, but not the best.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
How do I improve them? I've been

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
struggling with them for months.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
That's it?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
That's so important. That's the context?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Best at what?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
By the way, when I said that it was related

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I meant completely

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
diametrically. Best in what

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
capacity? With scorpions

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
you have four basic

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
criteria for

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
judging their quality.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
It's their four danger zones, right?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Yeah, the four danger zones you've got to worry

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
about. One, exoskeleton.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Yes.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
What kind of chitin is he working

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
with? Can we improve it?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
How's your chitin? Is he getting enough vitamin D?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
That's huge for chitin.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
D is, I say, I've

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
always said that. What's that motto

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
you always tell people and you have it

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
cross-stitched up on the

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
hanging up there in the den above the fireplace?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
What is it?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
It's

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
you gotta have D

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
if you want

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
if you don't

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
don't shed your

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
don't shed

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
that chitin.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Fuck!

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It took

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
it took our mom weeks to stitch

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
exactly that, but Griffin

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
was very... And she was not a

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
swearing woman. Yeah, she did not

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
enjoy swearing, but Griffin was very

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
specific. So armor.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Armor, that's number one.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Second, of course, claws.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Does it look like a little

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
crab? Do I know if scorpions

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
have claws? How are the

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
pincers? How are the pincers?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Number three,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
obviously,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
pointy tail.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
What's in there?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Who knows? Caramel?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Poison?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I injected some caramel into all your treats.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I'm the best scorpion ever.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
And then what's the fourth

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
one? Heat coming off the genitals.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
How is its

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
genital heat? Also, can you find my

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
scorpion's genitals for me?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Can I make a 1980s movie called

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Genital Heat? I've been over this

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
motherfucker's thorax with a fine tooth comb.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
No genitals to be found.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
If you see a scorpion in your

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
house, your very

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
next stop is

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
an open house.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Century 21.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Pardon me.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
This is a lovely open

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
house. Thank you for having me. I'll take it.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I cannot sell my old

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
house because the scorpion lives there now.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
It's his now.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I'm gonna try to charge him taxes

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
on the sale, but

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I don't know how- scorpions don't have money.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Can we improve the

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
mass marketability of these scorpions?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
You guys are missing the obvious

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
answer. What? What's that, Travis?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Steroids. Travis, I don't

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
think that- Wait.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You're running away from me because you want to make these

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
scorpions, like, super

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
beefy? I don't know that they have

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
beef. Right.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I don't know that they have beef to

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
embiffen, you know? I think it's just

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
just skittering- Well, not yet.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Skittering claws? You gotta get them on

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
a regime. It's all

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
chitin and- On a regimen.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It's chitin and just hate in there.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Maybe you could paint their

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
shells like hermit crabs.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
See, I like that. Paint the scorpion

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
for kids.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
This is what I'm talking about.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Can we make scorpions

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
the new Furbies?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Of course. Just a tiny

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
cork on their stingers.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That would be adorable.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
And rubber bands

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
on their claws.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I think scorpions are so hateful that

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
if you cork their tails and

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
rubber banded their claws, that they'd, like,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
learn to bite.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Yeah, they'll grow fangs. Or learn how to use a gun.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Or just become really spiteful.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Use their words to hurt you.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Looking fat today, J-Man.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Hair's looking a little

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
thin.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Not as young as you used to be,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
J-Man. So he turns into

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
little juice.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
It's an old parable. It's an old story

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
of the frog and the scorpion.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The frog gives the scorpion a ride across

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
the river, and halfway across,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
the scorpion starts calling him, I don't know,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
stupid and stuff. And the frog starts crying.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
He's like, why are you such an asshole?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And the scorpion's like, it's in my nature!

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
But then does he sting him?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
No.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Because he's got a tiny cork on his tail.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
He just batters him with the cork.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
He's like, you like that? Ow!

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
New line of frog-safe scorpions.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Each one is $20.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Who is the first to buy?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
God, can you imagine

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
a frog with a scorpion on its

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
back, and the frog is also

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
full of hate? And then like,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
you get that lethality

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
of a scorpion with the mobility of a frog?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Well,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
we're done. Oh, shit. And the frog

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
is secreting some sort of hallucinogen.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
So the scorpion is just

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
freaked out.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
The frog has a really high credit score,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
so he's able to like, get a house.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Why would that be a thing?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Why would that be a thing?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
And one of them is played by Ray Romano.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Oh my god, the frog is Ray Romano.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Ugh.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Oh, and the scorpion's played by Tim Allen.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
We've got a hit! Listen, this has been

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
the least productive

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
meeting we've had about Madagascar 4 yet.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
And I think we need

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
to go back to the drawing board

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
and really see where we went astray.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
We have a theory that it's when we introduce

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
scorpions.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
They ruin everything, including

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
our Madagascar 4 production meetings.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm reading more of this Yahoo answer,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
and I think that a scorpion is a yoga position.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Oh.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Moving on.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
None of that was helpful to this person.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
You don't know.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
You throw it at the wall, you see what it takes.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
They might have found something in there that was useful.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Here's what it takes. Scorpions.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Their feet are like needles.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Hey, brothers.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
There's someone

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
really into yoga

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
that's been screaming at their iPod

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
for five minutes.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
You dumb motherfuckers!

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I'm not saying like, lying like

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I'm not.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I've got a real hearty penis.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
No, I'm not.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I'm not talking about lying like...

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
It's like a can of Senka down there.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
He's talking about lying like saying things like

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
no, I'm not afraid of masks.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah, right. Pretending like I'm not afraid

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
of the robot woman from Superman 3.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Should that come up in casual conversations.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Oh, you know who I like?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
You know what never scared me?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
The HBO logo they used to show

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
for the movies in the 80s.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
It never really scared me.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
You're the ever loving shit out of you.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
No big deal. It was pretty frightening.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Hey, y'all. Thanks for

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
listening to our Best Of episode.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
As you all

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
might have guessed, if you

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
follow us on other social channels, there's

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
a good reason for why we don't have a regular

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
episode out this week and that is

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
that Vine is shutting down

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and I'm just really struggling with it.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, that's the story of the week

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
and Vine...

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I miss it so much.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
I miss it so much. I learned so many

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
valuable lessons from it but now it's just like

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
what's the... like comedy is dead

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
kind of. Yeah, comedy's

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
over. I miss

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
it so much because you know what was nice about it?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It was easy. It was so easy.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Six seconds, one and done.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
One good

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
toot. Yep.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
And that's a viral baby.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
It's viral content.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
No, the real reason why we don't have an episode this...

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Oh, we do have an episode this week but not a normie.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Is that

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Travis and Teresa had a baby.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
What? Yeah, I'm...

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Oh, you're not just finding this out, are you Justin?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
No, I knew that. It was just a little joke for the show.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
See, and that joke was the perfect length

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
of time to go into Vine.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Yes, both

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
baby and mama are doing well.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
It is a girl.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
These are all things that Travis said I was allowed to announce

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
on the show, which is very exciting.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Her name is Bebe.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Barbara Lee McElroy and we are

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
so, so, so happy for Travis and Teresa.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And so we're doing this special

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
episode. I guess another programming note,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
that Casper special that we were

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
talking about doing is going to be not

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
on Halloween, because that's today.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Yeah. But we're going to figure this out

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
sort of as

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
we go. So we ask for your patience

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
and we're going to keep churning out the content

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
for you. And

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
again, congratulations to Travis and Teresa.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
And

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I guess my condolences to myself.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Yep.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Is this before the show or is this

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
in the middle of the show? No, this will be in the middle. Okay, great.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Well, that means that we're in the middle of

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
the money zone and it's time to

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
go there

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and be there. Are we there? Dude, I've

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
been there for the past two minutes. Like I've been getting

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
paid this whole time talking about Vine going down

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
and my new great niece.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Well, that is a, well, she's just

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
your niece. No, but she's great

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
though. She's not. Okay.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
This is the perfect opportunity for me to tell you about

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
a bowl and branch. Getting a great night's sleep

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
is easier and more affordable than you might think.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Griffin, you don't need a new

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
expensive mattress or sleeping pills.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
You need to change your sheets.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Think about it. What's wrong with mine?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
That's what your skin is touching.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
These are a bowl and branch

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
means luxury linens and

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
you're not paying anything. And like what language does

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
that translate to luxury? Just

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
language of brand.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
These are wonderful sheets.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Luxury sheets can cost $20,000

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I bet, but

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
in a store. But bowl and branch are not

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
going to cost that. Not even close. They're like a

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
couple hundred bucks. They'll let you try them

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
risk free for 30 nights. And if you don't love them, you

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
can send them back for a full refund. That's

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
right. You have nothing to lose

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
and they come beautifully packaged

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
in signature boxes that make you feel like

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
a proper little fancy

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
person. Also, these sheets

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
can't be torn up.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
They can't be burned. They're indestructible.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
They are indestructible. They are the

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
golden fleece. They're

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
all made of golden fleece. So when you sleep

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
on them, every night that you sleep on them, your

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
life expectancy increases by one year.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Just to keep that bowl and branch

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
executive list of this from jumping out the window,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I should mention that no, these are not indestructible

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
sheets. They're just regular

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
levels of destructibility.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
We have to say that.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
They're not like more destructible.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah, legally we have to say that, but

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
you guys know.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
You all know what's up.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Bowl and branch is going to give you $50 off

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
your first set of sheets when you go to bowlandbranch.com

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
and use the promo code MYBROTHER. That's

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
$50 off your first set of sheets. Go to

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
bowl, B-O-L-L, and

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
branch.com. Promo code

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
MYBROTHER. They double your

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
proficiency as a lover. You can last

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
twice as long, go twice as hard.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Alright, you do yours now and I'm going to

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
throw shade at you the whole time. I'm not

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
throwing shade. I was a hype

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
man for this product. That's all we're doing here in the

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
money zone. I want to tell all y'all

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
about Wink. I know you're hearing that

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
thinking, who's this new customer?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I don't trust them. Yes, you do trust them

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
because it's Club W.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
They've evolved. Somebody

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
used the

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
leaf stone on Club W

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
and they've evolved into Wink.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Amazing. Wink is

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
well, it's a lot like Club W.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
They are going to help you

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
find the wine that is going to be

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
personalized to your palate. They're going to deliver

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
it right to your door.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
It's called Wink now and that's spelled

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
W-I-N-C.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I know you hear that and you think

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
that's not the normal way

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
it's normally spelled. Well, no.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
It's a new name. It's an improved look.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Here's the important part. Still the same

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
amazing wine company introducing you to

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
wines that you're going to love.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Fantastic.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Tell me more. I will.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Just calm down. I'm kind of flying by the seat of my pants

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
right now. Everything has changed.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
My whole world has changed. Vine is gone.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I've got a second niece. I've got

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
two nieces now and you guys didn't even think about

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
how hard that's going to be for me to keep straight.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Now Club W is called Wink.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
It's not spelled with a K. It's spelled with a C.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
That's great. I just need

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
a minute. Okay? Okay.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Take your time. Wink.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
They work directly with winemakers

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
and growers from all over the world to create delicious

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
wine and they deliver it right to your door.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
They have 100% satisfaction

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
guarantee which means if you don't like a bottle they send you

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
they will replace it with a bottle that you're going to love

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
no questions asked. And that means

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
questions like but you drank the whole bottle

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and you stuck a note inside that said yum yum

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I sure love this.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
We're not going to ask that question. We're not going to

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
ask you about that. We're just going to send you another bottle

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
no questions asked. Whoa.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
The best part is that Wink is going to offer our

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I want to take a

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
moment to

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
mention to you

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
about a new podcast. It's called Driving Miss

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Wiki. Driving

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Miss Wiki is the name of this

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
podcast. It is recorded as the host

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
drives home

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
where the host's passenger

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I wish we had more information

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
about that. I know. I want to actually

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
take the unprecedented step

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
of actually clicking research

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
to the website and researching.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Nope. It's taking too long.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I can't

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
figure it out.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Come on Justin. Hop on Nexus Lexus.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Let's crack this shit.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Driving Miss Wiki is the name of the podcast.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
It is recorded on a drive

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
as a passenger reads to

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
the driver who is also the

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
host. A Wikipedia

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
article and they discuss them.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Past episodes

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
are not episodes. That's not a word.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Wow. You've had a lot of trouble reading this message.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
This is actually your second attempt at it and you

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
fucked it up just as bad as the first.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Thank you. Thank you. I'm just saying it's noteworthy

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
how bad you're doing.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Is Travis the glue that holds this fucking

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
boat together? Has he been holding us together

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
this entire time? The show is called

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Driving Miss Wiki. Let me tell you about it.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
No God. No. Not again.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Some of the

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
topics they've discussed included the company

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
of Merchant Adventures, Marshall

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Island Stick Charts, Prague, Texas

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
and Caruncles.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Those are of course

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
uncle cars.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Cars that are brothers

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
to other cars

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
that have sexually reproduced.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Your hosts are Parker

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
and Mary or Marie

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
perhaps. Let's go with Marie.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah. So I found that out

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
through some research

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
and you can find their podcast at

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
drivingmisswiki.com or

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
by heading over to iTunes

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
and searching for Driving Miss

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Wiki. I also want to

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
shout out this

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
message for Tuna

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
and it's from

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Twin who says happy 30th

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
birthday to my PIC.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
PIC.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Thank you for showing me the wonderful

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
world of podcasts especially

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
my bim bam. I can't wait to record

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
our competing comedy advice

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
podcast and put these clowns out of business for good?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
You the best and I like you

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
a lot? How could you?

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
How could you do this? Did want

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
to get this one on

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
or around July 2nd

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
so

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
pretty good job I thought.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
On that note first of all

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
fucking step up to the plate.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
If you want to step into the terror

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
dome. If you think you're capable

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
go ahead because you

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
know what? Feed my

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Frankenstein. I'm hungry. Yeah come

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
on. Come on. Step

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
up. Many have tried some have failed

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
bring it on.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Also want to say on the subject of us being

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
extremely late on Jumbotrons

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
there's been a freeze on

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
new Jumbotron messages

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
so if you wanted to get a message on the show you

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
haven't been able to for a while because all our spots

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
got done filled up. They're going

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
to open them. This feels like

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
weird to talk about that our listeners are so

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
like down and so supportive

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
that they have flooded us with

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Jumbotron messages. If you want to get a message

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
on the show they're going to open up

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
spots in 2017

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
on November

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
28th. That's Cyber Monday.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
They're going to open up. I

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
say they we don't actually sell

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
the Jumbotron spots. Max Fun handles that

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
for us and so they're going to open up some spots

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
in 2017. If you want to get a message on the show

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
November 28th Cyber Monday

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
those messages are going to

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
those slots are going to open up. So

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
if you want to get a message on the show next year

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
which is like your earliest option

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
go go hop on

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron then

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and good luck.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Good luck.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Anything else bro. Oh God they

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
just announced today

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
and obviously we knew about

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
this the the CISO show

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
that we did. My Brother My Brother and Me

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
TV show has a release date.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Yep February 23rd 2017

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
is when that's going to air

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
and I think I really think

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
you're going to like it a lot. Yeah we've been watching

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
some we've been watching some episodes and they're

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
they're they're good man. I'm really

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
really proud of it and happy about it.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
We made them so we're biased.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I know but like I'm so I'm so

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
excited for everybody else to see them. I

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
really think this is going to be one of those situations

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
where I

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
I'm not embarrassed of a thing

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
that we made which is so rare

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
so rare.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
So that's cool.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Anything else before we let people get back to it.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Not that I can think of.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Thank you all for sticking with us for this

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
best of episode.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I just like

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
sort of blanket like we have some

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
filler Eps prep for all the shows

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
so just expect

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I guess a little bit of

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
what's the word I'm looking for.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
It may not be. I don't know if disruption.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Yeah I don't know what like the next

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
it's because we expected these

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
babies much closer together.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
So I don't know. We don't know exactly

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
how this is all going to

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
go but I think it's going to be

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
just fine. It's going to be just fine.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
We are

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
again so excited for Travis and Theresa

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
and just expect like

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
especially once Rachel and I

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
have our baby in December

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
just like expect this podcast to just be

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
like three fucking Tim Allen's

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
three fucking Ray Romano's just laying

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
it down completely

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
inaccessible to all non dads

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
and they're doing all right.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
You're not a dad. You're locked the fuck

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
out of this humor because it is all

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
all the way down baby

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
all that humor. So anyway

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I stepped on another leg

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
go like shit that you

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
guys are not going to like at all

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
anymore. Like you're going to fucking

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
hate it. That jumbotron problem is going to

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
resolve itself. Yeah we're going to be done

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
with this show. Yeah it's going

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
to be guys it's gonna be

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
shit.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Anyway happy Halloween.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I'm Bez and I'm Theresa and we

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
host the weekly comedy podcast

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
One Bad Mother. We celebrate our moments

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
of parenting genius as well as

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
our failures. Just like

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
we're going to have hot dogs and I'm like

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
no we're having fun everybody loves hot dogs

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
and it just like smashes that thing right on my

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
chest and then I'm just crying in the middle of like

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
kids space while people are like literally dancing with their

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
children. Parenting can be sad and

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
painfully funny at the same time.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
So join us each week as

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
we admit that this is hard but we're getting

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
really good at it. Find us at

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
maximumfun.org or wherever you download

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
podcasts.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It's two words alt

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
tab. Alt

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
tab. Now what does that mean. That's

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
shady though when you see when you

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
walk into somebody and you're like is

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
that a dick and then it

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
flickers really quickly. Whoa whoa whoa how personal

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
do you think this is going.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
They're live streaming a bris.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I assumed it was like

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I assumed it was like they were looking at bee dogs.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Travis no

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
one except you

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
looks at bee dogs. R has

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
ever looked at bee dogs. I think in

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Colombia bee dogs is pretty big.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
When you say bee dogs no

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
one knows what the fuck you're talking

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
about. I think you guys

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
will find that many people know

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
what I'm talking about. No one knows

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
what bee dogs are except you. I think

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
that bee dogs is a pretty big deal.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I want to see how much

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I will tell you that no one knows

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
what bee dogs are.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I think you'll find

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
that bee dogs are pretty

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
popular. It's like listening to

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Mariah Carey kibitz.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
When you bring up bee dogs it makes

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
everybody sadder because they don't know what the fuck

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
you're saying. And it's

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
time for them to learn.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Hey guys I want to talk to you about

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
bee dogs. No, no, no. Fair enough.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
You're not using our show as a

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
platform for spraying your madness.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
What themed party can I

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
have for Halloween? I want to

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
attract lots of lovely ladies.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Oh behave.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Oh no. All right Griffin I'm

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
going to have to take this question away from you.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Okay. Can you

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
please paste the text into

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
our Skype window.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Okay you just typed fuck

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
you.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
That is enough.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
What themed party

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
can I have for Halloween?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I want to

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
attract lots of lovely ladies.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Oh behave.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
That was miserable.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It sounded like Austin Powers had a stroke.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
I did.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh behave.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Can I

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
say something? I think this person

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
has their heart set on a theme.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I think the

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
theme has been decided.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Guys I don't want to get outside of

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
the question but

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
is it possible that this person has just chosen

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
to live an Austin Powers lifestyle?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Oh here.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Can I share

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
the top answer?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Please. The top answer

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
from Yahoo Answers is

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Rock Titan says

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
it's

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
April.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Oh he's the

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
pragmatist. Oh that's great.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
This Yahoo

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Answer is sent in by Diane.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Thanks Diane.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jared

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Ancharski

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
who asks

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I got arrested for smoking weed

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and my court date is soon.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
If I come into court in a karate uniform

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
am I good?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Am I okay here?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
In what context?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Will the judge make my punishment lenient since he knows

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I do karate?

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Exactly.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
If he knows you've got your karate game right?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Additional details.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Since they know I do karate they'll know I do

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
other activities besides chill around

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
and smoke so will that help or no?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
See this

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
it's like an onion this question.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Now this

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
only works if you do a fashion

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
show. So you come in your karate outfit

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and then you come in your horse riding outfit.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
This is a hard hat.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I do construction things.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And also I'm a milkman apparently.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Someone give me a hammer.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Boy was I ever lucky to get

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Judge Samo Hung.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
He's been very lenient

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
about my gi.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Samo Hung

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
was one of the karate guys

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
on Walker Texas Ranger.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Go on.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
One of the karate guys on Walker Texas Ranger.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I could have gone for Chuck Norris but I feel like

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
his

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I think the thing

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Chuck Norris is a hanging judge.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Everyone knows that.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Is there anything this gentleman

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
can wear other

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
than a suit

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
that he says I heart judges.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
OK but that's

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
that's probably not going to do it because I think

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I don't think you can wear any shirt that says I

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
heart anything on it and then I heart judges

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
a lot. People don't what about a sarcastic

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
maybe a Judge Reinhold

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
mask.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Hey listen judge to judge

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
are we cool. Am I good.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I've got this Judge

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Reinhold mask and a karate gi.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Are we going to waive these charges

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
or what. Can we can we work that

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
into our catchphrase vernacular.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Am I good.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Anytime you say

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
something terrible or faux pas

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
just real quick. Oh shit. Am I good.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Am I good.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Hey I came to court in a karate gi.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Am I good.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
So I'm just going to go. I assume

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
the charges have been dropped. Uh huh. Am I good.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I just

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I just chopped your gavel in half.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Am I good.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
What's that smell.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
It's not weed. I promise.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
To what extent

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
does the color of

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
belt that this person has

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
all the difference in the world.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
OK.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I mean either way you chop it

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
if he's got a white belt

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
he's not going to a intimidate the judge or

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
be impress him with

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
the amount of time that he has spent in karate

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
chopping class. You can get the

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
white belt blue belt brown

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
belt yellow belt all within

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
like a week and a half if

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
you pay and if you slip a few you know extra

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
hundo's to your sensei.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
From what I've seen

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
there if you were to graph my

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
respect for people in

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
the martial arts it's a pretty

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
steady curve up until you hit

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
black belt and then it

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
branches pretty radically

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
in two different directions where

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
on the one hand I am

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
for some of those people

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I am like wow really

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
odd by the dedication to your

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
craft and then the other people

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
it's like just

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
put on just get a job

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
put on a suit and

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
learn how to play lacrosse and

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
please get your life together.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It just strikes me as one of those things that in my life if someone

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
were to say to me oh yeah I have a black belt

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
the next two words out of my

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
mouth are prove it.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I don't know

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
what that entails I don't know if that's like

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
chop through this wall or fight me

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
or what it is but there's something about someone

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
making that statement where I'm like

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
oh yeah prove it.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Chop that horse in half.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
A black belt is really only

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
a value add to a person

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
when nobody knows

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
that they have it.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
If I got a black belt I wouldn't tell

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
fucking I would go take my classes

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
in another state.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
So that people would. What classes?

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh karate classes. Karate classes.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And then when I came

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
back and like if shit came down

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
and I did a chop and a kick

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
and a man died then people would be like what?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I'd be like oh don't worry about it.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I would never ever admit the fact that I have a black.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Spray your jacket to the side and show them just a

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
little glimpse of black belt. Because if

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I ever said the word out loud to somebody oh I have

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
a black belt they're gonna make all kinds of wild

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
assumptions about me. Right.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Which are probably all going to be true. They're going to be

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
very true. But I would rather

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
not be subject to that.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Do you think that when you get the black belt itself

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
it's reversible?

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
In case you want to wear brown shoes?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Idiot.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
So this is why. This is your

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
outfit okay. You come into court.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
You're wearing black dress shoes

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
a black belt and you have a tie.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
You go to the judge and you say

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
am I good?

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
As you can see

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I'm in my formal gi.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Am I good?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
This is my dress gi. Am I good?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I have a funeral to go to.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I'm gonna karate chop the

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
coffin in half.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I can't believe you'd hold a karate master

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
here.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
You don't know the lightning you're bottling

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
up here. You can't put

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
me in a cell. I will not be responsible

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
for the damage I do

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
if you lock me in a cell with another person.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I'll whittle their bones down

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
and make a ki. I can't be

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
responsible. I don't know that karate

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
is the kind of thing that you can do if you're high

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
on that sweet sweet dojo.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
If you're rocking dojo

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I don't think that

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
your skills are going to be as

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
high as you want them to be.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
No

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
Three puns intended.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Yes and no.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
To the outside observer

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
you will be very bad at karate.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
To your own perception

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
you will be on a fucking

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
kung fu other plane kill

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
bill style.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Body parallel flat to the ground.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
You against the crazy 88's

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
just losing your mind, chopping off

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
limbs. Mortal Kombat

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
fly through the air bicycle kick.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
You're just laying on the ground

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
and rolling about. You're

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
listening to 311 and you're eating Starburst.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I got a

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
FTP login you can check

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
out. You're gonna love

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
my files and folders.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Don't go too many trees deep

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
cause it gets weird.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Stay in the index.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Let's just say stay in the index.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
If you find yourself four or five folders in

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
just unplug your

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
computer. Just pull this string and I'll get you

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
out.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
You need Joseph Gordon Levitt to give

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
you the kick.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Unless you don't like horse assholes.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Get Joseph Gordon Levitt to give you

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
the kick.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
This yahoo was sent in by

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Liana which was

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
sent to her by her friend Keith.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
So thank you both people

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
in this arrangement.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Many

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
boffins died to bring us this yahoo

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
so let's really enjoy it.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
It was asked by yahoo answers user

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Geof who asks

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
is it okay to draw on a dog

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
with magic marker?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Sometimes when my

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
stepdad Ron grounds me I'll write

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
messages on

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
my dog. He is white with

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
washable marker and send him downstairs.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Just little messages like

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
if I need food or about how much I

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
hate my stepdad Ron.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
My mom

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
said it would make the dog sick. Is she right?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
So many

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
more problems with the best stepdad

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
name ever is Ron.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Got some dog mail for you Ron.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Fuck off.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I hate you Ron.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I hate you so much. Come here Mr.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Perkins. What's it?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Aw man.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
That really helps. That hurts myself as

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I'm trying so hard. That hurts my Ron

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
esteem. I don't like that one bit.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Can you give me the

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
question one more time Griffin? Is it

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
okay to draw on a dog with magic marker?

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Sometimes when my stepdad Ron grounds me

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I'll write messages on my dog.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
He is white

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
with magic marker. Just little messages

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
like if I need food or about how

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
much I hate my stepdad Ron.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm imagining like a Yorkshire terrier

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
like bounding down the stairs running up

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
to Ron and it's like a message on him

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
like hey Ron I smell that chili. What the

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
fuck? You're such a bastard. I'm super

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
hungry. I got a message for you

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Ron. I'm a dog.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And also the person asking this question

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
is 32. Yeah.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
God damn you Ron.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Now listen to me Sparky. I want you to go

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
upstairs. I want you to find Ron.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I want you to just wiggle in front of him.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
You gotta make sure he reads this. It's important.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I've been trapped under this bookcase

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
for two weeks. I gotta get some

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
pasta up here. I'm so hungry. Also tell

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Ron fuck you Ron.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
If Ron wants to rescue

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
me tell him to fuck clean off. I hate

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Ron. Tell him to send my mom

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and ask if my mom is back

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
with my fruit roll ups yet.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I sent her to the store

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
20 minutes ago for fruit roll ups.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Mr. Perkins you look kind of sick.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
What happened?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Is it the markers?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Is it your skin? It's you or me

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Mr. Perkins.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Maybe you learned how to talk English.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Stupid dog.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Poor Ron.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
What a fucking

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
sick bird. He's just trying to watch Extreme Home Makeover

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and all of a sudden the dog

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
trots in front of the screen. It looks like a drawing of a knife

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
stabbed and an arrow

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
that says Ron. This is you Ron.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
This is what I want to do to you. Look at the dog.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Oh Jesus.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It says I love you Ron. I'm my dog.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Oh he rolled over. It says no I don't.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And it says fuck you Ron again on it.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
With an arrow towards the dog's penis.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Tyler I thought

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
you were going to come pick me up from work.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Did you not read the dog?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I said fuck you and fuck your job.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I'm not coming to pick you up.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And also that we were out of eggs.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Did you tell mom?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I wrote it on the dog Ron.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
What else do you want me to do?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I can't force

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
the dog to stand in front of you all day.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Please just read the dog.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You used all the paper for your stupid

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
novel Ron.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
How's that going Ron? Did you find a

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
publisher yet?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
In this economy Ron you might as well

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
self publish your stupid shit.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Put it on Kindle.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I've got a Tumblr dog.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Where I just put messages. Why can't you get a Tumblr dog?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Can we

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
make it a new law?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Sort of like in Game of Thrones

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
if you're a bastard your name is Snow.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Can we make it that the second you become

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
a stepdad your name just becomes

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Ron by law?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Legally speaking

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I now pronounce you wife and

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Ron.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's not even your name so much as

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
like Earl.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
It's like an honorary title but his name is not Earl.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
You're officially like the Don

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
of this house.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You're the Ron.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You're the Ron Don.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
So let's see.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You've got to get WednesdayWolf.com

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the imps.org

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
mobrulesgames.com

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and indiegogo.com

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Actually Mob Rules Games

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I already busted one out for them.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I will give them a final draft of that

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
come the end of this promotion.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Don't take this the wrong way.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
The imps and WednesdayWolf.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I like the idea of Daymere pile of

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
watercolor donors.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Start there.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
What does that cover?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
That covers WednesdayWolf

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
and the imp.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It covers all three?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
They all want money.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
That's the connector. Everybody wants money.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Here we go.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Hold on.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Let me take a try.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Build a Daymere

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
pile of

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
watercolor donors.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
All these businesses need funds

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
to operate.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You can help WednesdayWolf

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
the imps don't

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
take the wrong way.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
That's almost what it's called.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But I ran out of words in the verse.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Go give them some cash

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
to chase all of their

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
dreams around.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I like how it ended on some of that unresolved

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
dreams of

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
dreams.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I don't know guys.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Build a Daymere

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
pile of

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
watercolor donors.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
You need to give

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
these people lots of cash.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's how the market works.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
They take your money and turn

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
it into goods and services.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
You can take those services

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
to the bank.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
While they take your

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
literal money to the bank.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Visit

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
WednesdayWolf.com

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
the imps.org and don't take this the

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
wrong way's website which you can probably find

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:25.000
on google.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Fuck.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Make sure to join us at

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
party on McGillicuddy's deck.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
To the sequel.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Party your deck off at

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
McGillicuddy's.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Get your deck wet.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Come get your deck wet with $2

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
washer splashes all night long.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The hottest

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
babes. The hottest guys.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
The drunkest children.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
The wildest monkeys.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
The craziest poop throwing monkeys

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
you've ever seen. And good

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
news ladies. Margaritas

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
are just $3 all night long.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Monkeys get in free till

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
midnight.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Hey monkey it's 1230.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Come on in anyway.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's McGillicuddy.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
21 and up for male monkeys.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
18 for female monkeys.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I don't even know if monkeys live that long.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
What the fuck.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Half man half monkeys will be submitted

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
for study at

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
research institutes nationwide.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
So

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
summer's here. Summer's here

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
again. Do you guys wanna

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
yahoo answer? Yes.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah. This one was sent in by Josh

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Papow. I haven't

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
decided if it's the kind of question

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
that we could get

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
in trouble for reading yet.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Okay. Yay.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Thank you Josh. So yahoo

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
answers to your question Mark who asked

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
really freaked out my girlfriend. Need help?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
As a teenager I suffered

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
from severe depression

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and formed a strong bond with the character

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Garfield and his outlook.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It's sad but

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
reading

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Garfield anthologies obsessively was

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
the only thing that made me feel normal.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And it eventually took on something

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
of an erotic fixation.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh no.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And I think you mispronounced

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
normal.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Reading Garfield books obsessively made me

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
feel normal.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
To avoid feeling like a sicko

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I drew pictures of Garfield with

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
a woman's I think a Pamela Anderson

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
circa 1991 body

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and Garfield's head.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
These drawings eventually evolved into

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
erotic fan fiction starring Garfield and myself.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
In my head Garfield still

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
has a woman's body but someone

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
reading the stories would think I'm having sex

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
with regular Garfield. I killed

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
off John in a jealous rage.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I didn't touch Odie. I enjoy his

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
companionship and don't mind if he watches.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
What the fuck?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The stories are your pretty basic wish

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
fulfillment stuff balanced with a

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
self loathing rants.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yeah pretty basic stuff.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Nothing out of the ordinary here.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I've been doing this near daily for years

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
and I have a substantial amount of writing in a folder

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I keep buried in eight different folders.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
My girlfriend stumbled

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
across them by accident when they came

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
up in a search and is pretty freaked out.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
How can I show her I'm just a

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
normal guy with a weird outlet

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
from my psychological problems and not

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
some kind of sicko. And then they

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
included a sample of some of the erotic fiction

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and I didn't think I would ever

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
say this on this podcast but it's too

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
gross to read out loud.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Guys I know different

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
strokes for different folks.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
We've all got something

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
buried deep inside that you

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
never ever ever want

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
anybody to know ever. Now I'm not

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
saying mine would be as weird

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
as putting a woman's body

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
on Garfield's head but it's

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
pretty fucking weird. The secret

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
to not getting made fun of

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
is that you can't tell the entire

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
world which is on the

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
internet. This is a secret

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
you can never. You're embarrassed your

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
girlfriend found out so you decided to put it on

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
the internet? How bad are you at

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
internet? You can't hide a yahoo

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
answer in folders.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
No. Cause I found it.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I found it and I know it forever now.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Yeah. I'm just

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
if Jim Davis ever saw these drawings

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I think he would literally fucking die.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I think he would fucking die. I think his

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
heart would explode in his chest and he would die.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He would say my baby! And then he'd die.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Hey real quick. Just for a second.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Let's play devil's advocate

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
here and just like get ourselves in

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
this guy's head space and just like imagine.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
No I'm not. I don't want to do that at all.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Come through the door.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We're gonna step into this

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
guy's mind. What if I die

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
in this dream? If you die in the dream you'll be

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
stuck in Garfield fucking limbo

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
forever. You need Joseph Gordon

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Leavitt to give you the kick. Yeah yeah.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
He'll kick you in the head until you die.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Give me the kick. I'm ready.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Which

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
would you

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
come on

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
which would you prefer?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Pamela Anderson body and Garfield

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
head or Garfield body and Pamela Anderson head?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
If you had to

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
party down on one of those bad

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
boys

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
which would you go with?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Additional information. The Garfield head is wearing

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
sunglasses.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Garfield

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
body suction cup hands or no suction

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
cup hands?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Either or.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Whichever would be more

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
pleasurable. Is Odie there

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
and is he just jerking it so

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
right? Odie loves what he sees.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Either way

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Odie's down.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Odie is down to clown.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Justin do you want to pick first?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Well Griffin

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
you ask the questions so you have to answer.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Fuck.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'll say

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I'll say

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
if it's Bill Murray's voice

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Pam body

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Garfield head. Travis?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Oh no I've already killed myself

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
in this situation.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Can I

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
throw Travis's body at the corpse

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
and buy myself enough time

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Travis's corpse at the

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
creation and buy myself enough time

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Here's the problem though. You throw it at Pam body

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Garf head. Who's that coming up from behind?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It's Garf body Pam head

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and it is

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
very upset.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
For many reasons. You have

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
in your inventory a dagger

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and a shield.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Open doors are

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
west and north.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Okay can I

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I am going to go

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
with Pam head

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Garfield body but Lorenzo

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
music voice.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I have a thing

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
with the real Ghostbusters so

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I think that would be enough to get me through it

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and also

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You're worried about finishing?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I can't

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I can't

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
You also changed Pam Anderson's

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
voice to Garfield's.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Now listen if I have

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I have too much respect for Bill Murray's

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
work. If it's Lorenzo music

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
But you could have left Pamela Anderson's voice

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Why does it have to be Garfield's voice?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I don't see why Pam Anderson's voice is not going to come out of

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Garfield's head.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And I

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
find Larry the crash test dummy

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
to be a very soothing sexual influence

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So if I can pretend

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that if it's Lorenzo music's voice

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
and I can pretend it's Peter

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Venkman of the Ghostbusters cartoon

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
or Larry the crash test dummy

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
or perhaps even tummy gummy from

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Disney's Avengers gummy bears

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
How many other cartoons can you ruin for me right now?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I can't

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's all Lorenzo music that I'm aware of

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
He's probably something else

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That thought didn't even

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
The thought of what would be the most

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
sexually pleasurable

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That didn't even cross my mind. This was pure

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
survival instincts

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I've got all of these pizza shaped disks

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
left over from my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
sewer boat

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Just the disks. I got rid of the boat

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
but I've probably got 150 of them

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Right. Different years

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
If you come over to Travis's house

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
he's coming to the pizza disk room

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and he's showing you

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
the ones with small factory imperfections

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and that kind of thing

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Basically all I did was just stable them to the wall

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
directly. There's no

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
furniture in the room. There's a body

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
but I don't ask about it

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
There are five

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
people right now who just threw

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
down their iPod and ran into their

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
attic like, where's my fucking pizza launcher?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Dad!

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Dad! Dad!

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Dad! You promised

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
You said that

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
if I kept up my GPA that you wouldn't

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
throw away my pizza launcher

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
What do you mean I'm 32?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
What do you mean you died 7 years ago?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Dad! How long have I been asleep?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Dad!

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Dad!

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I think that old man was a genie

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Dad!

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I think I got a genie curse

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Dad!

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I don't know what you want

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
He says he's governor

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
What's going on?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I used to be Zac Efron and now I'm Steve Buscemi

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Help me!

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Dad!

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I've got adult

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
balls and no pizza launcher

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
What gives?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Dad!

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I wanted my suit to fit over the counter

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
What's going on?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
They said I couldn't

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
at the store

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Is that a

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
problem you would like to?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I can't find

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Jost on the shelves!

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Dad!

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I've been without electricity

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
for a week

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
and while I was without

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
electricity I started reading books

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Oh, I see

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Okay, so this is books, man

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
This is educated

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Justin

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
This is your brain on books

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
This is what they do

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
So in your mind this is what educated people sound like?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
in circles

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I am in electoral circles

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
This is what my friends

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
and I, this is how we speak

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Justin, I want you to know

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I picture you right now surrounded by bookcases

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
but your brain has swollen and you just have like a giant

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
forehead

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Tell me

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I have become top heavy

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
but without electricity I was not able

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to watch my programs

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I was not able to play video games

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and I was forced

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
to read and now I've been exposed

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
to all the great culture

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
of the world

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
How

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
How sallow is

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
your skin? Can you give me some sort of

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
salowness rating?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
It looks like an orange fruit

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
by the bottom

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Did you get

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
a book jaundice? What happened?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
No, he was just reading books and eating

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
carrots the entire time

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
As they ran out of power they had to eat their

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
stock of baby carrots

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I was forced

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
to eat the butterflies I've

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
preserved over the years behind

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
glass

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Nutritionally devoid

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
but

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
surprisingly very pleasing

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
to the palate

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Yeah

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
All that voice wants to do is eat something

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
beautiful

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
So this is our advice program

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
My brother, my brother and me

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
will dole out

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
intellectual

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
conversational

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
advice

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
You're hearing like hard right, what is this voice

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
doing? I think he's just

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
turning into a condor also

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
It's

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
bucking underneath me

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Bucking wildly

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It wants desperately to go scar's guard

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I won't

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
let it. I'm holding on to the reins

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
as sadly as I can

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Oh god it's devolved

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
into Ed Grimley. Somebody help me
