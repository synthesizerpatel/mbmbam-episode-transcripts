00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:47.200
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

00:47.200 --> 00:51.440
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.600
I'm your babiest baby brother Griffin McElroy.

00:53.600 --> 01:00.400
It's Summertime!

01:07.680 --> 01:11.360
Billy Stewart of course with that version of Summertime. It was me

01:11.360 --> 01:16.880
in my Billy Stewart impersonation, but Island Boy rises right now. I'm on that island time.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.040
The Island Boy returns.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.600
Some people just want to watch the world sunburn.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.600
Yeah, he's not the boy we want, and that's the end of the sentence.

01:28.240 --> 01:33.200
Island Boy has returned to you. I'm continuing my tour of the

01:34.480 --> 01:41.520
islands of the southeastern United States. I have fully sown my seeds of party throughout

01:41.520 --> 01:48.080
Tybee Island, and Georgia's Tybee Island. I've moved on to Pawleys Island, South Carolina,

01:48.080 --> 01:52.160
and I am here, uh, just living. Is that Island Boy?

01:53.920 --> 01:56.720
My island phone's going off. One second. Hello?

01:56.720 --> 02:01.200
Hi, it's, uh, wow, it sounds like I'm talking to you on two coconuts that are just kind of

02:01.200 --> 02:02.880
stapled together. Is that true?

02:03.760 --> 02:05.440
That's right. Go for Island Boy.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.880
Hi, Island Boy. This is Pawley. Um, just, I heard you're staying on my island this weekend

02:10.880 --> 02:15.600
and this week, and I hope you have just a great time. Be careful of those jelly sharks,

02:15.600 --> 02:20.960
and just wanted to ask you, did do want to ask you to please just stop sowing your seed

02:20.960 --> 02:25.040
all around my island. That'd be terrific, thanks. I would hate to remove you from the island.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.000
I, uh, I can't help it.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.880
By the way, is Pawley Jimmy Stewart's brother?

02:30.880 --> 02:35.920
Yeah, it's me, Jimmy Pawley, and I own an island, and it's covered in cum.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.200
And I'm calling you specifically about the cum, Clarence.

02:41.200 --> 02:47.440
I, uh, I, uh, have been living that island lifestyle so deep. You know me, right? I get

02:47.440 --> 02:53.600
here first things first. I jump right into the ocean to just start to renew and replenish,

02:53.600 --> 02:59.120
and then I got stung by a jellyfish, and then I came back in, and that was about 10 minutes of

02:59.120 --> 03:03.520
good, just like good, solid ocean time I've had since I've been here.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.960
Have you been visited? Have you been visited by the Sunshine Man?

03:06.960 --> 03:14.080
Uh, he is, he has kissed, his sweet solar kisses all over my body, uh, and by which,

03:14.080 --> 03:19.680
I mean, the very tops of my shoulder blades that got, that could be, uh, reached by the sun

03:19.680 --> 03:22.640
through my, uh, chair with a built-in umbrella.

03:22.640 --> 03:22.960
Okay.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.800
So that, that's, none of that's a joke.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.920
Hey, has Cra, has Crabbington come around these parts in a bit?

03:28.720 --> 03:29.360
Uh, what?

03:29.360 --> 03:33.920
Crabbington? I'm, I'm starting to sort of develop out the island boy fiction. I'm

03:33.920 --> 03:36.960
imagining sort of a Gullah Gullah Island situation.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.440
Sure, yeah.

03:37.440 --> 03:42.560
Is Crabbington like the Alfred of this scenario, where he is a fairly large,

03:42.560 --> 03:44.960
but not quite man-sized crab?

03:44.960 --> 03:48.800
I think he's just a small crab, and he wants to steal your snacks from your beach picnic.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.960
Oh, Crabbington's like the Swiper.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.440
Yeah, Swiper, no swiping.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.240
I was just picturing Crabbington with like, maybe like a, uh, uh, uh, like a,

03:58.240 --> 04:01.040
one of those Jimmy Buffett beers in each claw.

04:01.040 --> 04:01.840
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.520
Bringing it out to you, and maybe one's for you and one's for him after a long day of

04:05.520 --> 04:06.800
crabbing around.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.360
Okay, so sort of a, sort of a party crap.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.360
Oh, and that is, that is, by the way, his catchphrase, just crabbing around.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.320
All right, very, very lucrative.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.880
I want to tell you, I had an island boy adventure this morning I want to share with you guys.

04:20.880 --> 04:25.600
I, uh, went, I went out for, I threw on my sneaks and went out for my run,

04:25.600 --> 04:28.960
because I got to keep my couch to 5k streak going.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.200
Getting camera ready for this September.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.480
Should I be doing that?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.840
Oh, I've been going the other way.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.720
I've been eating a lot more fried chicken to bulk up.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.640
Wait, am I doing this wrong?

04:39.520 --> 04:43.280
I'm trying to get camera ready, so I went out on the beach, because what better place

04:43.280 --> 04:44.560
for a run than the beach?

04:44.560 --> 04:47.920
One thing I do have to note, it's very hard to run on sand.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.400
Yeah.

04:48.400 --> 04:54.960
So after I did, I ran about, um, a mile and a half, and I felt like I was going to die

04:54.960 --> 04:56.960
there, so I decided to come back.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.600
And as I came back, I realized that I did not pay very close attention to what the back

05:01.600 --> 05:02.800
of this beach house looked like.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.160
Uh oh.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.360
Oopsie daisy.

05:06.080 --> 05:12.320
So, fucking island boy had a little adventure of his own, where he was just slogging through

05:12.320 --> 05:17.440
sand, half dead, up to like the back doors of houses, trying to peer in there to see

05:17.440 --> 05:18.960
if this is the place he would stay.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.200
Oh no, island boy was arrested this week.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.440
Who's that, who's that at the back door?

05:23.440 --> 05:24.720
Oh, it's just island boy.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.440
Come to give us some of that good news.

05:27.440 --> 05:32.640
Long story short, I had to use Google Maps to navigate back to my house on the beach.

05:32.640 --> 05:32.960
Island boy.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.280
You would survive well in the apocalypse, Justin.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.400
Island boy, I thought you had a strict no tech rule when you were out enjoying the ocean's

05:40.400 --> 05:41.360
bounties.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.720
Well, solar powered only.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.480
That's the one thing about it, is that they have to be solar powered.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.680
Solar phone.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.000
The only kind of phone I-B uses.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Let me juice that up for you, I-B.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.000
Thanks, sunshine man.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.840
Do you want some of these drugs?

05:55.840 --> 05:57.280
No, sunshine man.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.320
Tell me some of that good news.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.800
Okay, I'm gonna go now, sunshine man.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.480
I'm a little uncomfortable.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.720
Please stop kissing my shoulders, sunshine man.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.600
You're tan now, I can see those freckies.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.640
Okay, I'm gonna go be with my family now, sunshine man.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.840
I have to go.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.920
Please move away from the door.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.040
You got a few unfreckled bits left.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.480
Okay, I guess I can stay for a couple more minutes.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.120
Hate this, you're ruining that island boy style.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.280
How did you feel about Crab-

06:31.280 --> 06:32.720
Let's do a quick focus test.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.240
How did you feel about Sunshine Man and Cravington, the new characters introduced

06:36.880 --> 06:38.400
from the island boy canon?

06:38.400 --> 06:41.280
I liked the gritty reboot of Sunshine Man.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.560
Yeah, did you-

06:42.560 --> 06:43.840
Sorry, my phone broke up.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.360
Did you say shitty reboot?

06:45.360 --> 06:45.860
Yes.

06:45.860 --> 06:50.420
I like the original Sunshine Man when it's Frank Gorshin.

06:50.420 --> 06:52.580
He was the way better Sunshine Man.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.220
They switched them and you thought they wouldn't notice.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.700
Let's do some advice maybe.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.500
I'm faced with a bit of a dilemma.

07:00.500 --> 07:05.620
I have two daughters, 12 and 15, and for their entire lives, I've been doing my utmost

07:05.620 --> 07:10.100
to convince them that unicorns are real and that they live in a secret reserve in Florida.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.620
I approve.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.900
It's been getting progressively harder as they get older, but they still love me.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.980
It's been getting progressively harder as they get older, but they still believe and

07:16.980 --> 07:19.140
they often get into arguments with their friends on the issue.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.340
They already know about Santa and the Tooth Fairy.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.660
I want to keep their childhood as magical as possible.

07:24.660 --> 07:25.700
So my question is this.

07:27.300 --> 07:32.900
Do I maintain this facade of a unicorn laying earth in their eyes until they grow up and

07:32.900 --> 07:34.020
go out into the world on their own?

07:34.020 --> 07:39.140
Or do I break the news to them now and hope that I haven't done irreparable damage already?

07:39.700 --> 07:43.460
And that's for Hunting for Magic in Huntington, England.

07:43.460 --> 07:47.460
Huntington, Huntington, England, not West Virginia.

07:47.460 --> 07:47.860
Sorry.

07:47.860 --> 07:50.340
So the location here is actually extremely helpful.

07:51.060 --> 07:56.100
Because I think if you live in England, you are allowed to say anything lives in Florida

07:56.100 --> 08:01.700
because you'll never you'll never get like who in England is like got to get to Florida.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.660
Yeah, Florida has swimming tiny dinosaurs in it.

08:04.660 --> 08:06.980
So why the fuck would there be unicorns?

08:06.980 --> 08:10.980
Yeah, here's a here's a new character working on.

08:10.980 --> 08:14.820
It's called British person that's been obsessed with going to Disney World their

08:14.820 --> 08:16.500
entire life and finally gets to go.

08:16.500 --> 08:16.820
All right.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.860
God blimey, Mickey's so big, isn't he?

08:19.860 --> 08:22.660
He's so tall with the little daycaps.

08:22.660 --> 08:23.700
I'm going to spin around.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.940
Can we make this more of a broad character who and apparently this is the episode just

08:27.940 --> 08:29.860
a lot of character work.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.740
But I would love to hear a version of that.

08:32.740 --> 08:36.820
And it's just but it's just a British person just like psyched to just sort of generally

08:36.820 --> 08:37.940
go to Florida.

08:37.940 --> 08:43.620
Yeah, oh, oh, my, there's lots of water taffy down there in there.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.980
Lots of orange.

08:44.980 --> 08:48.340
You know, when you come in the state, they give you free orange juice, don't they?

08:48.340 --> 08:52.740
I feel like you're doing a lot of Eliza Doolittle is very excited to go to Florida.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.020
That does that, Travis.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.460
You jumped ahead in the narrative.

08:55.460 --> 08:59.620
It does parallel Pygmalion in many in many regards.

09:01.380 --> 09:05.780
That's my favorite part of My Fair Lady when they go to Florida for one episode.

09:05.780 --> 09:13.460
That one episode of My Fair Lady where they do the Disney World special and they do a

09:13.460 --> 09:15.140
crossover with Boy Meets World.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.460
Find that haunted tiki doll.

09:17.460 --> 09:21.300
That's my favorite My Fair Lady episode.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.980
Just taking some lessons with My Fair Lady.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.980
My Fair Lady is filmed for a live studio audience.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.860
Yeah, back up the suitcase, Eliza.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.300
We're going to Florida.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.900
What I like about-

09:34.900 --> 09:37.780
Starring Renee Zellweger as Eliza Doolittle.

09:37.780 --> 09:42.740
Now what's up, Florida?

09:42.740 --> 09:46.580
I think that Florida is the perfect place because I live in West Virginia and I would

09:46.580 --> 09:49.780
believe fucking anything you told me about Florida right now.

09:49.780 --> 09:53.220
Anything you told me is down there, I would absolutely believe it.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.700
Island Boys only nemesis, Florida, ma'am.

09:57.140 --> 09:57.780
I don't see.

09:57.780 --> 10:01.220
I think if you're on a different continent, anything goes.

10:01.220 --> 10:06.260
That's that's that's fact that you can't like there's you have plausible European

10:06.260 --> 10:07.300
deniability.

10:07.300 --> 10:12.500
And not only that, this is one of those that like I have known parents and I have known

10:13.060 --> 10:20.340
the children of parents who have been convinced of way like more detrimental things that like

10:20.340 --> 10:24.740
they realized weren't true when they got older or like they hit 20 and they're like,

10:24.740 --> 10:26.340
wait, that's how cars work?

10:26.340 --> 10:34.580
Oh, no, like this is I think there are unicorns in Florida is is in no way a detrimental thing

10:34.580 --> 10:39.380
for someone to believe as long as possible, unless like you have convinced them that those

10:39.380 --> 10:43.780
unicorns will also like save them from any danger or something.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.060
I think that right.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.460
I think it's OK to be like, yeah, there's totally unicorns.

10:47.460 --> 10:48.180
Don't worry about it.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.300
There's magic in the world.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.260
I love you very much.

10:50.260 --> 10:55.140
Please experience life through rose colored glasses for just one day more before you realize

10:55.140 --> 10:56.340
how shitty stuff can be.

10:58.900 --> 11:03.140
I mean, I don't see why we have to say that corns don't exist.

11:03.140 --> 11:10.500
Maybe they because like there's there's quadruped horse like animals with horns on them.

11:11.060 --> 11:11.380
Yes.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.580
And they sometimes they probably only have one.

11:14.580 --> 11:20.500
Listen, there's whole like there's billions of miles of ocean we haven't explored.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.140
Exactly what I keep coming back to, Travis.

11:23.140 --> 11:28.740
Absolutely, for all we know, there's a biosphere down there that like and I'm not even talking

11:28.740 --> 11:33.460
about like ocean, you talk about like land unicorns that have retreated to below the

11:33.460 --> 11:36.500
ocean to be safe from our prying human eyes.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.260
Oh, because, you know, we discover unicorns on a Monday.

11:40.260 --> 11:44.180
By Thursday, we have figured out a way to eat those horns.

11:44.180 --> 11:45.060
Oh, yes, very much.

11:45.060 --> 11:45.700
No question.

11:45.700 --> 11:50.660
We're making corn nuggets and we don't we don't want that.

11:50.660 --> 11:54.340
So I'm saying that I think that there is listen, there's a lot.

11:54.340 --> 11:59.540
Maybe there were unicorns and like everything got real messed up in the dark ages.

11:59.540 --> 12:02.420
And the unicorns like, well, we're going to the moon now.

12:02.420 --> 12:07.140
Maybe one day we'll return when you stop being shitty and stuff.

12:07.140 --> 12:11.780
And they're just I look at us every night from the moon thinking, I hope soon.

12:11.780 --> 12:12.420
Not yet.

12:12.420 --> 12:12.900
I hope soon.

12:13.860 --> 12:14.980
We're running out of oxygen.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.900
Quick thought exercise.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.260
We find unicorns.

12:18.260 --> 12:18.820
They're real.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.740
Yeah, we cut off the horn.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.660
How do you guys think we do eat the horn?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.100
How do you think you eat the horn?

12:26.100 --> 12:31.220
Because I could see the two that immediately leap to mind is slip it onto your finger

12:31.940 --> 12:33.460
and eat it like a bugle.

12:34.100 --> 12:39.540
Or maybe you have to peel that like conical sort of design down.

12:39.540 --> 12:41.700
I thought grated onto nachos.

12:43.060 --> 12:43.540
Sorry?

12:43.540 --> 12:44.980
Grated onto nachos.

12:44.980 --> 12:45.700
Oh, yeah.

12:45.700 --> 12:46.900
Grated onto nachos.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.140
Sure.

12:47.140 --> 12:52.900
That's definitely like a hard cheese, like a so the outside is more of a rind.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.020
Yeah, inside.

12:54.020 --> 12:59.540
OK, I'm into I'm into the bugle idea, but I'd like to do it my preferred way of doing bugles,

12:59.540 --> 13:01.620
which is sort of like a fun little aperitif.

13:04.100 --> 13:09.300
Just get some some stuffed witch fingers, just like get a can of easy cheese and you

13:09.300 --> 13:14.340
put the nozzle in there and you sort of you sort of deposit it directly into the receptacle.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.500
And then you eat the whole kit and caboodle.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.740
Of course, with a unicorn horn, I wouldn't want to just put spray can cheese in there

13:20.740 --> 13:25.220
and also like some sort of cryptozoological thing in there.

13:25.220 --> 13:31.060
So maybe like a maybe just like sort of chupacabra jelly.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.820
Or like a sasquatch cheese.

13:32.820 --> 13:33.620
It's a mammal.

13:33.620 --> 13:34.580
It has nipples.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.300
If I learned anything from Meet the Parents, you can milk it.

13:39.220 --> 13:40.340
Some yeti butter.

13:40.340 --> 13:42.100
Yeti, yeti, yeti sauce.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.260
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

13:44.900 --> 13:45.220
Sure.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.660
Oh, were we not just doing one?

13:47.860 --> 13:48.340
Oh, yeah.

13:48.340 --> 13:49.140
Oops.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.500
This one was sent in by level 9000.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.540
Yahoo Drew, Drew Devonport.

13:51.540 --> 13:51.940
Thank you, Drew.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.140
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

13:53.140 --> 13:53.860
They are anonymous.

13:53.860 --> 13:54.660
We will call them.

13:56.340 --> 14:02.580
Frankfurt asks, how do I choose between two barbers?

14:03.700 --> 14:07.460
I have two barbers that normally cut my hair, but usually only one is available because

14:07.460 --> 14:08.900
the other is busy.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.740
The last time I went, both were available and I just chose the one who said hi to me

14:12.740 --> 14:15.700
first, but the other one looked sad.

14:15.700 --> 14:16.820
What do I do next time?

14:18.740 --> 14:20.260
Well, there's an obvious answer.

14:21.540 --> 14:22.820
There always is with you.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.460
Well, you need some sort of barber off.

14:26.500 --> 14:32.500
You know that classic scene in Sweeney Todd where they have the shave off and the Sweeney

14:32.500 --> 14:35.620
Todd goes against the flashier guy?

14:35.620 --> 14:39.940
To save the rec center that the big bank is trying to close down?

14:39.940 --> 14:43.780
Yeah, you know that scene in Sweeney Todd where Old Man Carrothers is trying to shut

14:43.780 --> 14:47.380
down the rec center and Sweeney Todd is like, not today, come on teens.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.980
And Sweeney Todd and all the other teens get together to save the rec center and they have

14:50.980 --> 14:51.940
the shave off.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.700
Yeah, I remember that.

14:53.700 --> 14:58.340
And if I remember correctly, there was a little bit of comedic nudity in that scene.

14:58.340 --> 14:58.820
Little bit.

14:58.820 --> 15:01.300
That's a light tasteful comedic nudity.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.660
You know what I would do next time is just get all the barbers.

15:04.660 --> 15:09.860
Tell them you'll pay an exorbitant tip and get all the barbers in the place to work on

15:09.860 --> 15:12.340
you at once and pretend you're in like a montage.

15:12.340 --> 15:17.700
Like a She's All That style or like a Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, you know, upon their

15:17.700 --> 15:18.820
arrival to the Emerald City.

15:18.820 --> 15:19.620
That kind of vibe.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.460
Yeah, that one.

15:25.460 --> 15:26.020
That's the one.

15:27.060 --> 15:32.340
Could we get them to do sort of pay all the barbers to cut each other's hair in like a

15:32.340 --> 15:37.620
circle and then you just look at who's got the best do out of that whole thing.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.820
And then you have them.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.180
Well, you have the person immediately.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.380
But well, shit, that's the problem.

15:41.380 --> 15:44.340
And and because you'd be like, oh, man, Michael, it's you.

15:44.340 --> 15:45.540
You've got the best haircut.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.900
Oh, wait, who did you?

15:46.900 --> 15:49.060
And a few of the boys are going to raise their hands.

15:49.060 --> 15:53.140
And it's like one of y'all's lying more than one of y'all's lying.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.220
Only one of y'all really cut Michael's hair.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.220
We're going to have to cut Michael into three pieces.

15:57.220 --> 15:58.340
Wisdom of Solomon.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.740
Is this how is this not a reality show?

16:00.740 --> 16:02.740
Or like America's Next Top Barber?

16:02.740 --> 16:03.940
How is this not a thing?

16:04.500 --> 16:08.500
Guarantee 100% it definitely, definitely, definitely is right.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.100
This has to be a thing.

16:10.100 --> 16:14.180
I really like the idea of a barber being sad that you didn't pick them.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.100
Like, oh, I wanted to cut his hair.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.420
I wanted to work for 30 minutes.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.580
We call it Barber, Barber, Barber.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.300
Uh huh.

16:21.300 --> 16:26.980
And the host would be Barbara Bush and Tiki Barber, who I think is a football player.

16:26.980 --> 16:30.580
That is a fucking dynamic, dynamic duo.

16:30.580 --> 16:34.420
Um, guys, sheer, sheer genius.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.020
Ah, there it is.

16:36.020 --> 16:36.740
Sheer genius.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.020
Fuck that.

16:38.020 --> 16:44.180
TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, TM, the Bravo Network.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.180
Oh, I thought you just came up with that whole clause.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.060
I thought that was a Justin McElroy Ridge.

16:51.060 --> 16:51.220
Yeah.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.860
I wish I could cold scope something like that out of nowhere.

16:53.860 --> 16:56.980
No, it's like an exist, an extent Bravo property.

16:56.980 --> 17:03.300
Um, hey, I, how did you all pick your hair person?

17:03.300 --> 17:07.940
I went to Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher and I said, who cuts your hair?

17:07.940 --> 17:10.980
Yeah, that's exactly, that's exactly the right answer, Travis.

17:10.980 --> 17:13.700
There's many answers and a lot of them are kind of right.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.020
That's the only undeniably right answer.

17:16.020 --> 17:23.380
And the fun thing is now my barber pony at Folklore Salon here in Los Angeles has a Cameron

17:23.380 --> 17:26.500
Esposito and Rhea Butcher calendar, like promotional calendar.

17:26.500 --> 17:31.140
So every time I get my hair cut, like I'm just like staring at Rhea Butcher like, yep,

17:31.140 --> 17:32.260
that's why I'm here.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.060
You did great.

17:33.060 --> 17:33.540
Great job.

17:34.660 --> 17:41.540
I, uh, I have, usually I'll go to my man, Sonny at Fantastic Sam's, uh, or sorry, my

17:41.540 --> 17:44.660
man, Sonny at Master Cuts up at the mall, but a lot of times I don't have time to go

17:44.660 --> 17:45.300
to the mall.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.820
So I'll go to Fantastic Sam's, which is really a fucking wild west of hair cutting.

17:48.820 --> 17:52.260
I'll just walk in and like throw my arms open.

17:52.260 --> 17:55.300
Like I'm Scott Stab and just be like, who wants, who wants to take it on?

17:55.300 --> 17:56.980
Who wants to ride the tornado with me?

17:56.980 --> 17:58.500
And everybody just rushes.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.420
They pile on each other to get to you.

18:00.420 --> 18:03.140
They want to get their hands in this beautiful, lustrous mane.

18:03.780 --> 18:04.980
I'm actually planning.

18:04.980 --> 18:08.340
Now that's been Sunkissed, can you imagine when I go in there, the fucking stand there,

18:08.340 --> 18:11.620
I'm going to have to call the HPD ahead of time to give them like a heads up.

18:12.340 --> 18:15.700
Or it's going to be like that scene from 300 where everyone's just piling on top of

18:15.700 --> 18:17.380
each other to form a human shield.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.660
Is that a thing that happens in that movie?

18:19.620 --> 18:20.180
Probably.

18:20.180 --> 18:25.380
You could have these two barbers each cut one half of your head and then look at yourself

18:25.380 --> 18:31.620
in the mirror and say, I look ridiculous, but and then you leave and then you become

18:31.620 --> 18:33.940
Riff Raff, the rapper man, Riff Raff.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.100
You become the new Riff Raff.

18:36.100 --> 18:41.860
I'm so terrified of now at almost 33 years old having to find yet another new barber

18:41.860 --> 18:46.740
when I move back to Cincinnati that as part of my like move, I'm already planning to

18:46.740 --> 18:50.260
fly back to Los Angeles whenever I can to do like work stuff.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.940
And I think I'll just schedule all my haircuts while I'm here so that way I can just keep

18:53.940 --> 18:55.620
getting my haircut in Los Angeles.

18:55.620 --> 18:59.540
And even as I say that, it sounds like the bougiest thing I've ever said.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.500
Yeah, it's really rough.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.500
I saw that coming early, you know, like as you launched into it, I thought, oh, this

19:04.500 --> 19:05.620
is going to be pretty bougie.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.700
This is going to be a really bougie thing to say.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.500
Yep, I'm traveling to Los Angeles to get my haircut.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.020
Are you guys using pop filters?

19:12.020 --> 19:14.580
Because when you say douchey, it sounds like you're saying something else.

19:14.580 --> 19:20.260
How about another question?

19:20.260 --> 19:25.860
I live in a building with several other apartments and is this from an apartment?

19:25.860 --> 19:30.500
I live in a building with several other apartments and my neighbors are constantly putting their

19:30.500 --> 19:32.340
own junk mail in my mailbox.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.460
Fucking sap.

19:36.180 --> 19:38.260
Is there a good way to get them to stop?

19:38.260 --> 19:40.660
That's from Nate in New Hampshire.

19:40.660 --> 19:41.700
Everybody okay.

19:41.700 --> 19:45.380
You know who would like this information on moving boxes?

19:45.380 --> 19:47.220
Nate would like information on boxes.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.340
Here you go, Nate.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.380
Yeah, fuck Nate.

19:50.260 --> 19:51.060
That's the question, right?

19:51.060 --> 19:52.820
That's the real question behind the question.

19:52.820 --> 19:57.700
The sub question, the sewer system of this question that allows this question to operate.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.780
What'd you do, Nate?

20:01.780 --> 20:05.780
What Nate doesn't tell you is when he has a full bag of trash, he just throws it in

20:05.780 --> 20:09.780
whatever window is open in his building and just decides he's done with it.

20:09.780 --> 20:10.260
Hey, Nate.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.940
What'd you do, bud?

20:12.740 --> 20:16.020
Cause you did something or else this would not be a coordinated effort.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.140
Yeah, it would be evenly spread out.

20:19.140 --> 20:23.380
But the fact that everybody in the building is like, hey, we can all like, listen, we

20:23.380 --> 20:25.300
call the meeting without Nate here.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.340
We can all agree.

20:26.340 --> 20:27.140
Fuck Nate, right?

20:27.700 --> 20:27.940
Right?

20:27.940 --> 20:28.900
Yeah, yeah, fuck Nate.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.340
No dissenters.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.460
Everyone's on board.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.020
Okay.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.700
What did you do, Nate?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.060
What'd you do, Nate?

20:35.060 --> 20:36.100
Hey, Nate, what'd you do?

20:37.700 --> 20:38.900
What didn't you do?

20:38.900 --> 20:40.820
Oh, that's another good one.

20:40.820 --> 20:45.060
This might be an omission thing where maybe Chris was rolled around and everybody gave

20:45.060 --> 20:51.700
like $20 to like get a present for the super and you had no idea and you didn't chip in

20:51.700 --> 20:56.100
and everybody had to pay for you and everyone's like, Nate hates everyone, including the super

20:56.100 --> 20:57.540
and the super cried a lot.

20:57.540 --> 21:01.780
Cause you know, he seems tough when he's fixing your pipes, but he's a very gentle soul.

21:01.780 --> 21:06.180
And everyone went, I can't believe that he made super Dave cry because that's what they

21:06.180 --> 21:07.140
call the super.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.020
Oh, man.

21:08.020 --> 21:12.820
And so now everyone's just like, Nate is a cruel Ebenezer Scrooge type and I don't trust

21:12.820 --> 21:13.300
him.

21:13.300 --> 21:13.540
Yeah.

21:13.540 --> 21:17.140
And then, and then after Christmas, New Year's Day rolled around and he took the decorations

21:17.140 --> 21:20.100
off his Christmas tree and he just left it in the stairwell.

21:20.100 --> 21:20.900
That's another thing.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.580
Also that, and it caught fire.

21:23.620 --> 21:26.180
Yeah, it caught fire and a whole building burned down.

21:26.180 --> 21:26.820
Stupid Nate.

21:26.820 --> 21:33.700
Nate, I'd like to introduce you to a man named, his name is Burke Plimpton.

21:33.700 --> 21:39.300
And he lives in your, he lives in your building now and there's two sort of defining characteristics.

21:39.300 --> 21:44.020
He's got a big pair of glasses, big nerdy glasses and a big bushy beard.

21:44.580 --> 21:46.980
And he's got the mailbox directly under yours.

21:47.540 --> 21:51.140
And also one more thing you should know about Burke Plimpton is he's you, Nate.

21:53.540 --> 21:55.220
What a great pull, Harvey.

21:55.220 --> 21:55.780
Wait, hold on.

21:55.780 --> 21:56.980
That thing you did there.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.900
Is this like a fight club thing?

21:58.900 --> 22:06.260
He, it's like a new mailbox thing and then Burke Plimpton is going to, is going to, well,

22:06.260 --> 22:06.660
I don't know.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.700
Maybe Burke Plimpton is going to have to be even more of a villain to get this.

22:10.420 --> 22:14.020
They're not going to deliver Nate's mail to Burke Plimpton is the problem.

22:14.020 --> 22:16.100
Well, not at first.

22:16.100 --> 22:23.060
What if, what if Nate reinvents himself as Burke Plimpton beloved, beloved elderly neighbor

22:23.060 --> 22:27.460
and he's just walk around like, I've made too many snickerdoodles.

22:27.460 --> 22:28.900
Would you like some?

22:28.900 --> 22:33.460
And then like, but it sure smells like dog shit in Nate's apartment.

22:33.460 --> 22:36.020
I never met him, but I hate that fucking.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.420
Yeah, he's got to hate Nate.

22:38.420 --> 22:38.980
Yeah.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.820
I think we can all agree.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.300
Fuck Nate, right?

22:43.300 --> 22:48.020
We're just strangers learning each other's likes and dislikes, but I think I get a pretty

22:48.020 --> 22:50.420
strong fuck Nate vibe from you.

22:50.420 --> 22:51.300
And you know what?

22:51.300 --> 22:52.820
I'm on board with it.

22:52.820 --> 23:01.060
I'm going to stuff all of my advertisements for the local grocer in that sad fucker's

23:01.700 --> 23:02.500
mail slot.

23:04.020 --> 23:09.300
Wait, did Burke Plimpton take Nate's apartment or did he rent a second apartment?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.140
I rent a second one.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.420
I mean the first one.

23:12.420 --> 23:14.100
I mean the first one.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.260
It's my only Burke Plimpton pad.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.780
Damn Burke Plimpton's place is better than my place.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.700
I wish I could just live in Burke Plimpton's place.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.540
I wish I was, but everybody likes Burke Plimpton.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.580
I wish I was Burke.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.860
You are Burke Plimpton.

23:25.860 --> 23:27.460
Sometimes I don't even know.

23:27.460 --> 23:29.540
Sometimes I don't know when he begins and I begin.

23:30.420 --> 23:35.140
You know, when I was masquerading as Burke, I met a really sweet lady named Beulah.

23:35.140 --> 23:39.460
She's 70, so she's just six years younger than me, Burke Plimpton.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.860
I think I could have a real shot of happiness with her.

23:41.860 --> 23:43.940
I think we could have really something really special.

23:43.940 --> 23:45.780
Hey Nate, this is me, your wife.

23:45.780 --> 23:47.060
What are you talking about?

23:47.940 --> 23:51.060
Okay, but that has nothing to do with Burke's life.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.580
You're not Burke's wife.

23:52.580 --> 23:53.780
That's Burke's law, baby.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.620
You can't talk to me about Burke's life.

23:55.620 --> 23:57.140
You don't see a ring on this finger.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.420
That's your right hand.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.180
Yeah, that's where the European.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.060
Yeah, Burke's European.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.500
That's the one he puts it on.

24:02.500 --> 24:06.020
God, Beulah would never do me like this.

24:06.020 --> 24:06.740
Him, Burke.

24:07.460 --> 24:09.300
Burke, not me.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.500
Not Nate, never Nate.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.420
Here's one thing you could do.

24:14.260 --> 24:17.780
Go to your box and after you get your mail for that day,

24:17.780 --> 24:21.460
you put a little jelly on it.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.940
And if you put some jelly on your mailbox,

24:23.940 --> 24:26.420
then the next person who comes to stuff junk mail in there,

24:26.420 --> 24:28.820
they're gonna get a big mitt full of the goopy stuff.

24:29.460 --> 24:34.180
And I think that's gonna be a real down part of their day.

24:34.180 --> 24:37.060
Now, issue with this, Justin, is if the next person-

24:37.060 --> 24:37.620
No issue.

24:38.180 --> 24:41.060
The only issue is that I can see is that if the next person

24:41.060 --> 24:43.060
that comes to put the mail in the slot,

24:43.700 --> 24:46.500
if that person is the mailman and they get a big mitt full

24:46.500 --> 24:49.940
of the goopy stuff, you've just assaulted a federal employee

24:49.940 --> 24:51.860
and that's hard time, bud.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.300
That's a federal felony.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.460
Maybe Nate tried this already

24:55.460 --> 24:56.980
and that's why he gets all the junk mail.

24:56.980 --> 24:57.940
It's not his neighbors.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.140
It's just the mailman like,

24:59.140 --> 25:00.820
huh, fuck Nate, right, everybody?

25:00.820 --> 25:01.540
Hey, everybody.

25:01.540 --> 25:02.980
I think we can all agree.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.620
See you at the Christmas party that Nate's never invited to.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.740
I love this Burke Plimpton guy though.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.140
He gets extra good mail.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.780
He gets all of Nate's checks.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.620
Wait, hold on.

25:15.620 --> 25:18.100
And then you have to kill the mailman to keep it covered up.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.900
No one must know your dirty Burke Plimpton secret.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.460
I would suggest getting a trash can,

25:25.460 --> 25:29.540
put it under your mailbox and label it Nate's new mailbox.

25:29.540 --> 25:31.460
Please don't put junk mail in here.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.260
That's good.

25:32.820 --> 25:33.780
It's really good.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.540
Nate mailbox overflow.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.820
Nate's favorite can.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.580
Please don't steal.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.540
Don't steal.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.980
Don't destroy it.

25:42.980 --> 25:45.140
Don't disgrace with junk.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.580
This is Nate's favorite can.

25:50.420 --> 25:52.260
You can put a picture of your face on there

25:52.260 --> 25:54.980
just so people are really into throwing trash at it.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.980
And also maybe shitting in it.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.260
Yeah, maybe they will shit in it.

25:59.780 --> 26:00.500
Another question.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.540
Yahoo, what do you guys want to do?

26:01.540 --> 26:02.040
Yahoo.

26:02.900 --> 26:03.860
How about this one?

26:03.860 --> 26:06.420
It was sent in by Morgan Davey.

26:06.420 --> 26:06.980
Thank you, Morgan.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.260
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

26:08.260 --> 26:09.860
Another anonymous user.

26:09.860 --> 26:13.780
Fucking stand in your truth, folks.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.060
It's by, I'm going to go down the list.

26:15.780 --> 26:19.700
Kelvin is a respondent to this question.

26:19.700 --> 26:20.820
Let's pretend like they asked it.

26:22.420 --> 26:28.020
Kelvin says, will the dentist be able to tell I smoke weed?

26:29.300 --> 26:31.300
I smoke weed every once in a while.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.420
I'm going to the dental checkup in two days with my mom.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.660
Does dentist know I smoked weed?

26:36.660 --> 26:39.860
Since I am 12, I think if he finds out, he will tell my mom.

26:41.140 --> 26:41.640
Oh, no.

26:44.980 --> 26:47.300
OK, this got more complex about halfway through.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.900
12 is probably too young.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.940
Yeah, 12 is too young for most things.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.060
Yeah, most things.

26:55.060 --> 26:55.780
Most cool things.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.740
So OK, let's establish some of the science.

26:58.740 --> 26:59.140
OK.

26:59.140 --> 26:59.640
Up front.

27:00.420 --> 27:01.380
Does weed?

27:02.100 --> 27:02.740
Yes.

27:02.740 --> 27:03.780
Do you think you can smell like teeth or?

27:03.780 --> 27:06.900
One of the most fun stuff, like the most fun stuff ever.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.420
Teeth are porous, right?

27:09.300 --> 27:09.860
Too porous.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.020
Definitely there's weed smell in there.

27:12.580 --> 27:19.540
But I don't know how confident I, as a dentist, I don't know how confident I would have to be

27:19.540 --> 27:24.980
in that weed tooth smell to look at a 12 year old's mom and say, hey, I think this,

27:24.980 --> 27:27.460
I think this preteens smoking some of the kind.

27:27.460 --> 27:29.540
I think he's been hanging out with the sunshine man.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.220
You know what I mean?

27:31.220 --> 27:32.020
And I think you do.

27:32.020 --> 27:39.940
But if there's one person in this world who knows mouths better than like your dentist

27:39.940 --> 27:43.460
knows your mouth better than like your than your lover.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.580
Yeah, that's for definitely for sure.

27:46.580 --> 27:52.980
Because your dentist is not only like up in it, they're looking so hard at your teeth

27:52.980 --> 27:56.180
and they might even be able to see that you've been smoking weed.

27:56.180 --> 28:00.500
They might just look at your porous ass teeth and be like, there's microscopic weed in here.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.620
Yeah, I see that.

28:01.620 --> 28:04.020
I see little flakes that good of that kind kind.

28:04.820 --> 28:05.540
Have you been smoking?

28:05.540 --> 28:11.220
Oh, Miss, Miss Kelvin, your son has been smoking weed.

28:11.220 --> 28:11.540
What?

28:11.540 --> 28:12.100
Yes.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.700
But the bad news continues.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.380
He's been smoking shitty weed.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.500
It's really bad, bud.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.140
Bad weed.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.260
This is shitty weed.

28:18.260 --> 28:21.460
Have you not talked to your son about good weed versus shitty weed?

28:22.100 --> 28:23.780
Do you want to buy good weed from your dentist?

28:23.780 --> 28:24.900
Because we can make that happen.

28:26.260 --> 28:26.980
Is it possible?

28:26.980 --> 28:28.980
Also, it's just like the teeth are very orange.

28:28.980 --> 28:34.820
It's like this is too many Cheetos for an un-intoxicated 12 year old to consume.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.580
How many crunch wraps did you have?

28:40.180 --> 28:45.060
I don't think the dentist will be confident enough in his diagnosis to bring it up to mom.

28:45.060 --> 28:50.980
I do think, though, that if it was me, like I would work in sneaky ways of hinting to the kid

28:50.980 --> 28:53.620
that I knew because I want this motherfucker to scare.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.300
OK, so how would you do this?

28:55.300 --> 28:59.860
I'd be like, well, we just need to schedule you for a follow up.

28:59.860 --> 29:03.220
Would you be free at 420?

29:06.180 --> 29:08.340
And then the parents would be like, that's not ideal for me

29:08.340 --> 29:12.340
because I would have to pick him up after work and it would conflict.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.740
Yeah, I think Kelvin's probably busy, too.

29:14.740 --> 29:15.620
That's the weed time.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.660
That's the time that all of us get super high as a family.

29:18.660 --> 29:19.380
Oh, OK.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.300
Well, in that case-

29:21.300 --> 29:22.420
All my jokes are ruined.

29:22.420 --> 29:23.220
Thank you, mother.

29:23.220 --> 29:27.940
Yeah, I also think that as a dentist, I doubt that there's a dentist in this world

29:28.500 --> 29:32.580
who, like, if they figured out one of their kid patients was smoking weed,

29:32.580 --> 29:34.820
would not only like want to say something.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.900
I don't think that's a dentist's job at all.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.620
I don't think you take a dentist oath that's like,

29:39.620 --> 29:43.780
and if you figure out that that kid says that, you have to say something.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.860
Like, I don't know that there's a dentist's life who feels obligated.

29:47.860 --> 29:49.380
It's more like, yeah, kids smoke weed.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.100
Well, I'm a dentist.

29:50.100 --> 29:50.980
I don't care.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.460
Like, this doesn't affect me at all.

29:53.460 --> 29:59.380
But if the stink is so overwhelming, that kid just opens up their mouth

29:59.380 --> 30:03.620
and it's just like my first apartment's carpet.

30:03.620 --> 30:07.380
Like, I feel like morally, ethically,

30:09.140 --> 30:13.860
what's the code of do no harm and also narc on your kid patients?

30:14.500 --> 30:16.340
I don't know that dentists have to take that.

30:16.340 --> 30:16.580
No.

30:16.580 --> 30:17.380
The Hippocratic oath.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.820
I don't think they have to do anything.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.260
I think as a dentist-

30:20.260 --> 30:21.620
I have a dentist appointment next week.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.860
I'm going in and I'm being like, did you take the Hippo?

30:23.860 --> 30:27.140
Because I don't want you in my mouth if you're not like prohibited from doing harm

30:27.140 --> 30:29.220
because you could do mad harm in there.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.140
Griffin, I tell you a secret.

30:31.140 --> 30:32.100
I tell you a secret.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.420
They just rent the space.

30:34.420 --> 30:38.020
It comes with the tools and the chairs and the diplomas.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.580
They don't have to worry about anything.

30:40.580 --> 30:43.140
They're all up in there doing as much harm as they want.

30:43.140 --> 30:46.740
Then I'm going into every dentist appointment from now on with a fucking-

30:46.740 --> 30:50.340
with a holy Bible, King James edition.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.460
I'll be like, put your hand on this right now and give me the Hippo

30:53.460 --> 30:56.660
because you're not going to get in my mouth until you give me the Hippo.

30:56.660 --> 30:57.300
I'm going to start doing this-

30:57.300 --> 30:58.980
You should actually be doing that with all doctors.

30:58.980 --> 31:00.020
Yeah, I don't know.

31:00.020 --> 31:00.340
How the fuck do I-

31:00.340 --> 31:01.300
Swear to me.

31:01.300 --> 31:02.900
Swear to me you're not going to kill me.

31:03.860 --> 31:08.500
Like, they save me from the boat accident, but I'm horribly injured

31:08.500 --> 31:10.820
and I'm in the ambulance and I'm like, hold up.

31:10.820 --> 31:13.140
Got a pocket KJV.

31:13.140 --> 31:14.100
Do the Hippo.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.140
No. Sir, you're bleeding a lot.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.220
Do the Hippo.

31:19.220 --> 31:20.420
Do it once.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.660
If you're the kid, just fucking stand in it.

31:22.660 --> 31:23.460
Yes, I did.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.780
I was very stressed about coming to the dentist.

31:25.780 --> 31:27.060
Is that not understandable?

31:27.060 --> 31:30.340
Like, yeah, I was very anxious about this visit.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.140
So, yes, I did.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.180
And also, I listened to the-

31:32.180 --> 31:34.500
Statistically, at this point, if the dentist is like,

31:34.500 --> 31:35.540
did you smoke weed?

31:35.540 --> 31:36.660
Look at him like, did you?

31:37.220 --> 31:39.060
Alright, fair enough.

31:39.060 --> 31:39.540
We're done.

31:39.540 --> 31:48.980
So, I think we should take a quick trip to the money zone.

31:48.980 --> 31:54.660
Tell me how paranoid about the Hippo now.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.580
Do doctors have to do that, like, before they graduate?

31:56.580 --> 31:58.660
Like, they walk on stage to get their diploma and they're like,

31:59.220 --> 32:00.340
all right, here goes.

32:00.340 --> 32:02.820
I solemnly swear to do no harm.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.460
They also have to list off all the doctors before them

32:05.460 --> 32:08.900
that begat what doctors before them all the way back

32:08.900 --> 32:09.540
to the first doctor.

32:09.540 --> 32:10.980
Yeah, it takes a wicked long time.

32:10.980 --> 32:11.300
Yeah.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.620
Yeah, well, whichever one had their white coat.

32:13.620 --> 32:16.020
Yeah, they find out what the name of their white coat is,

32:16.020 --> 32:16.740
and then it goes all the way.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.900
Yeah, they have to take it as part of their, like,

32:20.100 --> 32:21.460
indoctrination ceremony.

32:21.460 --> 32:24.180
Like, when they get there, it's like the-

32:24.180 --> 32:24.660
All right.

32:24.660 --> 32:25.460
The last thing they have to do.

32:25.460 --> 32:27.300
So, they have all done it, theoretically.

32:27.300 --> 32:30.660
All right, but, Dennis, I'm fucking watching y'all.

32:30.660 --> 32:33.940
I want to take a second to talk to you all about Warby Parker.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.860
They support our show, and they're offering

32:35.860 --> 32:39.060
contemporary prescription glasses starting at $95.

32:39.060 --> 32:43.140
Prescription sunglasses start at $175, including lenses.

32:43.140 --> 32:47.220
They make buying glasses online easy, risk-free, and enjoyable.

32:47.780 --> 32:50.020
My wife, Sydney, just needed new glasses,

32:50.020 --> 32:52.100
and we didn't even have, like, a promo or sponsorship

32:52.100 --> 32:53.700
or anything going with them at the moment.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.580
And I said, we got to do Warby Parker.

32:56.580 --> 32:57.140
It's really fun.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.780
You go online, you look through all the different styles,

32:59.780 --> 33:01.940
and then they have this home try-on program

33:01.940 --> 33:04.500
where you order five pairs of glasses,

33:04.500 --> 33:07.460
they ship them to you, you try all the frames on,

33:07.460 --> 33:10.260
and so you actually see what they look like,

33:10.260 --> 33:13.460
and then you buy based on, you know, how they look,

33:13.460 --> 33:14.020
which ones you want.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.060
So, you actually get to give them a shot,

33:15.060 --> 33:16.340
then you ship all the frames back.

33:16.340 --> 33:19.140
Wait, I- Oh, I have- Oh, guys, let me try this on.

33:19.140 --> 33:20.020
Tell me what you think.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.100
And Warby Parker, if you like it, you can keep it.

33:22.740 --> 33:26.340
Your face and Warby Parker glasses, I ship that.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.220
And so do they.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.060
Okay, that's-

33:31.140 --> 33:32.020
Well, hold on.

33:32.020 --> 33:33.140
I think maybe you didn't-

33:33.140 --> 33:34.420
I think maybe let me try it again.

33:34.420 --> 33:36.100
No, no, I'm just going to get through this.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.700
Try all the frames on, get a feel for them,

33:37.700 --> 33:39.220
get feedback from others, and you know what?

33:39.220 --> 33:41.060
They'll actually give you feedback if you tweet at them,

33:42.500 --> 33:43.860
and they'll tell you what they think.

33:44.900 --> 33:46.580
Because ship can have two meanings.

33:47.300 --> 33:47.940
Is that clear?

33:49.220 --> 33:54.500
Go to Warby Parker, that's W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R.com

33:54.500 --> 33:57.540
slash my brother, and start your risk-free

33:57.540 --> 33:59.060
try-on experience today.

33:59.060 --> 34:03.060
That's Warby Parker dot com slash my brother.

34:03.060 --> 34:04.980
I ship that, and so do they.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.580
So it's pretty much anybody that ships anything, huh, Trav?

34:10.580 --> 34:11.860
Well, no, no, listen.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.180
I'm giving it to Warby Parker.

34:15.300 --> 34:18.180
Okay, because the next sponsor also ships things.

34:18.180 --> 34:18.680
Fuck.

34:19.620 --> 34:20.980
I need you on your best behavior.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.380
I'm going to tell you about Blue Apron, though,

34:23.380 --> 34:24.580
because Blue Apron's really great.

34:25.220 --> 34:26.420
We all use it.

34:26.420 --> 34:30.820
They taught me how to cook and cook some really amazing meals,

34:30.820 --> 34:34.500
including this, I don't know if you guys did the Korean chicken noodle dish

34:35.300 --> 34:37.140
with like those big rice noodles.

34:37.140 --> 34:39.540
Holy shit, it was so good.

34:39.540 --> 34:40.500
Oh, you're missing it.

34:40.500 --> 34:44.100
I'm on vacation, I had to give my Blue Apron away.

34:44.100 --> 34:45.300
Oh, dude, it was so good.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.020
Anyway, for less than 10 bucks a meal, Blue Apron delivers

34:48.020 --> 34:50.340
seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

34:50.340 --> 34:51.780
to make delicious home-cooked meals.

34:52.580 --> 34:55.060
I'm talking about stuff like spiced pork burgers with goat cheese

34:55.060 --> 34:56.580
and cucumber corn salad.

34:56.580 --> 34:58.500
Talking about summer vegetable quinoa bowl

34:59.220 --> 35:01.700
with fairy tale eggplants, shishito peppers, and corn.

35:01.700 --> 35:05.460
Talking about chicken tinga tacos with summer squash and tomato salsa.

35:05.460 --> 35:07.460
They're so very, very good.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.940
The ingredients are all, you know, fresh

35:11.140 --> 35:14.740
and they can be flexible depending on what your dietary preferences are.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.340
It's so great.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.020
I adore Blue Apron.

35:18.020 --> 35:20.740
You can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals for free

35:20.740 --> 35:23.700
with free delivery.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.140
Damn it.

35:25.140 --> 35:28.020
By going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.900
You're gonna love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home-cooked meals

35:30.900 --> 35:32.260
with Blue Apron, so don't wait.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.260
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

35:34.260 --> 35:35.700
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.820
I have a, okay, I'm just gonna put this tagline out there for Blue Apron.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.620
Blue Apron, now you're cooking.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.340
This is the new, this is the new jingle.

35:46.340 --> 35:47.220
This is the new jingle.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.580
This is the new service I provide.

35:49.300 --> 35:52.340
Do you want another shot at Warby Parker since that one was so bad?

35:52.340 --> 35:54.500
I'm not specific to them at all.

35:54.500 --> 35:54.820
Yeah.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.020
Oh yeah, okay.

36:01.380 --> 36:04.340
Glasses half full, but half the price.

36:04.340 --> 36:05.460
I was gonna say that.

36:05.460 --> 36:06.100
That's so good.

36:06.100 --> 36:09.460
But the thing, the problem is that makes it sound like they just ship you one lens

36:09.460 --> 36:10.180
and one glasses leg.

36:10.180 --> 36:10.900
Oh, that's right.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.660
See the world through rose colored glasses.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.380
No, that's nothing.

36:17.460 --> 36:20.020
How about just, just see the world is really good.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.300
Oh, that's pretty good.

36:21.300 --> 36:22.500
Yeah, all right.

36:23.620 --> 36:26.500
Because if you don't have the glasses, you probably aren't seeing the world very good.

36:26.500 --> 36:26.740
Yeah.

36:27.860 --> 36:31.620
I got a Jumbotron message here for Anthony and it's from Jason who says,

36:31.620 --> 36:32.900
happy birthday, buddy.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.860
Hope you enjoy a shout out from your favorite brothers.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.900
We seriously got to play some disc golf while the weather beautiful.

36:46.180 --> 36:49.700
There's no, there's no punctuation, which I fucking adore.

36:49.700 --> 36:52.660
I was reading a New York Times article about how the period is over.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.780
And just like pretty soon, we're all just going to communicate and beautiful,

36:55.780 --> 36:58.580
poetic E.E. Cummings-esque run on sentences like this one.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.460
Happy birthday, buddy.

36:59.460 --> 37:01.300
Hope you enjoy a shout out from your favorite brothers.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.900
We seriously got to play some disc golf while the weather beautiful.

37:05.620 --> 37:06.020
Love it.

37:07.300 --> 37:10.900
And celebration of life and sunshine and summer and summer boy.

37:10.900 --> 37:15.780
And Anthony, you do seriously need to play some disc golf while the weather beautiful.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.300
What the fuck are you waiting for?

37:17.300 --> 37:18.260
What the fuck?

37:18.260 --> 37:24.420
Gather ye, gather ye rose buds and six sling-ins while ye may.

37:25.300 --> 37:30.660
Because fall's a-coming and behind that, it's that dastard winter.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.700
Listen, if there's not a disc golf of the afterlife, I ain't going.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.740
That's all I'm saying.

37:34.740 --> 37:35.700
Who's this message for?

37:35.700 --> 37:37.460
It's for Josh and it's from Jill.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.140
Jill says, Josh, it was just your birthday.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.780
Jill wanted us to wish you a happy birthday.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.980
Here's to another year of love, Hamilton and me undies.

37:46.980 --> 37:49.780
That's from your number one lady, Jill.

37:49.780 --> 37:52.660
And Jill says, I'd love for this to be on the May 2nd episode.

37:53.380 --> 37:56.180
Well, Jill, it's important to want things, Jill.

37:56.180 --> 37:57.380
That's what keeps us going.

37:57.380 --> 37:59.940
But just because you didn't get what you wanted this time

37:59.940 --> 38:01.460
doesn't mean you won't all the time.

38:01.460 --> 38:04.900
Now, I do like that Jill says it was just your birthday,

38:04.900 --> 38:08.260
which speaking in the broad expanse of time is very true.

38:09.300 --> 38:14.100
Compared to like, you know, the prehistoric era

38:14.100 --> 38:16.340
and the time it's taken us to get here from there,

38:16.340 --> 38:18.260
this was just a minute ago.

38:18.260 --> 38:21.220
You know, if the entire world was a calendar,

38:21.220 --> 38:23.380
the entirety of time was a calendar,

38:23.380 --> 38:28.660
we would be in the last 30 seconds before New Year's

38:29.220 --> 38:33.380
and we would have just missed your birthday by like,

38:33.380 --> 38:35.380
I don't know, the time it takes to blink.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.860
We'd still be very late though.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.860
Yeah, still would be a long time

38:39.860 --> 38:41.380
because that's just perspective

38:41.380 --> 38:44.180
and not really a scaling or changing of time.

38:44.180 --> 38:46.500
Welcome to Cosmos.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.460
I'm Travis.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.300
Welcome to the dumb Cosmos.

38:49.300 --> 38:50.820
I'm popular idiot, Travis.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.780
Welcome to Cosmos.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.340
Welcome to the Cosmos episode that explains to me

38:56.340 --> 38:57.860
how you missed important things.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.660
Use this anytime you need to justify being a shitty friend.

39:03.940 --> 39:04.900
I'm Hal Loveland.

39:04.900 --> 39:05.860
I'm Danielle Radford.

39:05.860 --> 39:06.820
I am Michael Eagle.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.500
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

39:08.500 --> 39:12.260
Maximum Fun's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

39:12.260 --> 39:15.060
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks, the women's revolution,

39:15.060 --> 39:18.580
Sasha Banks, the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.900
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.820
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.660
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

39:24.660 --> 39:28.100
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.980
New episodes, Thursdays on Maximum Fun

39:30.980 --> 39:33.060
or wherever you get your podcasts.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.820
Oh yeah, dig it.

39:34.820 --> 39:45.300
Tights and Fights podcast, Tights and Fights.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.260
I'm a good boy and I always say my pleases and thank yous.

39:48.260 --> 39:52.180
However, I have never been able to commit to saying thank you.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.140
Seriously.

39:53.140 --> 39:56.100
I always dip my head or say it in a silly voice

39:56.100 --> 39:58.180
and it attracts from the genuine gratefulness

39:58.180 --> 39:59.060
I'm trying to convey.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.900
Brothers, how do you give people the thanks they deserve?

40:02.900 --> 40:05.060
Thank you in advance.

40:05.060 --> 40:07.220
Lots of love, Johnny from England.

40:07.220 --> 40:08.660
I think you read that wrong.

40:08.660 --> 40:09.860
You think you read that wrong, Justin.

40:09.860 --> 40:11.220
I think it should have been like, thank you.

40:11.220 --> 40:12.340
Thank you.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.780
Thank you in advance.

40:17.780 --> 40:18.580
This is better.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.780
It's arguably better than the way that I say thank you.

40:23.060 --> 40:25.380
Which is if somebody like somebody,

40:25.380 --> 40:27.140
one of you two like pretend to hold the door for me.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.260
Okay, I'm doing it.

40:29.140 --> 40:29.620
Okay.

40:29.620 --> 40:31.060
What do I say when I do?

40:31.060 --> 40:32.020
After you.

40:32.020 --> 40:36.180
Yeah, I would just be like, thank you.

40:36.180 --> 40:39.300
Like I just kind of, thanks, thank you.

40:39.860 --> 40:40.980
I just kind of whisper it,

40:40.980 --> 40:42.900
just kind of make the moves with my mouth.

40:42.900 --> 40:43.140
Yeah.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.540
But it doesn't, thank you, thanks.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.700
I'm so sad that I know exactly what you're talking about

40:47.700 --> 40:50.340
and I do the exact like where I just can't,

40:50.340 --> 40:52.020
my mouth wants to make the word,

40:52.020 --> 40:53.380
but like my heart is like,

40:53.380 --> 40:54.980
please don't speak to another human being.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.140
Thank you, thanks.

40:57.140 --> 41:02.660
Yeah.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.940
Are you a parcel tongue?

41:03.940 --> 41:04.660
What are you doing?

41:05.780 --> 41:06.740
Harry Potter.

41:08.260 --> 41:10.740
Thank you for holding that door, Harry Potter.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.580
Yeah, this is a, I mean, this is a problem

41:14.580 --> 41:16.740
I think most people suffer from

41:16.740 --> 41:20.980
because otherwise like, hey, thanks.

41:21.700 --> 41:24.180
Like that's not the right way to do it.

41:24.180 --> 41:26.020
Well, here's what the problem is, right?

41:26.020 --> 41:27.220
What are you saying when you say thank you?

41:27.220 --> 41:29.460
Well, you're saying I'm in your debt.

41:29.460 --> 41:29.940
Yeah.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.380
I'm debted to you now.

41:31.380 --> 41:34.660
I mean, I'm a debtor to you.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.820
That's very hard to admit to someone

41:36.820 --> 41:39.380
because you immediately have to make it up to them.

41:39.380 --> 41:42.100
Maybe instead of saying thank you,

41:42.100 --> 41:45.060
you can immediately say what you're going to do

41:45.060 --> 41:46.340
to counterbalance it.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.740
So you will not have any debt.

41:48.740 --> 41:52.180
Like someone holds open the door for you.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.780
You say, I'm falling into your car

41:53.780 --> 41:54.900
and I'll do the same there.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.540
So that way you'll be like, even.

41:57.540 --> 41:59.540
I'm going to hold the door open for your car.

42:00.100 --> 42:00.740
Let's go.

42:00.740 --> 42:03.540
Or maybe you don't have time

42:03.540 --> 42:06.980
and you just say like, now if you ever need anything,

42:06.980 --> 42:09.860
you call me and you hand them like a business card

42:09.860 --> 42:11.540
with just like your name and phone number.

42:11.540 --> 42:14.340
It's like, if you ever need anything, you call me.

42:14.340 --> 42:17.620
Well, on the business card, it just says thank you.

42:17.620 --> 42:18.500
So that way you've like-

42:18.500 --> 42:19.540
Thank you, I've done it.

42:20.180 --> 42:21.620
You win a better one.

42:21.620 --> 42:23.220
It is, okay, what's better?

42:23.220 --> 42:25.940
Thank you, silly voice.

42:25.940 --> 42:27.620
Or someone holds the door and you just go,

42:27.620 --> 42:29.700
hey, thank you.

42:30.420 --> 42:32.820
No, thank you.

42:34.180 --> 42:37.860
This is why hats were invented.

42:39.380 --> 42:41.380
It's because, it's like cowboys,

42:41.380 --> 42:43.460
they didn't fucking thank any man.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.780
No, they didn't say things out loud.

42:45.780 --> 42:46.020
No.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.180
Cause when you do that, you're distracted

42:48.180 --> 42:49.860
and then they gun you.

42:49.860 --> 42:50.660
Gotcha.

42:50.660 --> 42:51.140
Yeah.

42:51.140 --> 42:54.260
What they would just do is just a little tippity do,

42:54.260 --> 42:55.700
a little tip a canoe.

42:57.300 --> 42:58.900
And then that's all that you need.

42:58.900 --> 42:59.860
And I miss that.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.300
Let me pitch this, Griffin.

43:04.420 --> 43:05.540
You're both heading for the door.

43:05.540 --> 43:06.900
They get there first, they open it.

43:06.900 --> 43:08.660
You kind of arch one eyebrow,

43:08.660 --> 43:10.500
tilt your head to the side and do a slight nod

43:10.500 --> 43:12.420
as if to say, you win this one.

43:13.220 --> 43:13.620
Okay.

43:13.620 --> 43:14.900
Like you just acknowledged like,

43:14.900 --> 43:16.100
I would have held the door for you,

43:16.100 --> 43:17.380
but you got here first.

43:17.380 --> 43:18.020
Well played.

43:18.580 --> 43:20.740
See Travis, when you said raise one eyebrow,

43:20.740 --> 43:22.180
I thought you were kind of going like,

43:22.180 --> 43:23.300
what's your angle?

43:23.300 --> 43:26.340
Hey, what are you trying for right now?

43:26.340 --> 43:29.460
What traps have you laid in this building for me?

43:29.460 --> 43:30.260
No, you go.

43:30.260 --> 43:30.900
Well, hold on.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.740
What if they want you to think

43:32.740 --> 43:34.820
that they want you to go first?

43:34.820 --> 43:35.220
Hold on.

43:36.100 --> 43:38.100
Inside there's really treasure

43:38.100 --> 43:39.620
that they want to get to first.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.020
Damn it.

43:40.980 --> 43:43.220
They're all inside my mind.

43:43.220 --> 43:44.340
That's why you just turn around

43:44.340 --> 43:45.460
and walk away from the door.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.900
So if someone gets to the door

43:46.900 --> 43:47.860
and holds the door open for you,

43:47.860 --> 43:49.380
you just go, no, not today.

43:49.380 --> 43:50.500
And you just walk away.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.620
Well, first you stand there

43:51.620 --> 43:53.300
and you try to read their intent.

43:53.860 --> 43:55.860
It's a psychological,

43:55.860 --> 43:56.980
it's that Yomi,

43:56.980 --> 43:58.580
that psychological warfare.

43:58.580 --> 44:01.380
What are you doing, my opponent?

44:01.940 --> 44:03.300
No, not today.

44:03.300 --> 44:06.580
The only way to win against a true Yomi master

44:06.580 --> 44:08.420
who's playing in the Japanese style

44:08.420 --> 44:09.860
is to just turn and walk away

44:09.860 --> 44:11.620
and leave them to their duties and their business.

44:11.620 --> 44:13.220
Griffin, do you have some kind of pop filter on?

44:13.220 --> 44:14.740
Cause when you said yo-yo master,

44:14.740 --> 44:15.540
it sounded weird.

44:17.140 --> 44:19.140
They might also be a yo-yo master.

44:19.140 --> 44:19.860
Yeah.

44:19.860 --> 44:21.380
Can you start following them around

44:21.380 --> 44:22.820
like they owe you a life debt

44:22.820 --> 44:23.940
and now you're bad to them?

44:24.980 --> 44:26.820
And then eventually word would get around

44:26.820 --> 44:28.740
that like, oh, don't do anything nice for him

44:28.740 --> 44:30.420
cause he considers it a life debt

44:30.420 --> 44:32.660
and then he'll like stock your house

44:32.660 --> 44:34.420
and protect you from intruders and what have you.

44:34.420 --> 44:34.820
That's good.

44:34.820 --> 44:36.580
Cause then you can learn true independence

44:36.580 --> 44:38.340
for once in your life, you know?

44:38.980 --> 44:40.900
Cause the world's not going to give you things.

44:40.900 --> 44:42.100
So people shouldn't give you.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.020
Listen, the world is a cruel place

44:44.020 --> 44:46.100
where people are constantly trying to convince us

44:46.100 --> 44:48.340
that there are no unicorns, right?

44:48.340 --> 44:50.980
And so if everyone keeps holding the door open for you,

44:50.980 --> 44:53.220
you'll never learn to hold the door open for yourself.

44:54.020 --> 44:55.060
That's a good point, Travis.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.340
How do you even open doors?

44:56.340 --> 44:57.140
I don't know.

44:59.140 --> 45:02.100
Each one has a different sort of rule set about it.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.020
And it's like, can we just get,

45:04.020 --> 45:05.540
what's the deal with doors?

45:05.540 --> 45:07.620
Can we not just get together on this one?

45:07.620 --> 45:10.020
Some of them go out, some of them go in.

45:10.020 --> 45:12.500
You push, you pull, who even knows anymore?

45:13.140 --> 45:15.380
I saw a car door went up.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.740
Shut up, stop it.

45:16.740 --> 45:20.020
Roman Mars says that if there's a revolving door

45:20.020 --> 45:22.420
and you use the one next to it that isn't revolving,

45:22.420 --> 45:23.780
then you're a monster.

45:23.780 --> 45:25.620
Cause they're so efficient and great.

45:25.620 --> 45:27.540
Can I ask you a question, Justin?

45:27.540 --> 45:28.740
I've been meaning to ask you this for a while.

45:29.540 --> 45:31.620
Why don't you just go do a podcast with Roman Mars?

45:32.820 --> 45:35.940
If he would have me, I would love to get over there.

45:35.940 --> 45:38.420
I have a lot of good ideas for like,

45:38.420 --> 45:41.780
not like this show, but like his show, like smart stuff.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.420
You know what I mean?

45:42.420 --> 45:43.860
Like real thinkers.

45:43.860 --> 45:45.780
Not like, I can't stress this enough.

45:45.780 --> 45:49.860
Like, not like this show, but like smart,

45:49.860 --> 45:52.260
like erudite podcasting.

45:52.260 --> 45:54.180
That's, I feel like my true calling,

45:54.180 --> 45:56.260
where I really feel like my light's under a bushel.

45:56.260 --> 45:58.580
Justin, do you want to do like a weird backdoor pilot

45:58.580 --> 46:01.220
for smart stuff with Justin and Robin right now?

46:01.220 --> 46:04.260
And just like give us a topic you might discuss on smart stuff?

46:04.260 --> 46:05.300
Yeah, like what's the-

46:05.300 --> 46:06.100
I'll give you an example.

46:06.100 --> 46:09.620
And this would be like co-hosted by me and Roman, okay?

46:09.620 --> 46:11.940
So I'll kind of leave blanks for his part.

46:12.740 --> 46:13.700
I can do Roman.

46:13.700 --> 46:16.100
No, I'm just going to leave blanks for his parts, okay?

46:16.100 --> 46:17.300
You don't even want to hear my Roman?

46:18.180 --> 46:20.340
You can try later, but I'm just going to leave blanks for like-

46:20.340 --> 46:22.180
Hey guys, it's me, Roman Mars.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.380
I'm going to steal your brother.

46:23.380 --> 46:23.780
Got him.

46:23.780 --> 46:24.420
Okay.

46:24.420 --> 46:24.980
That's kind of-

46:24.980 --> 46:27.780
Now you just have to high five.

46:27.780 --> 46:29.140
So it'll go something like,

46:29.140 --> 46:32.500
it's kind of, remember, it's like an erudite kind of smart podcast.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.220
Like yeah, yeah.

46:33.220 --> 46:36.420
Like a podcast where you know the host knows the word erudite.

46:36.420 --> 46:37.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:37.300 --> 46:37.860
That kind of thing.

46:37.860 --> 46:39.780
So here's kind of what it would go like.

46:39.780 --> 46:47.540
Okay, please.

46:47.540 --> 46:48.340
Hello, everybody.

46:48.340 --> 46:49.940
Welcome to Smart Stuff.

46:49.940 --> 46:52.740
I am your host, Justin McElroy.

46:52.740 --> 46:55.380
I'm joined as always today by Roman Mars.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.620
Roman, what smart thing are we discussing today?

46:59.300 --> 47:00.020
Uh-huh.

47:00.020 --> 47:00.580
Oh, I see.

47:05.620 --> 47:06.120
Uh-huh.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.600
Speak on that.

47:12.600 --> 47:13.100
Uh-huh.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.200
Huh.

47:16.200 --> 47:16.680
Now, did it-

47:19.560 --> 47:21.000
Oh, Roman really interrupts you a lot.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.280
Yeah, he's being a real turd.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.400
When's it Justin's time to shine?

47:26.680 --> 47:27.180
Huh.

47:27.640 --> 47:28.140
What?

47:29.000 --> 47:29.500
And then-

47:31.000 --> 47:31.500
Oh.

47:31.500 --> 47:37.420
Well, folks, that's all we have time for on Smart Stuff today.

47:44.620 --> 47:49.980
If someone can get Roman Mars to cut out this bit of the podcast and actually try and fill

47:49.980 --> 47:52.220
in the blanks there, that would be fucking stellar.

47:52.220 --> 47:54.140
So that'll be- but it'll be basically like that.

47:54.140 --> 47:54.860
Yeah, Smart Stuff.

47:54.860 --> 47:56.300
It's like our erudite.

47:56.300 --> 47:56.860
You know what I mean?

47:56.860 --> 47:58.220
Like smart.

47:58.220 --> 48:06.300
Has anyone made a companion podcast called 1% Visible that just fills in the rest of it?

48:07.340 --> 48:07.980
Just think about it.

48:07.980 --> 48:11.100
And it's just like, don't believe a word this guy says.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.140
These are fucking lies.

48:12.140 --> 48:13.100
Look at the sidewalk.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.060
It's just a sidewalk.

48:14.060 --> 48:15.180
Don't worry about it.

48:15.180 --> 48:17.500
It's hosted by Rip Taylor.

48:17.500 --> 48:19.180
It's like, look at all the things you can see.

48:20.460 --> 48:21.420
Buildings are big.

48:22.540 --> 48:24.060
Buildings are so big.

48:24.060 --> 48:26.780
Wait, no, mine was the guy from the B-52s.

48:26.780 --> 48:28.540
I apologize.

48:28.540 --> 48:31.420
I think I got into Fred territory as well there.

48:31.420 --> 48:34.380
And now my favorite recurring bit, chemtrails.

48:40.700 --> 48:44.540
1% Visible would be a very good name for a conspiracy theory podcast.

48:44.540 --> 48:44.780
Yeah.

48:45.740 --> 48:47.020
Look below the iceberg.

48:48.540 --> 48:49.020
It's more iceberg.

48:49.020 --> 48:51.500
You got another one star review on iTunes.

48:51.500 --> 48:52.780
Thanks, Rothschilds.

48:52.780 --> 48:58.700
Rothschilds, on to you.

48:58.700 --> 48:59.740
How about another Yahoo?

49:01.740 --> 49:03.020
Yeah, let's do a quickie.

49:04.220 --> 49:05.660
This one was sent in by Julie Kim.

49:05.660 --> 49:06.220
Thank you, Julie.

49:06.220 --> 49:07.500
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

49:08.300 --> 49:09.500
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

49:09.500 --> 49:10.220
No, I refuse.

49:10.220 --> 49:11.260
I'm going to refreshing.

49:11.260 --> 49:16.620
No, it's asked by Parbamall.

49:18.060 --> 49:21.020
It's a medicine I take for my neck.

49:21.020 --> 49:23.100
It's mostly larbamol.

49:23.100 --> 49:27.900
Yeah, Parbamall asks, how do I get back into the zoo?

49:31.820 --> 49:33.580
He's just passing by and asking you.

49:33.580 --> 49:35.100
He left the zoo accidentally.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.300
A funny story.

49:36.300 --> 49:38.300
I was at the zoo, saw some turtles.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.100
They were doing it.

49:39.740 --> 49:41.820
I looked around to see if there were any kids around.

49:41.820 --> 49:45.020
And when I saw none, I jokingly made some hip thrusting motions

49:45.020 --> 49:46.220
about three or four times.

49:48.940 --> 49:50.220
My friends thought it was funny.

49:50.220 --> 49:51.340
You had to be there, OK?

49:52.060 --> 49:52.780
No, I didn't.

49:52.780 --> 49:54.140
That's funny right now.

49:54.140 --> 49:54.700
That's good for me.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.540
No, you are painting me quite the word picture.

49:57.340 --> 50:00.780
Well, some security guard didn't and threw me and my friends out.

50:00.780 --> 50:03.020
Said not to come back for three months.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.620
Thought it was a bit of an overreaction.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.140
Should I just wait the three months out

50:06.140 --> 50:07.820
or actually go back and say something?

50:10.460 --> 50:11.340
There's a lot of good stuff here.

50:11.340 --> 50:14.780
There's no way that's true.

50:14.780 --> 50:15.740
Not to the degree.

50:15.740 --> 50:19.020
This is like, I think if we could push Parbam here,

50:19.020 --> 50:21.100
I feel like Parbam would be like, OK,

50:21.100 --> 50:25.500
when I said three or four times, maybe I meant like 40 or 50.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.020
Like, it was continuous.

50:27.020 --> 50:29.100
And I humped the security guard himself.

50:29.100 --> 50:32.620
It might have been a half hour of sustained humping motions.

50:32.620 --> 50:36.140
And like, there might have been a lot of kids around.

50:36.780 --> 50:40.380
Yeah, and also I was making like Jack Black sex hand motions.

50:40.380 --> 50:41.340
Like, you know the ones.

50:41.340 --> 50:43.580
And maybe I climbed into the enclosure

50:43.580 --> 50:45.420
and was doing it behind the turtles.

50:45.980 --> 50:46.700
With my dick out.

50:46.700 --> 50:48.060
With my dick out.

50:48.060 --> 50:48.860
Inside, inside.

50:48.860 --> 50:50.540
And maybe like a knife in my hand.

50:52.220 --> 50:54.380
The greatest fiction of this question

50:54.380 --> 50:57.740
is that the sort of person who would make

50:58.300 --> 51:01.660
suggestive hip thrusting motions at turtles having sex

51:01.660 --> 51:03.820
could also simultaneously be the sort of person

51:03.820 --> 51:06.380
that checks to make sure they're not children around

51:06.380 --> 51:07.420
before performing it.

51:07.420 --> 51:09.900
I want to make this hilarious ball and ball.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.180
Yeah, hmm.

51:11.180 --> 51:17.020
Any kids around that want to appreciate my hip sensibilities?

51:17.020 --> 51:21.740
These adult themes I'm about to joke about?

51:21.740 --> 51:22.140
No?

51:22.140 --> 51:23.500
Well, here I go.

51:24.300 --> 51:26.620
The character I like even more in this story

51:26.620 --> 51:28.540
is the security guard who says,

51:28.540 --> 51:30.620
well, looks like you're on a time out

51:30.620 --> 51:33.660
till you can learn not to make sex motions.

51:33.660 --> 51:34.380
Three months.

51:34.380 --> 51:37.340
So November 15th.

51:37.340 --> 51:40.380
I don't want to see you around here till November 15th.

51:40.380 --> 51:41.580
And then you can come back.

51:41.580 --> 51:42.780
Who's this person who's like,

51:42.780 --> 51:46.700
I want to go to the zoo more frequently than every three months.

51:46.700 --> 51:48.300
Well, now it's a thing.

51:48.300 --> 51:50.220
Like when the zoo's there every day

51:50.220 --> 51:51.980
and you can go anytime you never want to.

51:51.980 --> 51:54.220
But as soon as someone says, no, you can't,

51:54.220 --> 51:55.980
that's when you want to go to the zoo.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.220
Yeah, you want to bang out those quarterlies,

51:58.220 --> 51:59.180
but now you can't.

51:59.180 --> 51:59.900
I mean, think about it.

51:59.900 --> 52:02.140
He's going to miss the birth of that baby turtle.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.580
That's what he wants to get back for.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.500
The live birth of the baby turtle.

52:05.500 --> 52:08.620
The live staged birth of the baby turtle

52:08.620 --> 52:10.780
and all the pyrotechnics that encompasses.

52:10.780 --> 52:13.100
Of this mistake and a half shell.

52:14.700 --> 52:15.580
What in what?

52:15.580 --> 52:18.860
Okay, one, I don't think those are

52:18.860 --> 52:21.020
within the powers of security guards.

52:21.020 --> 52:22.460
I don't think they could just hand.

52:22.460 --> 52:24.060
I mean, they can say it,

52:24.060 --> 52:25.740
but like, I don't think security guards

52:25.740 --> 52:27.580
just hand out bans like that.

52:27.580 --> 52:29.100
There's not a master list.

52:29.980 --> 52:32.780
Is there a zoo president who's like,

52:32.780 --> 52:34.780
no more, not for three months.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.540
I saw your dirty deed.

52:36.540 --> 52:38.060
So decreed.

52:38.060 --> 52:41.100
That's, I mean, that's fair.

52:41.100 --> 52:42.220
That's a good point, I guess.

52:42.220 --> 52:44.060
If anybody could ban you from the zoo.

52:46.060 --> 52:47.020
Here's the thing.

52:47.020 --> 52:49.900
I went to the Cincinnati Zoo about a month ago.

52:49.900 --> 52:51.660
I'm pretty sure not a fucker who was there

52:51.660 --> 52:53.100
that they could tell you my name.

52:53.100 --> 52:55.900
Like I wasn't like introducing myself to anybody, right?

52:55.900 --> 52:58.220
They're not checking IDs to bust you.

52:58.220 --> 52:59.820
Just go back to the zoo.

52:59.820 --> 53:00.620
How many, okay.

53:00.620 --> 53:04.380
What zoo has this comedian attended

53:04.380 --> 53:06.540
that has enough security guides?

53:06.540 --> 53:10.060
There's a security guard watching the turtle enclosure.

53:10.860 --> 53:12.380
What are you gonna do over there?

53:12.380 --> 53:14.220
Maybe this is a recurring problem.

53:14.220 --> 53:15.180
He just had enough.

53:15.180 --> 53:17.420
Listen, we know those two turtles like to fuck.

53:17.420 --> 53:17.980
We get it.

53:18.860 --> 53:20.380
The turtles fuck all the time.

53:20.380 --> 53:21.100
We get it.

53:21.100 --> 53:23.500
We cannot keep those two turtles apart.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.060
I know.

53:25.100 --> 53:27.260
That's a hard job to hire for, right?

53:27.260 --> 53:29.900
Because like the job duties involve spraying down

53:29.900 --> 53:32.140
these two turtles with a hose when they get too randy

53:32.140 --> 53:33.180
and too loud, man.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.060
Turtles yell.

53:34.060 --> 53:36.700
Problem is you really gotta be careful

53:36.700 --> 53:38.380
because I think there's like a 1% chance

53:38.380 --> 53:41.340
you will hire some sort of reptilian nasty boy

53:41.980 --> 53:43.820
who loves it, who loves this stuff.

53:44.940 --> 53:47.100
The thing is that both the turtles are guys

53:47.100 --> 53:49.020
and the guard is super conservative.

53:49.020 --> 53:51.260
So it's like, yeah, there's nothing funny about this.

53:51.260 --> 53:52.140
What's happening here.

53:52.140 --> 53:53.660
This is an abomination.

53:55.500 --> 54:00.540
You know, I think it is also a huge misjudgment

54:00.540 --> 54:03.340
of human nature that the sort of person

54:03.340 --> 54:05.900
that makes funny turtles having sex.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.220
I can't, I'm trying to be snide about it.

54:08.220 --> 54:11.180
I cannot think about a person doing this and not laugh.

54:11.180 --> 54:12.700
No, it's good stuff, man.

54:12.700 --> 54:13.580
It's funny.

54:13.580 --> 54:17.820
But I don't think that like, I don't think that you can tell

54:17.820 --> 54:21.740
someone like that that they have to change in three months.

54:21.740 --> 54:24.220
I don't think that you could just like tell the sun

54:24.220 --> 54:25.980
not to shine in that sort of sense

54:25.980 --> 54:28.380
and accept the person to like deny their nature.

54:28.380 --> 54:31.980
This guy's the Lenny Bruce of turtle sex hip motions.

54:31.980 --> 54:33.180
You know, he got dragged out.

54:33.180 --> 54:34.220
He's a martyr now.

54:34.220 --> 54:38.060
He's a hero to like everybody who's ever gone to the zoo

54:38.060 --> 54:39.420
and seen animals doing it.

54:39.420 --> 54:42.300
And they wanted to comment, but they know that like

54:42.300 --> 54:45.500
in our puritanical society, we're too uptight

54:45.500 --> 54:48.220
to acknowledge the fact that like, we're all animals.

54:48.220 --> 54:50.220
You know, we all do it, right?

54:50.220 --> 54:53.420
But this one, and I'll say it, hero.

54:54.780 --> 54:58.860
Like he was willing to be the voice

54:58.860 --> 55:01.020
that we all feel we don't have to say like,

55:01.020 --> 55:02.060
doing it's funny.

55:02.060 --> 55:02.700
I get it.

55:02.700 --> 55:03.580
Doing it's great.

55:03.580 --> 55:04.780
Doing it's great.

55:04.780 --> 55:05.260
That's me.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.940
I'm at the zoo just yelling at the turtles.

55:06.940 --> 55:08.140
Doing it's great.

55:08.140 --> 55:10.300
Is it possible you had a look on your face

55:10.300 --> 55:11.980
that made it seem as though you were pretending

55:11.980 --> 55:13.260
that you were up in there?

55:13.260 --> 55:16.620
That you were, it's just like turtle on turtle on you action.

55:16.620 --> 55:18.620
And you're like kind of having a little bit of a fantasy

55:18.620 --> 55:19.580
right there in the middle of the zoo.

55:19.580 --> 55:21.340
Cause I would probably pay somebody for that.

55:21.340 --> 55:21.820
I get it.

55:21.820 --> 55:23.340
If you didn't commit to the joke enough.

55:25.340 --> 55:26.220
Come back for three months.

55:26.220 --> 55:27.980
Cause I'm retiring in two and a half

55:27.980 --> 55:29.500
and I just don't want to deal with this.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.420
I can't handle this again.

55:33.180 --> 55:35.020
Thank you all so much for listening to our program.

55:35.020 --> 55:36.860
We hope you've had enjoyed yourself

55:36.860 --> 55:39.100
and had a pleasant time here in our company.

55:40.780 --> 55:43.020
Thank you for everybody who pre-ordered

55:43.020 --> 55:44.940
our card game monikers.

55:45.660 --> 55:47.020
You should have that in your hot hands

55:47.820 --> 55:48.940
by the holiday season.

55:48.940 --> 55:51.260
So we're really looking forward to that.

55:51.260 --> 55:53.900
Thank you for your support on that front

55:55.180 --> 55:56.860
because it was really, it was great.

55:56.860 --> 55:59.980
I wanted to say over the last like month or so,

55:59.980 --> 56:02.460
basically as I've been preparing to leave

56:02.460 --> 56:04.060
to move back to Cincinnati,

56:04.060 --> 56:06.380
I've been guesting on a lot of podcasts

56:06.380 --> 56:07.500
that everyone should go check out.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.660
I was just on an episode of join Jesse Goh

56:09.660 --> 56:11.420
that was so much fun to record.

56:11.420 --> 56:13.820
Like we all laugh with headaches from laughing so hard

56:13.820 --> 56:14.780
to go check that out.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.740
Did an episode of Alison Rosen is your new best friend

56:17.740 --> 56:18.780
that I had fun doing.

56:19.980 --> 56:23.260
Did the linoleum knife with Alonzo and Dave

56:23.260 --> 56:24.460
where we talked about movies

56:24.460 --> 56:26.700
and I gave my review of Pete's dragon.

56:26.700 --> 56:29.020
Like that just went up yesterday.

56:30.780 --> 56:33.420
Did less than live with Kate Leth

56:33.420 --> 56:35.260
where we talked about like comic books and stuff.

56:36.620 --> 56:37.980
Yeah, I did a whole bunch.

56:37.980 --> 56:40.780
I'll update travismaccroy.com to have a bunch of links

56:40.780 --> 56:43.180
to all the shows I did, but go check that out.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.740
I also wanted one more plug.

56:45.740 --> 56:48.060
We just changed the format of bunker buddies

56:49.660 --> 56:51.580
to make it a lot more like segments

56:51.580 --> 56:55.500
and trying out products and reviewing like survival food

56:55.500 --> 56:58.380
and that plus the interviews with guests

56:58.380 --> 57:00.860
and I'm a huge fan of our new format.

57:00.860 --> 57:02.860
And so if you've never checked out the show

57:02.860 --> 57:04.220
or if you checked it out and you're like,

57:04.220 --> 57:05.820
this is all right, but maybe it's not for me.

57:06.380 --> 57:09.340
I would love it if you could give it another shot

57:09.340 --> 57:11.260
and check it out and see what you think of the new format

57:11.260 --> 57:13.020
and then let me know what you think of it.

57:13.020 --> 57:15.020
You can find all our shows on mccroyshows.com too.

57:15.020 --> 57:17.820
We got a lot of programs that we make for you.

talking about shows like Can I Pet Your Dog

57:26.700 --> 57:30.780
and One Bad Mother and Baby Geniuses

57:30.780 --> 57:32.700
and Stop Podcasting Yourself.

57:32.700 --> 57:34.700
A bunch of good shows up on there.

57:36.060 --> 57:37.900
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:37.900 --> 57:39.420
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

57:39.420 --> 57:40.940
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:40.940 --> 57:41.820
It's a good, good album.

57:43.100 --> 57:46.380
We appreciate them letting us use it for our theme song.

57:46.380 --> 57:48.460
And I wanna thank everybody who sent in questions

57:48.460 --> 57:50.300
for our CISO show that we're making.

57:50.300 --> 57:53.420
We are gonna start making that in September.

57:53.420 --> 57:55.500
We're actually gonna film it and stuff

57:55.500 --> 57:57.340
and do it and make the thing.

57:57.340 --> 57:59.420
And we're so excited about it

57:59.420 --> 58:03.580
and we're gonna have that for you real soon.

58:03.580 --> 58:05.500
And so go get up on CISO.

58:05.500 --> 58:07.500
Oh, Take My Wife just went up on CISO.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.340
That's Cameron and Rhea's show.

58:09.340 --> 58:10.460
It's fucking fantastic.

58:10.460 --> 58:13.100
There's a lot of really, really great stuff on there

58:13.100 --> 58:14.540
that you're really gonna love.

58:14.540 --> 58:16.940
And then we're gonna be on there pretty soon.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.060
So yeah, thanks, thanks for watching.

58:20.060 --> 58:20.860
Thanks CISO.

58:20.860 --> 58:22.300
And thanks everybody who sent in their questions.

58:23.580 --> 58:24.140
Excellent.

58:24.140 --> 58:26.540
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo for us to enjoy?

58:26.540 --> 58:27.820
This one was sent in by Aaron Keys.

58:27.820 --> 58:28.300
Thank you, Aaron.

58:28.300 --> 58:32.380
It's by Yahoo Answers user Houdman.

58:32.380 --> 58:32.860
Perfect.

58:34.460 --> 58:36.300
Houdman asks,

58:37.500 --> 58:39.900
Are old school fedora hats back in style

58:39.900 --> 58:42.860
for the upscale businessman or just for the fringe?

58:45.420 --> 58:46.620
My name is Justin McElroy.

58:46.620 --> 58:48.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:48.140 --> 58:49.180
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:49.180 --> 58:50.380
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

58:50.380 --> 58:51.100

Going into a bullseye interview,

59:16.380 --> 59:19.260
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

59:19.260 --> 59:20.860
but it's an actual conversation.

59:20.860 --> 59:22.140
I don't know where it's headed.

59:24.620 --> 59:27.740
Hey, this is the straight talk that you're gonna get on this show.

59:27.740 --> 59:28.380
Does that make sense?

59:28.940 --> 59:30.220
I feel like I'm in therapy.

59:30.220 --> 59:33.820
I think I got more out of you than the therapist I went to twice.
