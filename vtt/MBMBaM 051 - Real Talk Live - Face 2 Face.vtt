WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:04.920 --> 00:11.080
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.520
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:16.520 --> 00:18.520
cool they are for listening.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
What's up, you cool baby?

00:19.520 --> 00:49.440
Travis is prepping for our live show, which we've, we've subtitled, uh, My Brother, My

00:49.440 --> 00:55.840
Brother and Me, real talk live, face to face.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.840
The number two, otherwise.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.480
Hi, this is My Brother, My Brother and Me, it's an advice show for the modern era, like

01:00.480 --> 01:10.440
Chilean minors emerging from the depths of, uh, no, no, no, no, can we, can we drink in

01:10.440 --> 01:11.440
here?

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
Yeah.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
Yeah.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
Try to stop us.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.440
I can't.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.440
They don't want that on the record.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.440
I'm gonna move Jesse's computer here.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.800
So hi, I'm Justin McElroy.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
I'm your oldest brother.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
Uh, I'm Travis McElroy.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
I'm the middle-est brother.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.240
I'm the youngest brother, and my mic's turned on, which means I win.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.240
What?

01:30.240 --> 01:31.240
Like you, D-Net.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
Am I on?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
Yeah.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
You sound good.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
Speak noisy.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.240
I don't know.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
Fucking killer start.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.240
So here's what we do.

01:38.240 --> 01:43.840
We, uh, we take your questions, uh, and turn them out, coming like into wisdom.

01:43.840 --> 01:48.400
We've asked some of the people who are going to be here tonight to submit questions, uh,

01:48.400 --> 01:51.360
wisdom that they need, uh, delivered unto them.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.920
Uh, we also have some questions from the Yahoo Answers Service, but let's start with, uh,

01:55.920 --> 01:56.920
one of these right now.

01:56.920 --> 01:57.920
First...

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
Before, before we begin.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
Yeah.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Do you guys have any, like, goals or...

02:00.920 --> 02:01.920
Goals you wanna...

02:01.920 --> 02:02.920
Like, any wishes, any hopes and dreams for this?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.920
Just for the live show?

02:04.920 --> 02:05.920
My, my only goal...

02:05.920 --> 02:06.920
Whoa.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.920
I don't care if it's funny or not.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
Um...

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
I mean, I really have their money.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.920
You're really up on that mic.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.920
You're really...

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
Getting a taste, huh?

02:12.920 --> 02:13.920
I gotta eat it.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
Like, more of the taste of chrome.

02:14.920 --> 02:20.320
I can't perform without chrome in my mouth.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.920
My only goal is, I hope, that...

02:22.920 --> 02:23.920
Still.

02:23.920 --> 02:27.920
He hopes you can hear his mustache.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.520
I want you to feel the bristles of my face against your face.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.720
What's it like to kiss Griffin?

02:32.720 --> 02:36.140
This is what it's like.

02:36.140 --> 02:39.000
My only goal...

02:39.000 --> 02:45.400
I've got a new goal to change since we started, but go ahead.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.720
I just don't want my balls to come out of my pants, so...

02:48.720 --> 02:50.520
I don't know how it would happen.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.520
I would shift...

02:51.520 --> 02:53.560
I'm wearing jeans.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.120
It would require some physics.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.120
They'll never know.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
There's like a...

02:57.120 --> 02:58.120
Put some English.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
Your money.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.120
You're good.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
Yeah.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
I actually...

03:02.120 --> 03:03.120
I developed a fear slash goal.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
What's that?

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
And that is...

03:05.120 --> 03:07.960
No one can ever see it, including these guys, because we record in different places, but

03:07.960 --> 03:12.960
when I'm at home, if I'm thinking of a joke, my face goes to this.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
Or like a solid...

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
For the majority of the show?

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
Yeah.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
Like...

03:16.960 --> 03:19.960
For those listening who are downloading the show later, I would liken it to a caveman.

03:19.960 --> 03:20.960
Yeah.

03:20.960 --> 03:21.960
I call it dead face.

03:21.960 --> 03:22.960
Okay.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
Because it's like...

03:23.960 --> 03:24.960
Yeah.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.920
And then I come back with a joke, and I need to not do that in front of all you guys.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.200
That's a preview for Travis' Wake.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.320
That's that gallows humor.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.360
I would just like to not be super racist.

03:38.360 --> 03:44.760
Like if I dip my toe into some mild racism, that would be fine.

03:44.760 --> 03:49.360
I edit every podcast, and in every episode, sure enough, there's one tiny little tidbit.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.920
Usually, you have to look to find it.

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
Like where's Waldo?

03:51.920 --> 03:55.000
Only instead of Waldo, it's like a racist question.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.200
We usually record like three hours of material, and then put out an hour-long show.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.760
I express this fear to my wife, who's here.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.760
Is she here?

04:02.760 --> 04:03.760
Is she somewhere?

04:03.760 --> 04:04.760
Hey.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
Hey, everybody.

04:05.760 --> 04:13.800
It's my wife, Sydney, and my dad, Clint, our dad, shared dad, our co-dad, Clint.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.480
I express this fear to my wife.

04:16.480 --> 04:21.520
She called it pulling a Kramer, which if my career can be summed up that way...

04:21.520 --> 04:24.280
This is our first live show, which is not the best time to pull a Kramer.

04:24.280 --> 04:27.080
You don't want to pull a Kramer.

04:27.080 --> 04:32.920
Because this is our first live show, I want to take a second to apologize for the fact...

04:32.920 --> 04:33.920
I don't hear myself.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
Is it really that loud?

04:34.920 --> 04:35.920
No, you're still good.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.920
I need more monitor burning.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.920
I want to apologize, because this is what we look like.

04:39.920 --> 04:40.920
Sorry, everybody.

04:40.920 --> 04:47.000
I feel like we adopted some handsome radio voices from our father, who's a radio professional,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
but...

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
This is it.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Oh, you're getting...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Where's Eric?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Is Eric here?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Eric?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Can you raise your hand?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Eric from Chicago.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Good one, Eric.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Way to narrow it down, Eric.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.960
Well, Eric asked us a question about paintball.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.440
He said, at my corporate job, there was recently a call for suggestions for team-building activities.

05:05.440 --> 05:09.840
I propose paintball since it's a team game and can use the products we make, radios,

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
while playing.

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
The boss really liked it.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.840
We're going to do it this summer.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
Here's where I need advice.

05:13.840 --> 05:17.880
I actually proposed this idea because it would give me free reign to shoot my coworkers in

05:17.880 --> 05:22.880
the dick with paintballs, potentially consequence-free.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.760
Would it be uncouth to go on a dick-shooting rampage at a corporate team-building event,

05:27.760 --> 05:31.760
or should I go ahead with my plan of dick destruction because, hey, it's part of the

05:31.760 --> 05:32.760
game?

05:32.760 --> 05:33.760
Eric?

05:33.760 --> 05:37.120
Eric, first off, I think you have some misconceptions about paintball.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.720
I haven't played paintball in a while, but I don't remember it being just like a campaign

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
for impotence.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.720
And what's all this pent-up dick rage?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.600
You really are angry at your coworkers' dicks.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.360
There's a lot of places you can shoot with a paintball gun on a person's body that's

05:51.360 --> 05:52.360
going to hurt.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.840
You don't have to aim straight for the dick.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.040
Yeah, not right for the dick.

05:55.040 --> 05:59.720
I think you can probably, Eric, we can give you permission to do this, but I think that

05:59.720 --> 06:03.000
it's going to come down to a question of fortitude.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.400
If you've got your boss's dick in lacrosse hairs, can you pull the trigger, release the

06:07.400 --> 06:13.560
CO2, and just fucking fire that red spot of, like, I mean, it's insubordination, right?

06:13.560 --> 06:17.080
Yeah, because that's not going to come up in the performance review, but it's going

06:17.080 --> 06:18.080
to be there in the background.

06:18.080 --> 06:24.800
Yeah, like, if the performance review were a play, the backdrop would be a picture of

06:24.800 --> 06:30.000
him, you shooting him in the wiener, like, he's not going to let it slide.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.360
Also, it's not just about can you do it, but can you do it?

06:34.360 --> 06:39.000
Like, do you have the accuracy required to really just get right in there and shoot him

06:39.000 --> 06:44.320
square in the dick, because, first of all, you're going to need to know the parameters

06:44.320 --> 06:47.080
of said dick, which, good luck acquiring that information.

06:47.080 --> 06:53.400
We're going to need some heavy recon before this paintball game.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.200
He gets his own performance review, like, what are you working with down there?

06:57.200 --> 07:00.440
Eric was really worried about shooting all of us in the dick, but he spent most of the

07:00.440 --> 07:01.440
time just firing at walls.

07:01.440 --> 07:06.680
You could ask the measurements of his dick, because you could tell him that you don't

07:06.680 --> 07:15.800
want to shoot him in the dick, so you need to know which area not to aim for.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.400
Can you paint your dick with some neon green, something just to help me avoid...

07:19.400 --> 07:21.040
Of course, a tiny orange hat on the top.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.040
Don't get it twisted.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.040
Don't get it twisted.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.040
Don't get it twisted, Raphael.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
I'm just going to shoot around...

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
He works at the Ninja Turtles.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
I forgot to...

07:27.040 --> 07:33.720
What I'm saying, if you shoot your boss in, like, the upper thigh or the mom's pubis,

07:33.720 --> 07:36.320
you're going to get in an equal amount of trouble, and you're not going to get that

07:36.320 --> 07:41.120
sweet satisfaction you'll get from a killer dick shot.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.120
You want to feel it.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.120
Griffin, do we have any yahoos?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.120
We have so many yahoos.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
This one we found.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.120
It wasn't sent in by anybody.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
Which is where...

07:47.120 --> 07:48.120
What?

07:48.120 --> 07:49.120
It was actually sent in by...

07:49.120 --> 07:50.120
What now?

07:50.120 --> 07:55.680
We'll still get down there in the dirt with you people and fucking dig around.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.720
We have a basic understanding of how the internet works.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
Yeah.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.120
Google schmoo, I say.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.120
Justin actually found this one.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.120
Is this your first...

08:05.120 --> 08:06.120
It's a treasure trove.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.120
You never really...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.120
You don't have to be like that.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.120
It doesn't have to be like that.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.120
No, I'm saying...

08:10.120 --> 08:13.760
In case anyone doesn't know, Justin contributes nothing until this moment.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
So like this.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
Here it is.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.760
Ready?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.560
And I turn it on, and they get, like, 50 minutes, and then off.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.600
I don't even remember the show exists.

08:21.600 --> 08:28.520
This question was asked by Carly, who asks, where can I hire an elf impersonator for my

08:28.520 --> 08:32.640
b-day party?

08:32.640 --> 08:39.160
I am going all out this year and throwing myself a b-day party.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.160
I'm an elf fanatic.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
I think we could have assumed...

08:41.160 --> 08:42.160
Yeah.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.160
I'm cool on elf.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.160
I'm a minor elf enthusiast.

08:44.160 --> 08:53.400
I bought my three friends three gifts to give me.

08:53.400 --> 08:59.400
An elf lunchbox, an elf alarm clock, and an elf rock star action figure with guitar and

08:59.400 --> 09:01.240
posable arms.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.280
Let it sink in, okay?

09:03.280 --> 09:04.280
Let it sink in.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.360
All I need is an elf impersonator.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
Where can I find this?

09:07.360 --> 09:16.360
I would say, first and foremost, you need a few more things than just an elf impersonator.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.240
I can think of 25 things off the top of my head that you need before you need an elf

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
impersonator.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.400
I'm going to throw out this person has three friends.

09:25.400 --> 09:32.280
Who apparently does not understand her penchant for elf.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.440
They couldn't think, like, what's Carly all about?

09:34.440 --> 09:36.220
Alf, I think.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.800
That's maybe what you should base your gifts on.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.280
So tell me about this birthday party you're taking me to, Danny.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.680
Yeah, it's going to be cool.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.520
The guy's really nice.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.080
There's this one thing.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.840
Just a heads up.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.840
Just a heads up.

09:50.840 --> 09:57.040
If someone brings up Gordon Shumway, just roll with it.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
He's a fan.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.040
Welcome to Melmac.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.440
We are not being particularly helpful.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.440
You're right.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.160
Where can they find an elf impersonator?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.200
What's the number one?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.280
Is there an accepted answer from the Yahoo!

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
Answer service?

10:09.280 --> 10:12.720
Well, I'm reading, I don't know if you can see this, I'm reading off a piece of paper.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.720
I don't have that information.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.600
I remember it because I looked it up, number one answer.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
The Midget Store.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
No, that's it.

10:19.600 --> 10:26.880
No, you guys laugh, but that's an excellent point because if you get an elf that is like

10:26.880 --> 10:32.640
you get eye to eye with an elf, like he's the height of a full grown man, like you will,

10:32.640 --> 10:36.520
that's a terrible, I can't imagine anything scarier than that in my mind than a six foot

10:36.520 --> 10:37.520
tall elf.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.080
You don't think like the whole situation is just terrifying in general?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.360
I think the whole situation is terrifying in general, but for...

10:42.360 --> 10:44.480
No, see I thought this too.

10:44.480 --> 10:48.720
Elf expanded to six feet tall, horrifying, but not as horrifying as that moment when

10:48.720 --> 10:54.960
you reach for the punch and you're like, whoa, elf, right there.

10:54.960 --> 11:00.200
There's a whole emporium of oddly sized like 80s sitcom star impersonators.

11:00.200 --> 11:13.560
Could we make this like a giant Webster, like horrifyingly gigantic wonders.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
With killing power.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.160
She's a robot, but with killing power.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.160
Yeah, she's basically...

11:18.160 --> 11:22.280
She's still cute as a button, but she's nine feet tall.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.280
She's sweet as pie.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.400
Her arm does spin around and become a machine gun.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.400
She's a darling though.

11:27.400 --> 11:32.040
She's fucked up to Skynet, but otherwise a real sweetheart.

11:32.040 --> 11:40.760
I think that if you are a midget, a little person, who does birthday parties...

11:40.760 --> 11:43.040
If you are an elf impersonator, you don't care.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.040
You've got the suit, right?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.760
Like you've got the suit in your house.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.160
There can't be enough of those just rolling around that...

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
Call me what you will.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
I need the money real bad.

11:52.160 --> 11:57.920
Is this guy going to be able to handle meeting elf in person?

11:57.920 --> 11:59.920
Is this guy going to be able to handle the pressure?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.920
I'm like, I couldn't...

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
I am Starstruck.

12:01.920 --> 12:10.280
Oh yeah, let me pause at another question.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.520
Can we just get the real elf?

12:11.520 --> 12:12.520
What's he up to?

12:12.520 --> 12:17.520
What has elf been in since elf?

12:17.520 --> 12:25.680
Oh, fucking stupid elf.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.600
He's got to be doing something, right?

12:27.600 --> 12:31.240
Somewhere there's a room you could walk into and there would be elves hanging from the

12:31.240 --> 12:32.240
ceiling.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.240
Deal with that reality.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.320
Let's just like dead-eyed looking right at you.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.280
We were talking about this backstage, actually.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.960
Just rapping about elf.

12:41.960 --> 12:46.640
How fucked up is it that elf's real name is Gordon Shumway?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.720
Do people still call him Alf?

12:48.720 --> 12:52.560
Like he told them his real ass name, right?

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
Like, hi, I'm Gordon.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.560
Oh, Alf.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.960
That's just shorthand bigotry is what that is.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.960
Yeah, Alf is his slave name, basically.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.960
That's what you're saying to me.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.960
I'll edit that out later.

13:04.960 --> 13:05.960
Fuck.

13:05.960 --> 13:06.960
Fuck.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.280
You know, a lot of people don't know this.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.280
LeVar Burton played elf.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.280
That's true.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
That's true.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.280
That's true.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.280
You laugh.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.280
It's true.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.280
Your accent is fascinating.

13:17.280 --> 13:25.720
Not just a blind man, also an extraterrestrial with a real taste for kiddies.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.720
I am...

13:26.720 --> 13:27.720
Is Jacque here?

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
Jacque?

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
Hi, Jacque.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.720
Jacque.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
Jacque.

13:31.720 --> 13:38.840
Jacque asks us I'm writing on behalf of my BFF Ally B. Her boyfriend feels really uncomfortable

13:38.840 --> 13:40.560
in neckties and bowties.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.240
He doesn't like to wear them but still wants to look classy when attending dress-up style

13:44.240 --> 13:50.720
events such as weddings or charity balls what are some great tie alternatives

13:50.720 --> 13:54.520
that's from Jacqueline you picked it of the two podcasts that are performing

13:54.520 --> 13:59.000
tonight you picked the best one I think yeah who you go to fashion advice the

13:59.000 --> 14:02.720
guys who all showed up with the exact same jacket had to switch last minute

14:02.720 --> 14:07.880
Travis check it off no yeah Travis took his jacket off real tall. I think we can all agree, all agree.

14:07.880 --> 14:17.400
Ebola tie. Are you an up-and-coming oil magnate? I think if I see a guy in Ebola tie I know it's

14:17.400 --> 14:22.600
time to party like yeah if that guy makes that bolo tie choice shit might go

14:22.600 --> 14:27.320
down shit might not go down I want to be with that guy yeah what is what is the

14:27.320 --> 14:34.400
utility of Ebola tie what is it what is it holding together? It's like an ID badge it's like saying I'm the Swiss army knife of people

14:34.400 --> 14:40.800
no matter what circumstance comes up I got it. You need clothing accessories with

14:40.800 --> 14:46.280
real cow skulls on them I'm your guy. I think a great alternative is just the

14:46.280 --> 14:50.640
open top button. You think? Yeah because that says like I'm not gonna constrain your

14:50.640 --> 14:55.340
rules I'm not gonna follow whatever laws you set forth before. I go with the

14:55.340 --> 14:59.280
office party look where it's I was wearing a tie it might have been up

14:59.280 --> 15:08.360
later but right now I'm down it's margarita let's do this. What about pet

15:08.360 --> 15:17.560
snake? What if it was a corn snake that you turned into Ebola tie? I would wear

15:17.560 --> 15:23.080
that I would sport that look. Griffey got any more yahoos? Sure. I know you do. I saw

15:23.080 --> 15:28.560
the list. I do. This one was sent in by Jacob Locker. Is he here? I don't think he

15:28.560 --> 15:32.520
is. He's the greatest. He's the greatest person. Thank you Jacob Locker it's by

15:32.520 --> 15:39.160
yahoo answers user Megan Curtis who asks perplexingly how can I get back at

15:39.160 --> 15:46.040
my mom without putting pizza crust in my butt?

15:46.040 --> 16:02.240
That's the only way I know like that exists. When I'm mad at her I stick pizza

16:02.240 --> 16:10.040
crust in my butt so she'll have to take me to the hospital. How many times could

16:10.040 --> 16:16.040
that be effective? Once maybe twice and then it's like you got this. How can I

16:16.040 --> 16:20.840
get back at her without having to do this? Megan Curtis. Do you think after like three

16:20.840 --> 16:27.040
times the mom starts going just start doing heroin? The little boy who

16:27.040 --> 16:33.440
cried there's pizza crust in my ass. I think if your mom has had more than once

16:33.440 --> 16:38.680
scoop you up in her arms like her baby boy take you to the ER and and show you

16:38.680 --> 16:43.240
to the doctor and hold you up like Simba and say yeah you're fucking

16:43.240 --> 16:47.640
gotten back you there's no shit she can do where you're you have not gotten back

16:47.640 --> 16:54.440
in advance at her. You've gotten back as hard as you're gonna get back. Why hasn't the mom stopped buying pizza?

16:57.160 --> 17:05.800
For the very least go with thin crust. God damn it this DiGiorno deal is just so good. You see you see the Papa

17:05.800 --> 17:09.640
John's guy pull up outside and you start running through your mind like what the fuck did I do?

17:09.640 --> 17:14.760
Did we fight? What could he be mad about? I gave him back his Akon tape I don't

17:14.760 --> 17:21.600
know what his problem is. I let him listen to Beastie Boys at all hours. Like of all the

17:21.600 --> 17:25.240
ways to inconvenience your parents to teach them a lesson I think making them

17:25.240 --> 17:28.280
take you to the hospital I think is one of the worst ways to do it especially

17:28.280 --> 17:33.320
when the toll to do so is sticking. If anyone listening to this right now is

17:33.320 --> 17:42.000
considering this mode of getting back your parents. A. Kill yourself. B. Your parents might react

17:42.000 --> 17:45.840
strongly in the moment then they're gonna have a glass of wine later and

17:45.840 --> 17:53.560
look at each other and go what did we do? Our son's a pizza file freak. And then

17:53.560 --> 17:58.680
they're gonna giggle. I giggle. Hey and by the way pizza guy like we get it we

17:58.680 --> 18:04.160
know what's up. You're not mad at your mom. You like to put some pizza crust.

18:04.160 --> 18:10.040
The sexiest of all the Italian foods. Talk about stuff trust.

18:10.040 --> 18:16.840
We were all thinking. Thank you. The voice of the people.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.640
That was good. I do that when no one can see. That's all I had written down.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.760
We're down for pizza crust riffing if you want to move on. Is that all the pizza

18:31.760 --> 18:39.040
is all the pizza crust gags? Those are all our notes. Is a musically minded in the

18:39.040 --> 18:44.960
Midwest here? Musically minded in the Midwest? Hey hey right there. That's a weird name.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.600
That's a weird name. I bet I bet after you got that name you put some pizza

18:48.600 --> 18:52.960
crust in your butt. I meant it. How do my wife and I convince our eight-year-old

18:52.960 --> 18:57.520
son that piano lessons are awesome and not nerdy? When we told him we want to

18:57.520 --> 19:01.320
take him to take piano lessons he told us he only knows one kid that takes

19:01.320 --> 19:06.960
piano lessons and that they are a huge liability to his reputation.

19:06.960 --> 19:11.840
Grew up so fast. We want him to inherit the same love of music that our parents

19:11.840 --> 19:17.480
gave us. Help us brothers. How old is the kid? Eight. Eight years old? How's he supposed to

19:17.480 --> 19:22.840
front in the Pokemon League? How's your rep? What's your rep like? Like what kind

19:22.840 --> 19:27.080
of rep do you have at age eight? Yeah man he's probably trained three four

19:27.080 --> 19:33.000
years he doesn't give a shit. He does I mean he does but it's in the potty.

19:34.360 --> 19:41.080
There's a lot of really fuck like you show all the manly poonhound pianists

19:41.080 --> 19:45.240
out there you like your Elton John's your Liberace's give those those role

19:45.240 --> 19:56.360
models there to look look for and or Billy Joel. I could name ten nerdier instruments off the top of my head like if you want to give that kid flugelhorn lessons then he's in

19:56.360 --> 20:02.320
for a world of hurt but I think a piano yeah you can make him take flugelhorn

20:02.320 --> 20:07.880
lessons and then give him the option to do piano. I've been practicing my

20:07.880 --> 20:12.560
theremin for three months I'm ready to switch I think. I just got beat up in the in

20:12.560 --> 20:17.400
the at eight years old. Well on the other hand though if he gets like super

20:17.400 --> 20:21.520
talented and he has playing some tinder jams for for you know ladies once that

20:21.520 --> 20:28.080
becomes a thing or dudes or fellas then the problem is piano and the reason I

20:28.080 --> 20:31.680
switched from piano to guitar not the real reason I did but for the purpose of

20:31.680 --> 20:37.920
this podcast I'll say it is. I can't carry a piano around to play in the quad to try and get trim.

20:37.920 --> 20:45.120
You can but it's massively unpleasant. It's super fucking heavy and so it's it's hard to be on your

20:45.120 --> 20:49.920
game when you're carrying a two-ton baby grand around yeah hey Griffin what are

20:49.920 --> 20:54.360
you doing I'm trying to get some trim uh why why are you that you're so sweaty

20:54.360 --> 21:01.240
and you you have three moving guys with you. That's the problem though. It's expensive but it

21:01.240 --> 21:06.640
works. Have you thought about keytar? It's like all the beauty of a piano but

21:06.640 --> 21:10.560
with the portability of a guitar. Yeah your eight-year-old should be really

21:10.560 --> 21:18.440
into that. Don't listen to Travis. So hopefully that should help Griffin. You

21:18.440 --> 21:24.320
know what I need. I do. Okay here this one was sent in by Kieran D. Thank you

21:24.320 --> 21:31.400
Kieran D. This one was asked by there's a bug get out of here by Jay Jenkins who

21:31.400 --> 21:34.880
asks wait for the radio for people who are listening later there was a bug

21:34.880 --> 21:38.920
there was a bug it was super big and scary. Griffin wasn't riffing like that

21:38.920 --> 21:47.120
was a there was a bug. Jay Jenkins asks I have two urethras any

21:47.120 --> 21:54.080
information? I noticed this a few days ago but when I used the restroom I peed

21:54.080 --> 21:58.960
two different ways and when I pulled my foreskin back I can't say that I don't

21:58.960 --> 22:07.760
gotta cut that out. When I pulled back and looked at the tip I had two

22:07.760 --> 22:13.480
completely separate urethras. How common is this and are there any advantages to

22:13.480 --> 22:23.920
this? The worst superpower ever. The only thing I can think of is bitching parlor

22:23.920 --> 22:32.680
trick. There are two bad guys we must blind at the same time. I mean we all have that

22:32.680 --> 22:35.240
moment where we're at a bar we've had a few drinks we're trying to show off say

22:35.240 --> 22:39.640
hey look at how far back I can be from the urinal and still make how many

22:39.640 --> 22:44.000
urinals you got. Now we can add a whole other element to it where you can add a

22:44.000 --> 22:51.120
trick shot. Somebody hand me a mirror. God you could win some bar bets though you

22:51.120 --> 22:57.880
know I bet I can you know. I bet you only have one urethra. Rock! Pay up sucker.

22:57.880 --> 23:05.600
Check it. Hi my name is Philip Daniels I'm the most in-demand not in-demand

23:05.600 --> 23:13.720
porn star in the world. They call it the funny shot. There it was. What's up dad?

23:13.720 --> 23:19.400
I actually I did write down one of the answers because it was so great it was

23:19.400 --> 23:25.760
by answer one who said you're telling me you never noticed this well two holes

23:25.760 --> 23:33.960
equals two times the fun. Does it equal two times the fun? Does it? I think it equals

23:33.960 --> 23:39.720
two times the explanation. I think like four or five times the explanation since your

23:39.720 --> 23:43.720
explanation is I have a urethra I think you probably need a little bit more than

23:43.720 --> 23:47.040
that. You look like you have an alien tweener can you please give me a little

23:47.040 --> 23:53.400
bit more. Confirm or deny? Hey can you read me the part about when he noticed?

23:53.400 --> 23:59.440
Well he's 17 it sounds like it's a pretty recent. Bullshit. He pulled his force

23:59.440 --> 24:04.800
back and he looked right at the tip like I guess he'd never I never look like

24:04.800 --> 24:12.320
straight on. I've shit. Wait has anyone in this room ever checked? When was the last

24:12.320 --> 24:17.060
the last head count that you did? Raise your raise. When was the last census you

24:17.060 --> 24:23.760
performed? You man got bifocals? Raise raise your hand if you checked for a

24:23.760 --> 24:30.960
double before. We're going with a spread shot. People at home zero hands. Zero hands for the

24:30.960 --> 24:37.840
record as long as we're keeping track. I don't know if you remember being 14 I

24:37.840 --> 24:42.680
would have noticed to your research. Yeah I probably would have noticed. That's the

24:42.680 --> 24:48.080
first time you really. That's the first time you really. You do some Lewis and Clark like an

24:48.080 --> 25:01.120
expedition. Did you say Lois and Clark? That's exactly what I said. The first time you did some serious Terry Clark Dean Cain action.

25:01.120 --> 25:08.800
Boom! Nailed it. Yeah thank you. I think Terry Hatcher was the reason I first

25:08.800 --> 25:14.720
explored my urethra. Yeah I mean probably. Let's get out of here. Give me another one.

25:14.720 --> 25:20.880
Another one? Another Yahoo? Yeah you know what I mean. Alright this one will take us down a pretty dark path.

25:20.880 --> 25:29.000
Cool cool awesome. This one was also sent in by Jacob Locker. It's by Yahoo

25:29.000 --> 25:34.600
Answers user Megan Curtis who asks why are naked babies socially accepted

25:34.600 --> 25:39.640
though other age nudity is not? Really I've seen advertisements of plenty with

25:39.640 --> 25:45.200
naked babies slash toddlers but why not other ages? It seems stupid.

25:47.280 --> 25:56.560
What advertises is she looking at? Yeah that's. Sunscreen, baby lotion. That's it

25:56.560 --> 26:00.960
right? I don't even think we can see this. Full on full frontal baby nudity.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.800
Like a lot of baby nudity. I don't think it exists in the world. What?

26:05.800 --> 26:10.180
Let's presuppose that it does. Let's presuppose we're living in some sort of dark alternate

26:10.180 --> 26:14.680
reality where every ad features baby nudity. You want to buy this car? Check out this baby wiener.

26:14.680 --> 26:20.880
Check out this sweet naked baby. What's that in the passenger seat? It's a baby and he's naked what's up?

26:20.880 --> 26:25.880
Hey do you like frozen yogurt? Do you like frozen yogurt with naked babies in it?

26:25.880 --> 26:31.200
We got you. Don't even worry about it. I've been sitting here while you guys

26:31.200 --> 26:36.280
were talking trying to think of something less sexy than a naked baby. Like you

26:36.280 --> 26:42.200
don't look at a naked baby and go yeah unless like you've got a date with Chris Hanson in the near future.

26:42.200 --> 26:52.200
Yeah I'm just letting you dangle what's up. It's like a baby wiener. It's an aggressive technique yeah absolutely.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.200
I just don't know how far we can go with this naked baby. You got anything else in there?

26:55.200 --> 27:05.200
Fucking bag of tricks? You fucking psycho pervert? Before I call in the po-po you got anything else in there?

27:05.200 --> 27:13.200
This is one we also found it's I didn't write who asked it. Shit. I'm gonna say Mark.

27:13.200 --> 27:22.200
Thanks Mark. It couldn't have been Mark because the question is what are some good dodgeball names for eighth grade girls?

27:22.200 --> 27:34.200
Could we like save the questions most likely to get us arrested in sort of a Lenny Bruce type fashion like hauled off the stage for indecency? Go ahead Griff.

27:34.200 --> 27:40.200
Me and some of my friends are in a dodgeball tournament for middle school and we need some names. Any ideas?

27:40.200 --> 27:44.200
For your eighth grade? Is it eighth grade dodgeball team or eighth grade individual?

27:44.200 --> 27:51.200
I think it's person to person. Oh you mean like the hammer? The hammer.

27:51.200 --> 28:00.200
The little hammer. Little hammer. The pony obliterator? Eighth grade girls like...

28:00.200 --> 28:08.200
The pony destroyer? Well no no no no. The glue maker. Please welcome to the ring.

28:08.200 --> 28:13.200
We'll talk about destroying ponies all night long. The main boner. But that's what you're going with?

28:13.200 --> 28:21.200
The main boner of dodgeball prowess is she can throw a dodgeball so hard a pony would explode.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.200
I'll fucking blow up a pony. I don't care.

28:24.200 --> 28:32.200
I'm saying we make a portmanteau. First word something that eighth grade girls like.

28:32.200 --> 28:37.200
The second word is like a really intimidating word of like some sort of damage you can inflict with a dodgeball.

28:37.200 --> 28:48.200
Like princess fuck you up. That's what you mean.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.200
I can't get the pony's ass pounding out of my head but I'm holding myself back.

28:52.200 --> 28:59.200
Whoa! Whoa! I know! Out of decency I didn't say it. I mean I said it but I didn't say it.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.200
I guess you're saying how the sausage gets made because this is exactly the kind of shit like naked babies.

29:03.200 --> 29:08.200
Nope. That's gone. Eighth grade. What was it again? I'm not going to say it again.

29:08.200 --> 29:14.200
Likening out the quinticente right out. That's it. The scrap bin.

29:14.200 --> 29:20.200
I think something oddly robotic would be kind of interesting. Like the smashulator.

29:20.200 --> 29:25.200
The smashulator? But you gotta put like... If her name is Smashley it's perfect.

29:25.200 --> 29:31.200
Smashley is really good. Smashley? Uh huh. That is good.

29:31.200 --> 29:36.200
I want to hear Griffin's last question. But first real quick housekeeping.

29:36.200 --> 29:41.200
Happy two year anniversary to Grant and Amanda who for reasons unbeknownst to me.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.200
Hey guys. Happy two year anniversary.

29:45.200 --> 29:49.200
Sweetheart I love you so much. We're going to have a special night tonight.

29:49.200 --> 29:56.200
Hey you know how you always wanted to see three grown men talk about nicknames for eighth grade girl dodgeball players?

29:56.200 --> 30:00.200
Fucking hop in my coupe. We're driving to Chicago.

30:00.200 --> 30:06.200
And also Johnny Wags and Randy Mac drove eight hours from Marquette, Michigan to hey guys.

30:06.200 --> 30:11.200
Which I was impressed with but it's like I drove eight hours so fuck you.

30:11.200 --> 30:18.200
And thanks to Max Fun and Jordan Justigo for having us and letting us open up for them and share this time with you.

30:18.200 --> 30:25.200
Thank you Dan. Thank you Dan. And thank you Dan. And thank you to all of you guys for coming out.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.200
You've been super cool and we really appreciate you sitting here and listening to us

30:28.200 --> 30:32.200
almost talk about child pornography but not exactly talk about it.

30:32.200 --> 30:37.200
Skirting the danger zone is what we do. Skirting the skirts we like to call it. Skirting the little skirts.

30:37.200 --> 30:43.200
Skirting the squirts. Skirting the skirts. My brother, my brother and me skirting the skirts.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.200
Real talk live. Face to face. That's the part.

30:46.200 --> 30:53.200
Nice try Federal Bureau of Investigation. Maybe next time we'll cut the whole nine yards.

30:53.200 --> 31:00.200
Hit me. This final one is a Yahoo question that was written.

31:00.200 --> 31:05.200
It was authored by Yahoo Answers user Ziggy Monkey Bob 2000 who asks,

31:05.200 --> 31:11.200
Is it considered cheating if you have sex with someone telepathically?

31:11.200 --> 31:14.200
I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

31:14.200 --> 31:24.200
This has been my brother, my brother and me. Kiss your dad square on the lips. Thank you.

31:24.200 --> 31:32.200
Keep it going for the McElroys. My brother, my brother and me.

31:32.200 --> 31:45.200
Look at those pretty fucks. Yay.
