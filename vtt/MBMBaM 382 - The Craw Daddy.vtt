00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.520
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the

00:47.520 --> 00:51.440
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis

00:51.440 --> 00:55.760
McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

00:55.760 --> 01:03.440
Well, they did it again to us. Another year where they couldn't decide which one of us

01:04.400 --> 01:07.120
should be the sexiest man alive and they went with a fourth party.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.920
Every year we get the emails and it's like oh I don't know I think they're and you know what

01:11.920 --> 01:17.440
I think when they send those emails to us pitting us against each other in a sexiest contest I think

01:17.440 --> 01:22.320
they're looking for payola journalists. Well I should tell you guys I actually got the call

01:22.320 --> 01:26.720
they said they were going to name me sexiest man alive but I would have to do an interview

01:26.720 --> 01:33.680
and a photo shoot. Oh come on that's a lot. Very topical. Listen I shouldn't no no no no we can't

01:33.680 --> 01:39.600
go one more second without giving congratulations to the sexiest man alive Blake Shelton.

01:39.600 --> 01:48.560
Congratulations. I'm so proud of you. I do think where he sold it where where did we go wrong

01:48.560 --> 01:55.840
where did Blake go right I think where he sent everyone polaroids of his biceps and I do mean

01:55.840 --> 02:00.480
everyone if you on earth did check your mail recently in the last few weeks you almost

02:00.480 --> 02:06.880
certainly got a polaroid in the mail of Blake Shelton's bicep each one was individually sort

02:06.880 --> 02:12.640
of captured and rendered and along with a personal note that was sort of telling me

02:13.760 --> 02:17.840
just give me some support for the things that are happening in my life right now which I don't know

02:17.840 --> 02:24.960
I mean Blake Shelton is obviously very rich famous from voice and definitely has some sort

02:24.960 --> 02:30.320
of panopticon in his house or laboratory that he uses to watch every living person send them

02:30.320 --> 02:37.600
personalized notes and bicep selfies and thank you Blake Shelton you beautiful fucking waffle

02:37.600 --> 02:44.080
house that a wizard turned into a human being. So proud of you. So proud of you you tall stack

02:44.080 --> 02:50.880
of flapjacks. Who do y'all think is the sexiest man dead? There's a lot I mean we probably wouldn't

02:50.880 --> 02:58.320
know them it was it was some like uh Italian painter from the you know the the 15th century

02:58.320 --> 03:04.160
or something oh that I mean Leonardo da Vinci was fucking ripped you know super ripped he had to be

03:04.160 --> 03:09.440
to lift up his big helicopters and stuff yeah and you just picture him just like he's painting the

03:09.440 --> 03:15.760
Mona Lisa but also he's just like glistening and he's got like a like 16 pack was that him

03:17.120 --> 03:22.640
yeah he did a lot of great stuff like like when he drew the Vitruvian man which was a self-portrait

03:22.640 --> 03:27.200
he drew himself with all his arms and all his legs yeah and the reason if you see a lot of

03:27.200 --> 03:32.480
erasing marks on the penis is because he kept saying like did I do it big enough and he would

03:32.480 --> 03:36.960
ask people like does that look he wouldn't expose himself obviously but like he would ask them like

03:36.960 --> 03:42.800
you look at my body look at what I'm working with here look how swole look how swole look at all the

03:42.800 --> 03:50.080
arms count them count the legs do you feel like I put the penis on enough on this fucking sex

03:50.080 --> 03:56.480
sexual Goro that I drew yeah oh boy guys I'm looking at the page now for the People magazine

03:56.480 --> 04:02.880
they just updated it and Blake's off he got booted from the sexiest spot and they gave it hold on

04:02.880 --> 04:10.480
it's still refreshing the data is being injected into the it is it's Martin Short now huh congratulations

04:10.480 --> 04:16.080
Martin I didn't realize it was a real-time tracker Griffin yeah I mean Blake Shelton's you could

04:16.080 --> 04:21.600
uh you know get cut in a terrible lawnmower accident on his face and body and then people

04:21.600 --> 04:26.880
is gonna be like oh he's got terrible cuts from the lawnmower so now we're gonna get him Martin

04:26.880 --> 04:32.720
Short and the image they use from him is him as Jack Frost from the Santa Claus 3 and they said

04:32.720 --> 04:38.720
that the most erotic yeah he says the sexiest one of him did you guys get the the list sent to you

04:38.720 --> 04:43.600
that ranks everybody you know how when you're like in like important members of the media they send

04:43.600 --> 04:49.680
you actually the full list and it's about five billion pages and it lists like every living man

04:49.680 --> 04:55.040
every living male and shows you where you place there's a little highlighter it takes forever to

04:55.040 --> 05:05.520
find it but I got 12,364,322 I'm not bad there's a billion I am oh wow yeah I'm dead center I am

05:06.720 --> 05:13.760
the average man yeah you're like 1.5 1.8 billion in there I mean I mean right billion so I feel

05:13.760 --> 05:19.360
pretty good about that congratulations that's huge Jess I'm sorry you got the ugliest

05:19.360 --> 05:27.200
list yeah last place again but I'm like rooting for you but it's the ugliest one again golly

05:27.200 --> 05:35.520
hey guys is it possible that ranking people by their looks and talking about like the gender

05:35.520 --> 05:42.720
of the person is it possible that this list might be inherently problematic oh yes oh yeah

05:42.720 --> 05:49.920
yeah but that's why we're that's why we have put our fun irreverent spin South Park humor

05:50.480 --> 05:56.320
yeah I see because we didn't take it seriously we've as they say taken the piss out we've

05:56.320 --> 06:04.880
pissed on it all over it we've stolen its piss of the list because your piss your piss is on my list

06:04.880 --> 06:12.000
the the um the big problem I have with is they almost always pick in November like late November

06:12.000 --> 06:19.280
around this time period yeah and to me not picking Santa just seems like a huge missed opportunity

06:19.280 --> 06:24.160
because you if you're at people and you're like listen I gotta get some juice with the big man

06:24.160 --> 06:31.280
yeah you you you pick Santa right yeah you pick Santa and then like oh ho ho I'm gonna take extra

06:31.280 --> 06:37.200
good care of you this year yeah and and also people you get to meet Santa you get to meet

06:37.200 --> 06:41.840
Santa Claus for the photo shoot and do you think that that's what that would be one good way in

06:41.840 --> 06:45.920
the future I don't know his status right now but like that would be one good way to catch

06:45.920 --> 06:51.760
Chapo if you want to grab El Chapo just like name him name name is got you again El Chapo

06:51.760 --> 06:55.600
and the other thing about doing it November is most showed up for the photo shoot the other thing

06:55.600 --> 06:59.520
about doing November is most of our nation's lawnmower accidents happen in December people

06:59.520 --> 07:03.040
get their new lawnmowers for Christmas they get all excited but they don't read the manual for

07:03.040 --> 07:06.880
the safety instructions Blake comes off cuts them real bad and then all of a sudden your list is

07:06.880 --> 07:12.320
stupid again do you think when they named it Blake Shelton they sat him down and like we need you to

07:12.320 --> 07:18.240
drive five miles under the speed limit don't eat any old food we just need you to be super careful

07:18.240 --> 07:22.320
because we've already taken the pictures we've already written the thing we just need you to

07:22.320 --> 07:28.560
hang on till the end of November um so again we were overlooked we're not going to get all bent

07:28.560 --> 07:33.360
out of shape about it like we always do we're going to move on and continue to do our podcasts

07:33.920 --> 07:40.240
that we that we do um do you think we're the sexiest podcasters fuck no not even in the top

07:40.240 --> 07:49.120
ten damn it uh sadly but are we the sexiest brother podcasters alive uh probably not I mean

07:49.120 --> 07:55.120
probably not probably not you have apparently you have the ugliest person according to Griffin well

07:55.120 --> 08:00.320
the physically ugliest person so like the average is going to be drawn down I just want to say

08:00.320 --> 08:06.400
Justin I think you're beautiful and you have a beautiful body but the people but People magazine

08:06.400 --> 08:12.800
voted and they agreed ugliest on you so and I didn't say it speaking of this uh I didn't tell

08:12.800 --> 08:19.200
you guys this but um my when I told my dentist that we were had shot the tv show and I was

08:19.200 --> 08:25.440
shooting another thing uh which you should hear about soon uh and I was telling her about this

08:25.440 --> 08:33.680
she said that I should probably have my teeth fixed cool I had never even like considered it

08:33.680 --> 08:39.440
before but she was like you have nice teeth you just need to pull them together a little bit the

08:39.440 --> 08:46.560
year Justin gets adult braces can I get adult braces I don't think so I don't think that I could get

08:46.560 --> 08:52.560
adult braces oh I would love for you to know my corn chips struggle my boy I'm not detracting from

08:52.560 --> 08:57.120
anybody who has adult braces like please it had just never occurred to me but you know I'm trying

08:57.120 --> 09:02.400
to make progress there so maybe I will get to a point where to reach peak physical perfection

09:02.400 --> 09:07.680
which is so important so essential look at look at what DaVinci did with his body is the work of

09:07.680 --> 09:14.560
art oh my god guys People magazine just updated Martin Short they put up a little brief uh message

09:14.560 --> 09:23.120
from the editor saying like we made a mistake and now Justin is it yeah first your confidence

09:23.120 --> 09:29.440
your confidence made you very sexual and really wants to fuck you People magazine thanks beans

09:29.440 --> 09:34.720
let's get into the question well before we do okay stick around after the show for a special candle

09:34.720 --> 09:40.320
night's announcement oh okay don't go nowhere make sure you see that ending why are we doing it right

09:40.320 --> 09:45.600
now why are we doing a teaser for I love that I love a teaser okay we're gonna do a candle night

09:45.600 --> 09:51.120
show I said is that straight okay well we'll talk about at the end my mom teaches taekwondo at an

09:51.120 --> 09:55.680
elementary school and the other day one of her students declared that he could beat her in a

09:55.680 --> 10:00.960
fight keep in mind my mom is a fully grown martial arts teacher and this kid is like seven his logic

10:00.960 --> 10:06.000
was that boys are stronger than girls hachi machi so it must be stronger than my mom my mom said of

10:06.000 --> 10:11.440
course come at me and the kid did his best to kick her so she just picked him up uh he thinks

10:11.440 --> 10:16.320
he's won this fight and some of the other students agree how can my mom teach this boy that girls can

10:16.320 --> 10:21.120
be strong too and win back the respect of her class without actually hitting a child that's

10:21.120 --> 10:26.880
from surprised by sexist seven-year-old okay there is a lot going on holy shit unpack here

10:26.880 --> 10:32.960
can we start with the basic premise of taekwondo school at elementary school that seems like a

10:32.960 --> 10:40.800
uh that seems i i well i guess we don't know where to teach jump rope griffin pull-ups i guess huh

10:41.600 --> 10:48.800
i don't think that it's okay all right i think it's great to teach kids taekwondo it's a great

10:48.800 --> 10:54.800
physical mental i'm a huge fan of taekwondo this should be no like there should be no question

10:54.800 --> 11:02.800
about that i think that i think that that is very good i think that where you start to get into some

11:02.800 --> 11:08.720
muddy water is when you fight a seven-year-old to prove how tough you are that does seem to be

11:08.720 --> 11:14.720
how tough women how tough women are which they you really shouldn't okay like agree but you are

11:14.720 --> 11:20.400
this is where the issue gets complex is because by being an adult fighting a seven-year-old you're

11:20.400 --> 11:26.160
not necessarily proving anything regarded to gender i think what you're more proving is in the

11:26.160 --> 11:31.760
vein of adults versus kids which is always going to be like the confidence of that kid i mean it's

11:31.760 --> 11:37.440
not confidence it's sexism it's like girls so i can beat up any girl i had a gym teacher once

11:37.440 --> 11:44.800
who said that the best uh woman basketball player on earth could not be the worst male basketball

11:44.800 --> 11:50.080
player this is middle school and it's like the dumbest like dude come on that's the dumbest you

11:50.080 --> 11:55.760
you know that's the dumbest fucking shit you've ever said like i've ever heard in my entire life

11:55.760 --> 12:02.400
i'm the worst male basketball player yeah has a list of best basketball players traps last place

12:02.400 --> 12:07.680
again it's okay here's the here's the solution to this okay especially since all the kids are

12:07.680 --> 12:14.880
getting in on it some of the other students agree you say i do agree that you doing your cool taekwondo

12:14.880 --> 12:22.400
to a child doesn't prove anything but go to bath and body works okay you buy up all the pillows that

12:22.400 --> 12:27.600
they got on their shelf you mean bed bath and beyond right what did i say bath and body works

12:28.160 --> 12:33.200
you buy up all the lotions and potions get bed bath behind buy up all the bed builds that they

12:33.200 --> 12:37.440
have on their shelf well just let me introduce myself i'm the person who's about to suggest that

12:37.440 --> 12:43.440
you put pillows all over every boy in the classroom and fight all of them on box style and if they

12:43.440 --> 12:49.760
have the pillow armor you can you don't have to restrain yourself you can really just wail on them

12:49.760 --> 12:57.440
not to injure but to humiliate and you take down all of them and all of a sudden maybe now we've

12:57.440 --> 13:03.120
we've proved there are very good answers here but like the answers the answers that we would have

13:03.120 --> 13:08.960
would be if you want to teach this lesson what you need to do is train one of the girls in the

13:08.960 --> 13:15.360
class is approximately this boy's age to beat the stuffing out of him and like but again yeah that

13:15.360 --> 13:21.040
would be awesome that would be so cool for like a second and then not cool for all following

13:21.040 --> 13:27.600
seconds all following seconds after that you are unemployable now i will say in the defense of your

13:28.960 --> 13:36.160
students and sort of in their camp for a second uh as i understand it picking someone up

13:36.160 --> 13:42.480
is not sort of a legal competitive taekwondo it's like some move you can't use your hands

13:42.480 --> 13:49.280
in taekwondo that's just like no i mean no no no holding holding is not is not a thing in taekwondo

13:49.280 --> 13:56.000
so like i don't think that you did win in taekwondo you can't do the thing where like you put your

13:56.000 --> 14:01.600
palm on their forehead and let them kind of swing their arms oh that's good no that's so good but

14:01.600 --> 14:06.560
like you know if you're going like yeah not taekwondo really here's here's the best solution

14:06.560 --> 14:12.320
for this little boy comes up to you and says i want to fight you because all boys are stronger

14:12.320 --> 14:18.800
than all women and you say okay go to the principal's office you have detention now

14:19.680 --> 14:23.840
and then they get their principal's office for detention and then you turn to the wrestle class

14:23.840 --> 14:31.040
and say anybody else want to espouse some dumb shit anybody else feeling froggy and want to leap

14:31.040 --> 14:37.200
right i don't think you can imprison children for ideas i'm not sure how like oh no you would

14:37.200 --> 14:42.240
falsify the you would falsify a report and say like you call me a fucker and did a big cuss in

14:42.240 --> 14:48.080
front of that's strength that's pretty sure freedom of speech does not apply to an elementary

14:48.080 --> 14:53.600
school class if this kid gets up and says i want to fight you i think you'd be like cool bye i want

14:53.600 --> 14:57.760
to fight you to prove that men are stronger than women okay you are going to sit in a special room

14:57.760 --> 15:02.240
during lunch and not be with your friends you piece of shit you are in trouble now because

15:02.240 --> 15:08.000
you're being an asshole yeah i don't know where this kid got this uh message unless he's ever

15:08.000 --> 15:13.360
turned on a tv or watched a movie or read a comic book like i i don't know where he's getting these

15:13.360 --> 15:21.280
these wild ideas from um how about a yahoo uh wait did we fix it though yes i don't know

15:21.280 --> 15:27.200
the fucking detention you don't you don't have to do a physical fight um how about a yahoo yeah

15:27.200 --> 15:31.680
but this one's gonna keep me up at night yeah no it's not good it's it's it's it's not good because

15:31.680 --> 15:37.840
it's it's everything it's all of it it's almost like it's almost like it's a pervasive issue

15:37.840 --> 15:43.040
that reaches through every part of our society and culture it's one of the weirdest it's one

15:43.040 --> 15:47.920
of the very weird outlier pervasive issues that influences every aspect of our culture

15:47.920 --> 15:52.240
that you can't pick it fixed by punching a seven-year-old in the face and there are so

15:52.240 --> 15:58.240
many that would be sort of fixed by the global warming global warming for sure obviously um

15:58.240 --> 16:03.760
um wage gap wage gap definitely here's a yahoo from lauren mcgregor thank you lauren it's yeah

16:03.760 --> 16:12.480
it's an anonymous yahoo answers user so i'm gonna call them uh david asks i got fired from a

16:12.480 --> 16:18.400
restaurant does that mean i can't eat there anymore no additional details just were you

16:18.400 --> 16:27.600
uh the olive garden was that sort of a you decision or a them decision olive garden was well

16:28.560 --> 16:34.000
olive garden hired me as a dishwasher and then i saw the dishwasher that was going to train me

16:34.720 --> 16:45.040
shoot a ramekin of uh uh uh zupa toscana uh shoot it like um uh an oatmeal cookie shot

16:45.040 --> 16:49.680
just kind of like jam it off of somebody's tray that came back and i was like i cannot learn at

16:49.680 --> 16:54.240
the feet of this man yeah and i lied and when they asked me what job they hired me for i lied

16:54.240 --> 17:02.720
and said chef head chef i did sort of con my way into that gig uh my bad uh so they would have had

17:02.720 --> 17:09.920
grounds to fire me at literally any moment definitely until they saw how good i was at uh

17:09.920 --> 17:16.640
grilling swordfish piccata or chicken tenders um so they they you know they would have a hard time

17:16.640 --> 17:21.360
saying goodbye to me then uh but i did quit that job and it's not because i disliked the cooking

17:22.000 --> 17:26.960
i i liked that part but at the end of the night you'd have to get down on hands and knees

17:26.960 --> 17:34.080
and spray the floor off with a hose and you would get soaked in what everyone in the kitchen called

17:34.080 --> 17:40.960
ochi water and it was a very unpleasant powerful all around no it was unpleasant for us at home

17:40.960 --> 17:46.240
because you would come home and now i lived in an olive garden yeah where where i was family always

17:46.240 --> 17:50.320
and when you're there your family literally because there's your house uh so that is that

17:50.320 --> 17:59.920
is why i resigned from there but if you had gotten fired for stealing gnocchi i don't think you could

17:59.920 --> 18:04.880
i don't think going back legally you can go back but why would you want to why would you want to

18:04.880 --> 18:09.680

tagline of rallies and by extension checkers is you gotta eat which is kind of which is sort of

18:52.880 --> 18:58.000
depressing yeah they gave up i mean like you have to eat why not come here you could do it here if

19:17.840 --> 19:24.560
be trusted i have some breaking news this is not a munch squad it is just some breaking news about

19:24.560 --> 19:29.440
olive garden that i i google olive garden because i want to see some new menu specials uh that i

19:29.440 --> 19:33.840
could like say like i don't want to try it what if i want to try this you know it's new uh there's

19:33.840 --> 19:44.400
an arkansas couple named jordan and justin garton and uh they had a unlimited pasta pass um so they

19:44.400 --> 19:48.640
started going to a restaurant that you have probably guessed the name of and yes it's olive

19:48.640 --> 19:55.360
garden and then they uh gave birth they're giving birth to their daughter december 6th is the due

19:55.360 --> 19:59.600
date no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you may if you remember their last name

20:00.480 --> 20:08.720
is garton this little baby's name is going to be olivia garton oh okay and she is going

20:08.720 --> 20:15.840
to save all of us olivia garton when you were born december 6th and then the beam of light

20:16.720 --> 20:21.840
is in a shaft comes down from heaven uh you are going to be the one that will deliver us from

20:21.840 --> 20:27.600
everything it's all been leading up to olivia garton and she's gonna turn it all around the

20:27.600 --> 20:34.000
mother of pasta is olivia garton now we looked at a list of italian girl names and none of them

20:34.000 --> 20:39.680
and none of them really felt perfect until we landed on olivia the pair also considered olive

20:39.680 --> 20:42.960
but even though they liked the humor in the name sounding like the restaurant they said

20:42.960 --> 20:47.680
it along something subtler can i say i prove very much yeah very good you have chosen the

20:47.680 --> 20:53.760
funniest version of what you are doing do you think that she'll be able to and this may sound

20:53.760 --> 21:01.920
a little wild but stick with me here speak to pasta commune with a bowl of alfredo sauce like

21:01.920 --> 21:06.080
like understand like read its thoughts and communicate with it like aquaman

21:06.960 --> 21:13.440
probably i mean what's the point otherwise okay so it is gonna sort of transition into

21:14.960 --> 21:15.680
weird how that

21:18.880 --> 21:25.520
i want a munch squad this is lowered in an octave i want too much

21:25.520 --> 21:34.080
my voice is kind of fucked up this one comes to us from jonah i would like tomorrow it's not

21:34.080 --> 21:40.080
necessarily not necessarily a fast food one we're branching out a little bit here but this is just

21:40.080 --> 21:46.960
too good to pass up and i am gonna send y'all the link to this one in skype just so you can see

21:46.960 --> 21:52.880
because the imagery on this is so fucking good this one comes to us from the kellogg's company

21:52.880 --> 21:59.600
creators of pringles this thanksgiving pringles is giving bringing all your holiday favorites to

21:59.600 --> 22:04.960
the snacking table you know the thing that exists with the new and exclusive limited edition

22:04.960 --> 22:11.680

22:11.680 --> 22:19.360
saddest way to fill your day congratulations this dinner is so deliciously close to the real thing

it may become part of your own tradition so each pringles thanksgiving dinner which is a tray

22:27.200 --> 22:32.400
with a picture of a real thanksgiving dinner on it just to make sure just you're very depressed

22:33.760 --> 22:41.040
and the press photo of this shows the tray surrounded by a spoon knife and hilariously

22:41.040 --> 22:46.320
two forks yeah i don't know necessarily if it wanted to show you what you were really going to

22:46.320 --> 22:51.440
use as a supplement it would show you just a pair of nasty jeans that you're gonna rub the

22:52.240 --> 23:00.480
the coating onto so each pringles thanksgiving tray it has the mouthwatering crisps they're not

23:00.480 --> 23:05.280
chips they're crisp because they're rehydrated potato granules they uh in eight new thanksgiving

23:05.280 --> 23:11.680
themed flavors here are the flavors which i'm going to say and they are going to be real let's

23:11.680 --> 23:16.560
give them a let's can we give them a rating as we go because some of these are pretty out there

23:16.560 --> 23:23.360
yeah one to ten one to ten turkey eight eight would would chew mashed potatoes that is pringles

23:23.360 --> 23:27.680
you have described everything you've not described pringles yeah stuffing

23:30.000 --> 23:37.200
maybe that i'm gonna say seven if they nail it cranberry sauce negative 20 100 billion gross no

23:37.200 --> 23:42.960
point one save some room griffin of the bottom of the scale because after that is creamed corn

23:42.960 --> 23:49.120
absolute zero no is it travis because right after that is green bean casserole dumpster

23:49.120 --> 23:54.160
dumpster out of ten green bean casserole that i am in cream corn following that mac and cheese

23:54.160 --> 23:58.320
all right probably y'all could probably swing that then right at the end there bringing up the real

23:58.320 --> 24:06.880
rear in this fucking uh uh violet beau regard of a dinner is pumpkin pie yeah love dessert

24:06.880 --> 24:14.320
pringles is a thing i let's this this it should just okay looking at the packaging how much

24:14.320 --> 24:20.880
packaging there is for so few chips it should just say like oh also we hate the environment

24:20.880 --> 24:27.840
fuck the environment love these chips we use 12 pounds of packaging for two ounces of chips

24:27.840 --> 24:33.040
let's check in with kurt simon senior director of marketing for pringles uh easiest job in the

24:33.040 --> 24:37.440
world by the way these little bad boys sell themselves yeah pringles are known for bold

24:37.440 --> 24:43.040
flavors and endless flavor stacking possibilities so this holiday season we wanted to introduce

24:43.040 --> 24:48.880
snack lovers to a new way to enjoy thanksgiving favorites the pringles thanksgiving dinner

24:48.880 --> 24:56.080
flavors are not only new but cover every course of the real meal from the main event to sides

24:56.080 --> 25:01.360
and even dessert kurt was really struggling for things to say so he decided to just re-describe

25:01.360 --> 25:07.040
that's every fucking pr blast about every thing that's ever been in the munch these are chips

25:07.040 --> 25:14.880
that we made strange can we talk about they have right below this an image with suggested combos

25:14.880 --> 25:22.320
some recipes and so one the leftover sandwich okay turkey flavored chip stuffing flavored chip

25:22.320 --> 25:26.720
and mashed potato flavored chip all right wood crush i'm gonna i'm gonna skip the second one

25:26.720 --> 25:33.840
come back to that number three the touchdown green bean casserole mac and cheese cream corn okay now

25:33.840 --> 25:40.240
in your mouth at the same time yeah your human mouth you know the only one you get until you

25:40.240 --> 25:45.600
die as a that one is the one you're gonna put three chips of those flavors into it says in

25:45.600 --> 25:54.000
parentheses underneath only eat as prank or dare only yeah and then number two titled the holiday

25:54.000 --> 26:01.760
sweater cranberry sauce pumpkin pie and mashed potato it's called the holiday sweater because

26:01.760 --> 26:07.280
your body reflexively rejects it and you vomit it on whatever shirt you're wearing at that time each

26:07.280 --> 26:12.880
of these combinations is named after the thing you would rather eat than the chips so the leftover

26:12.880 --> 26:18.080
sandwich obvious i would rather eat a touchdown than those three things and i would definitely

26:18.080 --> 26:26.480
rather eat a holiday sweater than cranberry pumpkin mashed potato pringles yakaruni uh here's

26:26.480 --> 26:30.960
the worst part are you ready for like the dagger through your heart for this exclusive rollout the

26:30.960 --> 26:36.080
pringles thanksgiving dinner is a pilot taste test and has only limited availability the dinner is

26:36.080 --> 26:39.920
not available for retail this season but who knows what the future of pringles stacking and

26:39.920 --> 26:44.400
snacking will bring so you're gonna try this fucking out you're gonna show this to me and

26:44.400 --> 26:50.000
then you're not even gonna let me buy it really as a joke pringles you are gonna challenge my

26:50.000 --> 26:56.160
my concept of what it means to eat with my human mouth and then not let me buy it and make my

26:56.160 --> 27:03.280
friends eat it assholes it's so cruel i just wanted to buy it let me buy it you've done such

27:03.280 --> 27:09.280
a great job selling it i want to eat the holiday sweater p.o box 54 huntington west virginia 25706

27:09.280 --> 27:14.320
if you can just get your hands on one of these and get that over to me yeah and i have

27:14.320 --> 27:18.160
a pringles i got a special way of getting mailed to me and it's just if you put these in any

27:18.160 --> 27:23.120
dumpster it'll find its way to austin hq guaranteed all right here's another question

27:24.000 --> 27:28.640
so last weekend i got pretty drunk at a family wedding and i guess i ordered like six dozen

27:28.640 --> 27:36.080
small plastic crawdads they arrived today they're actually pretty nice but like what am i supposed

27:36.080 --> 27:42.720
to do with them that's from copious crawdads in the oregon capitol uh i've been there i think

27:42.720 --> 27:47.840
i think we've talked about that amazon the amazon app should have a breathalyzer on it yeah i i buy

27:47.840 --> 27:54.000
some things so i drank a few too many glasses of wine and then said to myself i'm an adult and i

27:54.000 --> 28:01.120
could buy things if i want and went on amazon and for some reason impulsively bought pipes because

28:01.120 --> 28:07.200
i'm an adult i guess and then when they came uh i was i forgot ordering them when they came they

28:07.200 --> 28:13.920
were like tiny pipe replicas which i did not realize when i bought them i guess and i still

28:13.920 --> 28:18.880
hold on to those to remind myself that i am not an adult yeah you're a child a little boy maybe

28:18.880 --> 28:22.560
we could get these two together and we could put a little pipe in each one of these crawdads mouths

28:22.560 --> 28:27.840
and now all of a sudden we got our arts what do you think what do you think the phrase they're

28:27.840 --> 28:34.720
actually pretty nice means in relation to small plastic well we've all seen shitty fake plastic

28:34.720 --> 28:42.480
crawdads these don't look real these don't look appetizing but these are top quality small plastic

28:42.480 --> 28:48.480
crawdads i mean next time you have um you know a pot a pot boil what's it called the low country

28:48.480 --> 28:55.600
boil you throw one of these in and it's like the king baby i feel like you would probably

28:57.360 --> 29:02.000
you i mean you probably wouldn't be able to return these right like amazon would be so stoked

29:02.000 --> 29:06.080
about getting rid of them that they would probably not let you these are jeff bezos's

29:07.040 --> 29:13.040
crawdads and he hates them i hate all these i'm worth more 10 billion dollars but i money can't

29:13.040 --> 29:18.000
buy you happiness only getting rid of all of these plastic crawdads that i have these

29:18.000 --> 29:22.640
curtains the curse will be lifted these cursive crawdads what if you just started

29:23.520 --> 29:29.840
handing them out to people as business cards and maybe on them you could write

29:29.840 --> 29:35.120
what would you have room for your twitter handle i guess that's about it huh yeah probably but they

29:35.120 --> 29:39.680
would never forget it no and then they would have it and it would be their problem now i have the

29:39.680 --> 29:43.840
crot let me hit you with this do you possibly throw away the crawdad do you possibly have a

29:43.840 --> 29:50.240
local sports team that does not have a mascot oh if it does have a mascot maybe you could be sort

29:50.240 --> 29:55.040
of an unofficial like the towel man for the saint louis blues just like an enthusiastic fan who has

29:55.040 --> 30:01.680

a new thing in rocky horror and try to act like it's a thing that everybody does like you throw

31:49.040 --> 31:55.040
the toilet paper and then in the one scene where the crawdaddy shows up at the giant talking one

31:55.040 --> 32:01.600
it's all sexy yeah and it's got like stilettos and stuff every time he comes on the screen oh in my

town where we come from we always throw plastic crawdads oh you guys don't have any let me sell

44:24.560 --> 44:29.840
lines the yucky mess you just made in the toilet we're gonna get all that out of the show yeah

44:29.840 --> 44:34.400
because we don't want people to know that you do that kind of thing all right all right so just

44:34.400 --> 44:41.520

44:42.080 --> 44:48.800
uh-huh that's good hey way to go Rick yeah and I'll just put that in and and when I put that in

44:48.800 --> 44:53.360
I'll drop it in one of the parts where he talked about all the uh horrible noises and the toilet

44:53.360 --> 44:59.120
bowl stink and and Justin can I just say I let me assure you we're not going to use this but um

44:59.120 --> 45:04.320
they asked for could we get one line where you apologize for what you did with your butt yeah

45:05.440 --> 45:10.160
we're not gonna use it but you're not okay I don't really understand okay they just want it

45:10.160 --> 45:14.800
for comparison that's all okay sorry about what I did with my butt yeah and so let me get one

45:14.800 --> 45:19.440
more because I have the audio tools I use has noise canceling but you have to have the sample

45:19.440 --> 45:24.160
of the noise uh first that you're canceling out so if you can just say like I made a toilet mess

45:24.160 --> 45:29.520
and then I'll use that too and it'll catch in the filter all the other uh stuff that we said about

45:29.520 --> 45:35.680
you making a toilet mess so just say that out loud I made a toilet mess and then yeah and I'll use

45:35.680 --> 45:39.680
that and then nobody else is going to hear it for the rest of the perfect so good perfect how's it

45:39.680 --> 45:44.160
going everyone I'm Oliver Wang and I'm Morgan Rhodes we have a brand new show on the maximum

45:44.160 --> 45:48.560
fun network that we'd love to share with you it's called Heat Rocks Morgan we should probably

45:48.560 --> 45:55.120
explain what a heat rock is it is a banger a fire track true fire right dope album each episode we

45:55.120 --> 45:59.600
will bring on a special guest to join us to talk about one of their heat rocks it might be a musician

45:59.600 --> 46:04.080
a writer maybe a scholar I mean I would have been happy to just talk to you about your heat rocks

46:04.080 --> 46:08.640

46:12.800 --> 46:19.920
out heat rocks hello yahoo oh okay yeah sure this one was sent in by Kevin Budnick thank you Kevin

46:19.920 --> 46:26.320
it's from an another anonymous yahoo answers user I'm gonna call them um uh dancing hip-hop

46:26.320 --> 46:31.840
goose super fun educational because that's the amazon ad that I have at the top of my website

46:31.840 --> 46:36.800
right now perfect and let me say this goose does look like a really cool educational hip-hop goose

46:36.800 --> 46:44.800
it's got a backwards hat on okay so anyway uh dancing hip-hop goose super fun educational asks

46:44.800 --> 46:51.840
is it possible to eat a banana without feeling rude and this is funny to even think about when

46:51.840 --> 46:55.120
sometimes people eat it and I'm not talking about it in the way that I did it where I changed the

46:55.120 --> 47:01.120
course of human history but the way where everybody eats it and maybe somebody will make a

47:01.120 --> 47:06.480
a foul joke and I hate these and so I think it would be much better if we had a different way of

47:06.480 --> 47:13.360
doing this where you didn't open yourself up for that to that opportunity I'd like to make a pitch

47:13.360 --> 47:22.240
okay fully on peel banana eat like corn on the cob now we're talking so you eat the the the skin

47:22.240 --> 47:28.000
first fully on no you completely take remove the peel and then you hold it and then you eat it

47:28.000 --> 47:34.720
no you completely take remove the peel and then you hold it long wise and then like take bites

47:34.720 --> 47:40.400
down and rotate take bites down rotate yeah that's a good option in a film I like to call

47:40.400 --> 47:48.000
pulver mull cop 2 a gentleman named myrtle eats a banana that's so repellently old that all the

47:48.000 --> 47:55.200
comedy in the scene and there's plenty to go around yeah uh is is derived from the age of

47:55.200 --> 48:01.360
the banana and not necessarily the phallic shape of the banana I think hey can we just

48:01.360 --> 48:06.400
congratulate paul blart mall cop 2 for not taking that no pun intended low-hanging fruit

48:07.760 --> 48:12.880
yeah they evolve the gag they evolve the gag a bit so you're saying just only eat old bananas

48:12.880 --> 48:17.920
like our friend and paul blart mall cop 2 does very old bananas like myrtle the security guard

48:18.720 --> 48:23.440
or the shipping whatever his job doesn't matter none of this fucking matters

48:23.440 --> 48:28.560
uh that's one option can you unpeel it and put the whole thing your mouth sideways like a big

48:28.560 --> 48:33.840
smile and then people will say like oh what a beautiful smile you have but they won't know

48:33.840 --> 48:42.080
it's a banana or maybe just like put it in a blender and then drink it yeah or mush it up in

48:42.080 --> 48:48.400
a cup with a fork or mush it with your hands in front of them and say like don't get any ideas

48:48.400 --> 48:55.040
don't get any ideas and then smush it in a big ball with your hands uh-huh i like that or maybe

48:55.040 --> 48:59.280
like start to eat it and then look at somebody and be like no you'll make this dirty and then

48:59.280 --> 49:06.320
throw the whole banana away can we just only eat banana ruts and then you just can pop those right

49:06.320 --> 49:12.160
in there and it's not even a thing what about deep fried banana is that a thing i mean you're

49:12.160 --> 49:16.560
still this still gonna have the same sort of physical shape yeah but no one's ever eating

49:16.560 --> 49:21.920
fried pickles and somebody's like like a wiener there's lots of ways we can evolve the banana

49:21.920 --> 49:25.680
though like if we're gonna get into culinary solutions i think that's too broad i mean you

49:25.680 --> 49:31.440
could split it in half and dump some ice cream on it and enjoy a delicious whoa slow down i would

49:31.440 --> 49:38.560
still know you would know you're eating the rude fruit i would say good one i'm just eating a banana

49:38.560 --> 49:43.360
split i'm at baskin roms with my family my son just won the big baseball game i know but dude

49:43.360 --> 49:49.680
you're eating the rude fruit bud you know like but you ever seen anybody eat the norway bud

49:50.720 --> 49:52.240
you get it you know that looks like

49:56.240 --> 50:02.160
nice that is the worst baskin robbins employee possible if they just order like i'll have a

50:02.160 --> 50:09.520
banana oh nice nice dude it's hilarious i think you should carry a megaphone around

50:09.520 --> 50:15.920
and whenever you're eating the rude fruit banana and somebody says like like a penis you hand them

50:15.920 --> 50:21.200
the megaphone and say why don't you tell the world and you know really stand by your joke you're very

50:21.200 --> 50:25.520
funny very funny joke why don't you go ahead and broadcast here i'll open up all the windows of the

50:25.520 --> 50:30.240
house turn this one full blast you can let everybody know your fun joke you fucking child

50:30.240 --> 50:35.840
rip their phone out of their hand find find their mom or their mom or their pastor tell your pastor

50:35.840 --> 50:41.920
this great joke you just said now tell your mom the joke you made about the rude fruit

50:41.920 --> 50:49.520
and how it looks like a cock dennis yeah good joke i guess yeah pretty good joke dennis

50:49.520 --> 50:55.440
i deliver pizzas but i've made a terrible mistake i let it slip that i've started doing stand-up

50:55.440 --> 51:01.360
comedy to one of our regulars and he asked me to do a set on his front porch for him oh

51:01.360 --> 51:09.760
oh my god i didn't make him laugh well but he tipped me really well and told me to keep it

51:10.400 --> 51:15.520
the problem is that now he only orders when he knows i'm on shift and requests me as his driver

51:16.080 --> 51:21.760
that doesn't seem like it should be in the pizza laws uh that's from me that's editorializing

51:21.760 --> 51:25.120
that doesn't seem like something you should be able to do that seems like there's a lot of

51:25.120 --> 51:30.400
problems with that he asked me to do a new set every time i haven't made him laugh yet and he

51:30.400 --> 51:36.000
keeps offering me advice that doesn't help because he has never tried comedy as he keeps saying but

51:36.000 --> 51:41.360
i'm running out of material i am tired of bombing to this one person on his porch in the middle of

51:41.360 --> 51:46.480
a shift but he tips really well i don't know what to do brothers do i lie and tell him i've

51:46.480 --> 51:51.920
stopped trying will that make his tips disappear please help that's from becoming more and more

51:51.920 --> 52:00.720
dour in dallas you can't tell him you you stop trying he'd be so disappointed in you i bet it's

52:00.720 --> 52:08.640
jerry seinfeld you think it's jerry i think it's jerry we all know he lives in dallas now big cowboys

52:08.640 --> 52:15.440
fan and he's trying to he's trying to this is how he has to break you down before he can build you

52:15.440 --> 52:21.600
back up again i don't know why he lied and said that he has never tried comedy and i don't know

52:21.600 --> 52:28.400
why you didn't recognize very famous man jerry seinfeld but he's got the goatee now he does have

52:28.400 --> 52:34.320
the goatee and he looks great oh that's what it is jerry you look real good maybe your problem is

52:34.320 --> 52:40.240
you're trying jokes and not every comedian is going to find their way with that could you um

52:40.240 --> 52:47.200
when you arrive and he opens the door just get a big hammer and smash his pizza right now that's

52:47.200 --> 52:55.280
very good that's very good that could be very fun every time oh i i think you need to reframe this

52:55.280 --> 53:01.840
you're a professional comedian yes what level wait hold on before we move on what level of

53:01.840 --> 53:09.200
comedic desperation do you think gallagher was at when he said well i guess i could just smash

53:09.200 --> 53:15.120
melons with a hammer like you have to be pretty frustrated with the whole joke game to decide

53:15.120 --> 53:21.040
that that's how you're going in this scenario he had a whole bit about unsmashed melons and he was

53:21.040 --> 53:25.840
like y'all ever seen a watermelon before what's this big green thing supposed to cut it up for

53:25.840 --> 53:31.120
my family at a barbecue no thanks who wants to spit out seeds the whole time sounds like a lot

53:31.120 --> 53:37.280
of work to me boo gallagher you fucking stink dude nobody cares about your melon jokes you're

53:37.280 --> 53:45.440
right fuck smash oh damn hold on you're onto something my dude so here i am sitting on my

53:45.440 --> 53:51.280
regular sized couches i keep losing things in between the cushions this sucks i wish the couch

53:51.280 --> 53:58.640
was bigger oh great advice jerry seinfeld in the audience i think you have to fail a lot to get

53:58.640 --> 54:02.720
good at stand-up comedy that's how i understand it that's why i'll never get into that particular

54:02.720 --> 54:08.560
field because i think you do have to bomb repeatedly and i can think a few safer spaces

54:09.280 --> 54:16.640
to bomb then on someone's porch and at the end you get money yeah right hold the pizza anymore

54:16.640 --> 54:22.160
it seems like a pretty good place to try out new material honestly let me float this is it

54:22.160 --> 54:27.920
possible this person who is ordering the pizzas is a big big pervert who is so drunk off of the

54:27.920 --> 54:33.520
power differential here where they're like yes tell me a joke tell me a joke dominoes boy

54:35.360 --> 54:42.640
very good not very good actually it sucked i'll never laugh at your jokes i'm i'm disappointed

54:42.640 --> 54:47.680
in this pervert man well because you that should go without saying how high are your comedic

54:47.680 --> 54:53.440
standards that you have made the pizza delivery person tell you a joke and then you think not

54:53.440 --> 55:03.600
good enough maybe next time give them a laugh who is this masked stranger who says do a stand-up

55:03.600 --> 55:09.200
who's got the gall to say do stand up for me pizza person i know you have other deliveries

55:09.200 --> 55:15.360

55:47.360 --> 55:55.120

56:06.560 --> 56:08.320
thank you for the kind derrick

56:12.160 --> 56:17.040
i do want to say that yahoo answers user open container laws says why do you care what happens

56:17.040 --> 56:20.880
when you die you're going to hell anyway at this rate if you don't stop taking drugs

56:21.840 --> 56:29.760
says me open container laws yeah um can you turn my ashes into vape juice after i die so i can be

56:29.760 --> 56:35.200

56:35.200 --> 56:40.560
pg to not you know fuck up the coils with that kind of no i mean i'm gonna fuck up the coils

56:40.560 --> 56:45.680
it'll be a one time one time burn yeah and it's gonna be a it's gonna be a heady rip like

56:45.680 --> 56:53.120
i'm that would be pretty choice though if you could get one really good choice rip and then blow

56:53.120 --> 56:58.720
it out over the atlantic ocean yeah because then anytime that your wife saw a cloud she could tell

56:58.720 --> 57:03.840
your son that's your daddy your many daughters that's your daddy he watches over us he watches

57:03.840 --> 57:12.320
over us from the sky your uncle justin blew him up there the big rip he did a rings trick

57:12.320 --> 57:17.760
he did a huge rings trick he did a big rings trick and everyone said cool i love you griffin goodbye

57:17.760 --> 57:23.920
it's time to let go but i miss cotton now honey i miss papa griffin you don't have to because he's

57:23.920 --> 57:31.360
everywhere and all around us anytime you see someone rip a huge oh my god put my ashes into

57:32.080 --> 57:40.560
the vape juice repository in new mexico the reserves so from then on anytime that someone

57:40.560 --> 57:47.840
rips just some huge cotton that's really grilly cranks they crank some cotton out there's a little

57:47.840 --> 57:57.040
bit of me in every cloud that gets puffed out over every um children's birthday party it's all

57:57.040 --> 58:04.960
it's all got a little bit of me in there and then when it rains what is that sweat yeah people vape

58:04.960 --> 58:13.920
enough and put enough of that in the environment can we safely assume at some point that the rain

58:13.920 --> 58:23.680
will be more vape juice more cotton candy granny smith apples i want to live in that world but also

58:23.680 --> 58:27.680
there's a little bit of me in there because i died and justin ripped me up into the sky

58:27.680 --> 58:36.160
into the sky that's so beautiful hey when i die can you guys just put me in another person

58:36.160 --> 58:42.560
like your brain like inject you interspace style i mean more just like i want to i want to be

58:42.560 --> 58:51.040
another person or just me again yeah that's fine that's fine that's fine but uh-huh when gallagher

58:51.040 --> 58:58.560
smashes that urn and since no i changed my mind that is exactly what i want nobody wants nobody

58:58.560 --> 59:04.960
wants to die but if you could rest go to your final rest knowing that gallagher or his son

59:04.960 --> 59:10.320
gallagher 3 because there's already gallagher 2 his son gallagher 3 will smash your ashes over

59:10.320 --> 59:15.120
the crowd like that would be very comforting i feel like anytime you see someone that enjoys

59:15.120 --> 59:18.880
great prop comedy you can rest assured that somewhere in there they've inhaled a little

59:18.880 --> 59:23.520
bit of travis okay but what if instead of being cremated it was just my body

59:27.360 --> 59:34.000
gallagher got fucking edgy it is like fuck he walked out of really don't want to sit in the

59:34.000 --> 59:42.080
front row like for real he walked out of marin and off the off the deep end and now he smashed

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:12.000
seeing justin still alive he found the crystal skull so he's still so he's still going

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.280
gallagher would too that's the worst thing about it about this imaginary situation gallagher totally

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:28.320
would he didn't give a shit well he's not allowed to say no if you if you give him 30 he has to

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.840

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:55.120
we wanted to find a way to find out what the max fun community thinks about our shows so we started

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.800
something called the max fun listener panel basically you subscribe to a podcast feed and

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.560
twice a month or so roughly speaking we'll send you an episode of a show and instructions on how

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:13.120
to fill out a quick survey about what you think about that show 10 questions nothing too crazy

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.520
you'll be hearing existing shows that we're thinking about making changes to secret pilots

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:24.080
of shows that we're developing that you'll only hear this way shows we're considering adding to

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:31.760
the network and what you think about them really matters to us so to join the panel is easy just

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:41.280
