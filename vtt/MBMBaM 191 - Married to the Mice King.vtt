00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.320
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.320 --> 01:00.000
I'm your babiest thought thinker, social guru, baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.200
Griffin, uh, this week is at the South X South W festival. Six was six.

01:11.200 --> 01:20.160
I'm not exactly sure. It is a festival that was created by a race of alien locusts people.

01:20.160 --> 01:24.640
And so it's been the proper pronunciation and not a lot of people get this. Not a lot of the tech

01:24.640 --> 01:31.440
uh, thought thinker gurus here get that it's actually pronounced. Quick question. When people

01:31.440 --> 01:37.840
refer to themselves as thought thinker gurus, are they expelled from the conference? Uh,

01:37.840 --> 01:41.520
they are admitted. That's actually when you pick up your badge, they say, we got to take

01:41.520 --> 01:45.680
a profile pic for our social site. And then you take a profile pic for the social site.

01:45.680 --> 01:51.360
And then they say, what's your position? You say, I'm a writer for a video game website. And they

01:51.360 --> 01:56.320
go, Ooh, close, but no cigar. You go, Oh no, no, I'm shit. Sorry. I'm a thought thinker guru.

01:56.320 --> 02:02.560
They're like, okay, come on in. Come on in and disrupt this shit. Promise me this week, Griffin,

02:02.560 --> 02:07.520
when you get the person with the worst job title on their business card, something along the lines

02:07.520 --> 02:16.480
of social media professor or ninja of tweets, master of Twitter foo, master of Twitter foo.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.800
You take the card and then while they look on in horror, you just slowly eat it,

02:22.800 --> 02:26.560
never breaking eye contact with them. And then ask for a second, then ask.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.640
The problem is that a lot of these business cards aren't actually business cards. Sometimes

02:32.640 --> 02:36.400
they're jump drives. Sometimes they're bracelets. Sometimes they're actually they're Twitter

02:36.400 --> 02:41.840
accounts. Sometimes they're rice crackers. People will just create bespoke Twitter accounts

02:41.840 --> 02:47.040
and then hand those out as their business cards. Just to really hit the drive, the point home that

02:47.040 --> 02:52.080
they're thought thinkers. That's okay. Maybe a slap bracelet would be the way to go. You goof,

02:52.080 --> 02:57.440
but I Garen goddamn T it. If I walked down dirty six long enough, someone will just like,

02:57.440 --> 03:02.960
I'm walking down the street and someone will be like brand cuffs right there on me. I'm sorry.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.520
Did you say brand cuffs? God, Travis, it's like you're living in fucking 2011.

03:07.520 --> 03:16.640
Yeah. Uh, South by Southwest. Is it, is it about music? I really don't know. It's a, it's a lot of

03:16.640 --> 03:21.040
things about armadillos and music and people playing armadillos to create music. That's exactly

03:21.040 --> 03:26.080
right. Or turning them like stomp or turning armadillos or pressing their shells down and

03:26.080 --> 03:30.640
turning them into film. That's the, all the film that gets made here and debuted here,

03:30.640 --> 03:35.760
like the Veronica Mars movie debuted last night was printed on armadillo. It gets,

03:35.760 --> 03:44.480
you get a really nice quality. Um, if you, if you haven't seen a apocalypse now on 35 millimeter

03:44.480 --> 03:49.360
armadillo skin, then you just haven't seen the film. You just haven't seen it. Do you

03:49.360 --> 03:54.240
do much star spotting at South by Southwest? Is it, is it an opportunity to spot some,

03:54.240 --> 03:58.560
some celebs? No, I spent all my time at the gaming side of it, which is like,

03:58.560 --> 04:02.160
Oh God, well forget about it. I don't have any celebrities. They keep it across,

04:02.160 --> 04:06.560
across the river from where all the thought thinkers are. I'm sure Norris

04:06.560 --> 04:11.040
plays world of warcraft. Was he there? Uh, he doesn't and he wasn't and he can't.

04:11.040 --> 04:15.440
Mr. T does. He doesn't. And he wouldn't, he wouldn't. And he shouldn't. And he

04:15.440 --> 04:21.040
don't. And he can't. He's on the commercials and he plays. Is that Mario's nephew, Daniel?

04:21.040 --> 04:27.840
Is that Daniel Mario? That's his last name. Yeah, their last name is Mario. Um, no, it's a,

04:27.840 --> 04:32.880
it's, it's a bunch of different festivals all rolled into one and it's, um, I'm not as like

04:32.880 --> 04:40.240
jaded about it as literally every other Austinite is. Um, but it does make it, it does, I mean,

04:40.240 --> 04:47.440
it does disrupt my taco eating because it's, well, it's all about disruptive media. They definitely

04:47.440 --> 04:52.560
fucking get in there and they disrupt the line by which I mean, they make it quintuple the normal

04:52.560 --> 05:00.400
line for tacos. Did you just go to Taco Bell? I just go to Taco Bell. I goofed about that

05:00.400 --> 05:05.440
on Twitter. I was like, Hey guys, come to Austin for tacos. Just go to Taco Bell. There's a reason

05:05.440 --> 05:11.600
why it's so popular. And then Taco Bell fucking responded on Twitter. God, nice. They were like,

05:11.600 --> 05:16.000
not cool, Griffin. You could kind of hurt our feelings with that one. Of all the professional

05:16.720 --> 05:20.800
relationships for you to jeopardize, you have to go and jeopardize a relationship with Taco Bell.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.240
I know they'll, they fucking locked me out. Where am I supposed to get my fourth meal now?

05:24.240 --> 05:31.040
Jack in the box? No, thanks. They do have tacos there and spaghetti.

05:33.440 --> 05:38.320
That's troubling and steak. And you can do your taxes and you can do your taxes at choppy.

05:39.040 --> 05:44.160
Uh, let's help people. I I'm done with this disruptive technology. It's been disruptive

05:44.160 --> 05:50.560
to our show long enough. Uh, that said, Griffin, if you do spot any stars like during the recording,

05:50.560 --> 05:56.560
please let me know if they walk into my office. Yeah. Or walk past your window. This is the real

05:56.560 --> 06:02.800
Austin. I'm looking at two stars right now. My brothers. Uh, who? Cause you can't see us.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.840
Kristen Bell and doc Shepherd. Okay. Cool. They stopped by. I was going to say,

06:07.840 --> 06:11.280
if you're still seeing stars outside and you forgot to set your clock forward.

06:11.280 --> 06:16.960
Ah, that's your problem, not mine. That's not how daylight savings. That isn't how time works.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.200
What are you talking about? Hello, but yeah, it's called a great joke

06:22.560 --> 06:29.440
for the show. I don't actually prefer that you don't do those anymore. Don't do great jokes.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.000
Just, I mean, just say what you mean from now on. I'm done with jokes on this show. They're just

06:34.000 --> 06:40.160
like silly, you know, some of our jokes are just like goofy, you know, I want to go back to that

06:40.160 --> 06:48.800
old school joke. That high brow Dax Shepard shit. I'm on that. Talked about that. I'm on that Dax.

06:52.720 --> 07:00.080
See, that's just silly. I'm on that Dax. I need, I want a joke on the show. I need jokes,

07:00.080 --> 07:07.280
but set up punchline. Dax. Set up. What do you call a Dax Shepard? See, this is good, Travis.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.840
I don't know. What do you call a Dax? Well, I mean, presumably Dax Shepard. You call him Dax

07:11.840 --> 07:16.160
Shepard. Okay. Cause that's his goddamn name. See, that had a set up and it had a punchline,

07:16.160 --> 07:20.800
but it was a little lacking in the Dax department. If we're talking about basic joke construction.

07:20.800 --> 07:28.640
Okay. Griffin, Dax, Dax, Dax, Dax, Dax, Dax. Again, you were sort of deficient. Fuck me.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.640
Hello brothers. My boyfriend and I have been together almost a year now. And I feel like

07:34.640 --> 07:40.400
the fresh buzz of the honeymoon phase is starting to wear off. Is he listening? Put him in front of

07:40.400 --> 07:45.440
the radio. Don't get me wrong. I still very much love him and cannot consider a life without him,

07:45.440 --> 07:51.040
nor do I want to. It's just hard when I see friends or coworkers starting, starting cute,

07:51.040 --> 07:56.560
new relationships. And I feel myself missing the unique twangs of new love. This is my first

07:56.560 --> 08:03.120
relationship that's ever stuck. So I've never encountered this feeling before. What can I do?

08:03.120 --> 08:06.560
That's from wistful on the West coast. And it is not a bad question.

08:06.560 --> 08:12.560
No. And I'm, I'm very glad that that last, um, sort of interjection about this being the first

08:12.560 --> 08:19.520
like long relationship because like, um, yeah, like that happens with your first long relationship.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.920
I feel like, and it's not, I don't think it's something that it really is part of the territory

08:23.920 --> 08:29.360
once you've been, um, in a couple of these bad boys. Yeah. And I think that what you're feeling

08:29.360 --> 08:37.440
is complete, completely normal. Sure. Like here's the thing. Look like what you're seeing is the

08:37.440 --> 08:42.960
cute new relationships. What you're not seeing is all the single people desperately trying to

08:42.960 --> 08:48.320
connect with another human being all the shitty new relationships that are starting all of the

08:48.320 --> 08:52.960
problems and fights and awkward breakups and trying to tell someone that the first date didn't

08:52.960 --> 08:59.680
work out all of that, you know, all of the baggage and even worse that like the fifth date didn't

08:59.680 --> 09:06.560
work out. And that's like, I, I went through a period where I like had a lot of those sort of

09:06.560 --> 09:12.080
like one to two month long relationships and it sucked every single time because like you get your

09:12.080 --> 09:16.000
own hopes up, you get the other person's hopes up. And then when you realize like that, it's not

09:16.000 --> 09:22.480
going to work out. Like that's the, that is like seriously in all of my days and all the things I've

09:22.480 --> 09:28.160
experienced that, that is like the shittiest feeling in the entire world. And like to me,

09:28.160 --> 09:34.640
once you find that right person that you love being with and you, you quote, can't like consider

09:34.640 --> 09:40.080
your life without like that is a blessing because you don't have to deal with that other shit

09:40.080 --> 09:46.880
anymore. So here's what you do. You vampire it. Oh boy. No, no, no. Cause here's what I mean.

09:48.080 --> 09:54.960
You need to then you and your partner hang out with these new young couples and just kind of

09:54.960 --> 10:00.480
feed off their like little looks between the two of you and little handholds when it's like, I

10:00.480 --> 10:06.640
remember when we were like that and you get that little like tiny burst of that new cute feeling.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.880
And then you go back to your house where you already know each other well enough that you

10:10.880 --> 10:18.960
don't have to deal with each other's bullshit. I need you at home to remember that cute new

10:18.960 --> 10:24.080
relationship stuff. And this is going to sound cynical, but it isn't. It's your body. It's your

10:24.080 --> 10:31.280
like body chemistry way of trying to trick you into procreating and deep down in your heart,

10:31.280 --> 10:38.320
beneath your soul, there is a little, um, man who just wants you. He's like a dirty guy. He's like,

10:38.320 --> 10:42.880
just do it. Cause he wants you to procreate and spread your species. It's a deepest,

10:42.880 --> 10:47.200
most primal impulse you have. His name is Charles Darwin and he's a dirty bird. It's

10:47.200 --> 10:52.240
Charles Darwin. He lives in your heart and he's a dirty bird cause he wants you to just do it. Skip

10:52.240 --> 10:59.680
all this relationship stuff. Just do it. Spread the virus of humanity. This feeling that this new

10:59.680 --> 11:07.600
relationship feeling is really just like a, it's like a no interest loan to get you in to and

11:07.600 --> 11:14.160
custom, uh, relationship car. It's there, there you're, it's just a way to suck you in. It suckers

11:14.160 --> 11:20.320
you in. And then the important stuff is the fact that you have a friend and somebody who

11:21.120 --> 11:25.680
supports you and somebody you care a lot about and somebody who's a great match for you.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.960
And a lot of that like new relationship stuff doesn't have to worry about any of that. Like

11:30.960 --> 11:37.280
it's a, you're free wheeling like, so yeah, it's, it's, it's, um, cute, but it's also

11:37.280 --> 11:41.040
insubstantial, right? You know, because it doesn't, you, it doesn't have the bedrock.

11:41.040 --> 11:47.200
It doesn't have anything built underneath it. And I, and I can understand the, the missing that

11:47.200 --> 11:56.400
feeling, but like two things. First off, don't, I have known so many people who have traded in really

11:56.400 --> 12:03.120
great relationships for a taste of that feeling again. Um, and, and, and that's not to say that

12:03.120 --> 12:10.400
I don't feel like romantic love towards my wife every single day and, and find a new reason why,

12:10.400 --> 12:16.400
uh, I love her more than anything. Listen, she cut, listen to the show. I got to cover my fucking

12:16.400 --> 12:23.360
bases. When you've been married seven years, Justin said, I mean it too for mine. I love my wife more

12:23.360 --> 12:29.840
and more every day. Like all the grains in the, of sand, that's where she carried you. Anyway, I,

12:31.120 --> 12:35.760
I've seen people trade in great relationships for a taste of that feeling. You got to remember that

12:35.760 --> 12:42.240
once you get to be my age, the number of feelings that you won't feel anymore from youth pile up so

12:42.240 --> 12:47.600
much that that one's just another one for the sack. Just throw it on the fire. I don't remember,

12:47.600 --> 12:52.320
there's a lot of things I used to feel that I don't feel anymore because I'm old. I'm an old

12:52.320 --> 12:56.960
man. I know it's not, that's the, you'll trust, you'll just get lost in the shuffle, but I think

12:56.960 --> 13:02.880
it could be a really destructive, it could be a really destructive impulse. Um, another, and this,

13:02.880 --> 13:07.840
and you know, this is going to get into like boring, like normal relationship advice crap,

13:07.840 --> 13:13.280
so I won't dwell on it, but, uh, a great way to sort of get a semblance of this feeling about

13:13.280 --> 13:18.960
back is to put you and your significant other into a new relationship. I mean, I think we've

13:18.960 --> 13:24.160
seen it time and time again, perhaps in Steve Carell vehicle date night, when you're thrust into

13:24.160 --> 13:29.760
a unfamiliar circumstance, you discover new stuff about the person you're with and something like

13:29.760 --> 13:36.800
that is, is, is, uh, you know, sort of what that new relationship smell is generating.

13:36.800 --> 13:42.800
You always got to find his one weakness. You always got to pick on his one fucking slip up

13:43.680 --> 13:47.920
and never, I'm talking about you, Justin, and your relationship with Steve Carell.

13:48.480 --> 13:54.400
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I accidentally bring up, uh, the incredible Burt Wonderstone?

13:54.400 --> 13:58.160
Also, you are always writing his, even his fucking grill.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.560
B stringers are better than most people's A material.

14:00.560 --> 14:06.080
You've got a fucking timeshare in Steve, Steve Carell's grill and it's fucking shameful. What

14:06.080 --> 14:14.880
have you done? You know what I mean? Did you, I mean, did, did you see Evan Almighty? I mean,

14:14.880 --> 14:20.000
did you, I watched it on a plane. It gave me diarrhea guys. We kick stuff off. It looked

14:20.000 --> 14:26.240
like full blown Dr. Rue style. I don't know if that's the pace that we usually, I got Dr. I

14:26.240 --> 14:32.480
hope that helped. I watched the, we watched the episode of quantum leap yesterday in season five,

14:32.480 --> 14:38.320
I think like ep eight where Sam Beckett jumps into Dr. Ruth. This is not a joke. This is an

14:38.320 --> 14:45.600
actual episode of quantum leap. Um, it is the craziest hour of television I think I've ever

14:45.600 --> 14:50.000
watched in my entire life because Dr. Ruth is an imaging chamber hanging out with Al Calvici in

14:50.000 --> 14:55.360
real life and like helping him deal with his sexual childishness, let's call it.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.400
And there's like a full quantum leap, just like jump the shark episode two.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.680
Yeah. And then it just stayed, it hovered over the shark like Chris Angel mind freak the entire

15:05.680 --> 15:10.320
time. There's like a two minute segment where they're dealing with the fact that Al Calvici

15:10.320 --> 15:15.520
can't say the word breasts because he's such a sexual child. And instead he has to say like

15:15.520 --> 15:24.480
bazongas, balloons, beepers, boppos, weep, weeps, Jim Jim's slappers. And that episode one, two

15:24.480 --> 15:32.160
Emmys for best boobs, best nicknames for breasts by Al Calvici. Wow. Train wreck.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.720
Is that on Netflix? It's on Netflix and it's on Hulu. You're going to want to watch it on Hulu

15:36.720 --> 15:41.120
because they don't have all the episodes on Netflix, including the one where Sam leaps

15:41.120 --> 15:49.200
into Lee Harvey Oswald. That's the best. It's the fucking best. You guys want Yahoo? Yeah. Thanks

15:49.200 --> 15:52.960
everybody for sending in your Yahoo's. We burned through a lot of them because we did the, uh,

15:52.960 --> 15:58.080
we did the bonus episode with our dad, which you can listen to now if you are a donor. Uh,

15:58.080 --> 16:01.760
and if you're not, you're about to be cause we're kicking off the max fun drive next week. Uh,

16:01.760 --> 16:08.080
more deets on that soon. Uh, but this Yahoo was sent in by, uh, Amelie Belcher. Thanks Amelie.

16:08.080 --> 16:14.880
It's by Yahoo answers user. What was that? It's right next to the Amelie from the movie Amelie.

16:14.880 --> 16:24.240
Amelie. Cause she just walks around in person. You just, it's about a young girl who can only

16:24.240 --> 16:32.880
say her own name. I cook an egg with a spoon. Amelie. Jesus. She cooks an egg with a spoon.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.720
Fall in love again with me. Amelie. Now on DVD.

16:36.720 --> 16:45.600
You missed that new relationships, but maybe fall in love with me. Don't look for me on

16:45.600 --> 16:53.120
Blu-ray. I'm not on Blu-ray. I'm on my DVD. I'm too small to fit on the Blu-ray. They lose me.

16:53.120 --> 16:59.200
I am Amelie. I'm hiding near the spindle. I am Amelie.

16:59.200 --> 17:09.440
I'm hiding near the spindle. I am Amelie. This laser disc is gigantic. I am on the edge of it.

17:10.560 --> 17:19.360
Hello. It is like a plate for my egg dinner. Delicious. I am Amelie.

17:19.360 --> 17:27.040
I am inside your pocket. You have enough money to buy my DVD.

17:27.040 --> 17:32.000
You have to stop or it'll be the whole show.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.080
I'm in VHS tapes because I would get in the little holes and spin around.

17:38.080 --> 17:42.080
Is Amelie a borrower? What's going on?

17:42.080 --> 17:51.680
Yes, I live in a home with a mice king. I'm married to the mice king. My staff is a lollipop, Amelie.

17:54.560 --> 18:03.920
Thank you. Oh, Christ. Give me a second. All right. Thank you, Amelie Belcher. This is by

18:03.920 --> 18:12.400
Yahoo Answers user Erica, who asks, I want to give up Taco Bell for Lint.

18:15.040 --> 18:21.600
For Kent, nice start. I was thinking about giving up Taco Bell since I am obsessed with it.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.520
But I ate Taco Bell on Ash Wednesday, then later that night decided to give it up.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.880
But since I decided after, does it still count or should I give up something else?

18:28.880 --> 18:33.920
You have to double give it up. Now, how would that happen?

18:33.920 --> 18:37.200
You have to give it up and then steal it from someone else and throw it away.

18:37.200 --> 18:42.480
Oh, but that's just thievery. It's not. Yeah, you got to rob and hood the Taco Bell.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.040
You got to rob from the rich and give to the garbage.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.480
Travis, the problem with your plan is that it's not very sustainable.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.000
How's that? We're good.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
If you want to be the top, first of all, taco burglar, you're going to get in.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.360
A pretty serious trademark dispute with McDonald's.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.520
What about the gordita grabber?

19:05.520 --> 19:08.880
Gordita grabber. Yeah, sure. That's totally kosher.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.960
Gordito bandito.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.720
Can someone explain to me Lint?

19:18.720 --> 19:22.640
You give stuff up and you feel bad because Jesus gave stuff up.

19:22.640 --> 19:26.800
You give stuff up and you feel bad because Jesus gave stuff up.

19:26.800 --> 19:33.600
I know that there's a shit ton of places that do fish. They get super fish.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.840
I think BK is running some ads now where it's like,

19:37.840 --> 19:42.160
we got all the fish sandwiches your Catholic mouth can possibly eat.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.480
So is it while Lint is going on, you're also not supposed to eat meat and only fish?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.520
Because if that's the case, then yeah, Taco Bell, probably not for you.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.200
I do not think they have.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.400
It's on Fridays. You're just supposed to eat fish, fish Fridays.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.680
On Lint or across the calendar?

20:00.720 --> 20:01.680
No, that I do not know.

20:02.880 --> 20:09.680
No, just during Lint, you're not supposed to eat serious meat on Fridays, I think.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.240
If I'm not mistaken, that is because back in the day,

20:15.040 --> 20:21.440
England had this huge surplus of fish and they needed to keep their fish.

20:21.440 --> 20:25.920
I'm not even joking that they're fishing, but I know you're not joking.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.120
That's what makes it funny is that our world is the fucking dumbest.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.280
Fishing boats were also the Navy and they had to keep the fishing boats employed

20:33.280 --> 20:35.440
so they could keep their Navy afloat.

20:35.440 --> 20:40.320
So it's your old pal Sal Pescalito, your local fisherman.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.440
Hey, I just found a new missing page of the Bible.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.960
Like I found it blown around in the street like Bart's nightmare.

20:46.960 --> 20:52.240
Let me tell you, it says that Jesus loves fish on Fridays.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.200
Huge fan.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.640
Huge, huge fan.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.480
Trust me, I'm Sal Pescalito.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.960
I remembered my name from when I said it a minute ago.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.720
Which is really the greatest feat Griffin McElroy's ever done on this show.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.680
It's a Lint miracle.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.400
I've been waiting to reference Bart's nightmare for three years now.

21:10.400 --> 21:16.240
And that is the series finale of My Brother, My Brother and Me.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.160
Okay, Taco Bell.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.360
I mean, here's the thing.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.800
Here's a little Lint secret.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.320
Have you guys ever given anything up for Lint?

21:24.320 --> 21:25.760
Can we address that first and foremost?

21:25.760 --> 21:27.600
Maybe in high school and all your friends were doing it.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.480
We don't do Lint.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.840
No, I know, but like you didn't like all your friends were doing it in high school.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.640
You were like, you know what?

21:32.640 --> 21:33.360
I am too.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.320
In college, we gave up fast food, but that was like a more of like an excuse for weight

21:38.320 --> 21:41.520
loss thing more than it was any kind of religious.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.880
And then what we did is we did not eat fast food for 40 days.

21:44.880 --> 21:49.600
And then on the 41st day, fucking took it to everything.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.960
We drove an hour and a half to the closest Jack in the box and like just loaded up the

21:54.960 --> 22:01.600
vehicle with fast food, drove home and had like a three hour feast of fast food.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.720
And then we all died.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.240
Yeah, now it tries to go.

22:04.240 --> 22:10.960
So if you're going to do a Lint thing and you really want to do it for a month and some

22:10.960 --> 22:16.080
change, then it's got to be something you can realistically go without for a month and

22:16.080 --> 22:16.560
some change.

22:16.560 --> 22:20.640
So in that regard, don't, I don't think this is a good idea because of course you're

22:20.640 --> 22:21.600
going to eat Taco Bell.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.320
You have to, you'll die.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.600
You'll die if you don't.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.600
I think if your special thing that you gave up for Lint to really prove your devotion

22:29.600 --> 22:32.320
to the big guy is Taco Bell.

22:32.320 --> 22:37.520
He is already so thoroughly unimpressed with you that like he's not going to get out the

22:37.520 --> 22:39.040
calendar and double check you.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.400
Yeah, it's fine.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.920
You're trying your best.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.920
You clearly, you know, are giving it your best shot.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.800
Do you say you're going to give something up for Lint?

22:48.800 --> 22:49.760
What would it be?

22:49.760 --> 22:50.320
It's odd.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.360
It has been so obvious to me since the very beginning.

22:55.360 --> 23:00.400
There is only one thing that makes sense to give up for Lint and that's candy because

23:00.400 --> 23:02.480
it ends on Easter.

23:02.480 --> 23:08.080
Oh, so you are just, oh, like you're, you have preserved your candy virginity.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.680
You are like the taste of the succulent taste.

23:11.680 --> 23:11.920
What?

23:11.920 --> 23:12.720
You're washed.

23:12.720 --> 23:15.760
I mean, you're washed clean and you're born again.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.800
Candy virginity.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.360
It's your second chance at candy virginity.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.240
Patched your candy.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.840
Your second gummy cherry.

23:21.840 --> 23:22.800
Oh, yes.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.280
Thank you.

23:23.280 --> 23:31.280
And then once that big, beautiful bunny comes to your house and leaves you with that

23:31.280 --> 23:35.760
treasure, he takes your candy virginity.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.960
It is going to be the best candy you've ever eaten.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.680
And God is going to be like, you see, you did it.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.680
I got you back and I'm so proud.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.120
I invented jelly beans.

23:47.520 --> 23:51.280
The intent was always for people to give up candy for Lint.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.080
That's always what God intended for you to give up.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.240
That's why he made the Easter bunny from Adam's foot.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.760
Did they have, wow.

23:59.760 --> 24:04.080
That's, that's a hundred percent biblical scholar Justin McElroy.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.600
I think, did they have candy back in Bethlehem days?

24:08.320 --> 24:09.600
Yeah, it was probably shitty.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.360
It was like dried salted fish.

24:11.360 --> 24:16.400
I was going to say, yeah, it's like figs that they tried to jam in the shape of gummy bears.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.840
Like, hey kids, we invented candy.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.560
No, you didn't.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.640
Don't try to get ahead of me.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.200
I know I'm only 10, but that's, I know a fig when I see one.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.280
It's like one of two foods that we had.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.160
It's figs and bread.

24:27.040 --> 24:27.680
That's all we got.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.160
We haven't even figured out how you can eat the fish yet.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.760
What a great day that's going to be.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.880
Only on Fridays though.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.480
Friday sucked dick.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.440
Friday sucked dick.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.720
We can't eat anything.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.600
I think back in those days, I think back in those days, like the sacrifices were so much,

24:43.600 --> 24:45.360
like I gave up furniture.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.880
I gave up furniture for Lint.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.160
I gave up standing up.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.280
You only had like six things that you could do.

24:51.280 --> 24:56.560
You had furniture, dates, bread, cocaine.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.280
Your habit of trying to figure out a way to eat fish.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.400
Yeah, I don't know.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.840
Your obsession with the pursuit of edible fish.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.400
Just grab the head and the tail and just bite it somewhere.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.200
I don't know.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.760
Why does it have this armor on the outside of it?

25:09.760 --> 25:10.800
These are disgusting.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.640
I gave up scorpions.

25:14.640 --> 25:21.360
There are not a lot of foods that so willfully try to dissuade you from eating them.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.280
You think about fish for a second.

25:23.280 --> 25:30.560
Fish is covered in inedible, hard to remove little pieces of chitin.

25:30.560 --> 25:38.080
And then once you get inside and finally find the meat, it's got razor sharp tiny thin bones.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.040
That are invisible.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.320
Invisible to the human eye.

25:40.320 --> 25:46.080
If there's ever been a clear signal that we're not supposed to eat that, I don't know what it is.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.760
Maybe the blowfish that has the poison in it.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.640
That was that was one that Jeezu like really tried.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.720
Like guys, get the fucking net.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.080
Get it.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.760
You're not supposed to eat these.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.920
But on Friday the poison is nullified.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.880
I don't know if you knew that.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.400
Every Friday, Fugu Friday.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.000
Just like swallow it whole, baby.

26:04.880 --> 26:05.440
Let it roll.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.120
I think I might have made that thing up about the English.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.520
Fish and the fish.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.480
Swallow it whole.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.440
Let it roll.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.240
Catholicism.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.360
Another question.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.000
It's a new religion.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.800
Give it another.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.920
I need another question.

26:17.920 --> 26:23.600
I'm 22 and I've been working in a manufacturing plant for about six months.

26:23.600 --> 26:27.520
It's not a terrible job, but it is not what I want to be doing with my whole life.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.080
I have dreams of being a stand-up comedian.

26:30.720 --> 26:34.960
I know it takes a really long time to get to a point where I can support myself solely doing

26:34.960 --> 26:35.680
stand-up.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.200
If I ever get to that point at all.

26:37.200 --> 26:42.560
Brothers, how do I keep myself motivated at my current job while simultaneously pursuing

26:42.560 --> 26:43.280
my dream?

26:45.040 --> 26:46.480
Ambitious in Ohio.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.960
Roman Mars gave me some amazing advice recently.

26:51.840 --> 26:55.840
And I said that, you know, I was interested in doing like sketch comedy, but I felt like

26:55.840 --> 26:56.560
I was too old.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.520
And I said, how old is too old?

26:59.520 --> 27:03.920
And he said, do you know how old you'll be when you're successful at it?

27:03.920 --> 27:06.160
The same age you'll be if you don't try.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.480
And it's like, okay, excellent point.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.160
It's like that idea of like.

27:10.160 --> 27:14.880
That dude is like, everything he says is super on point.

27:14.880 --> 27:15.520
Yeah.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.680
Can you imagine if like one of us were like that?

27:17.680 --> 27:19.520
Like how much better this show would be?

27:19.520 --> 27:20.480
It would be really good.

27:21.120 --> 27:25.920
When he's, when he said, like when you read that, did you hear like an ambient soundscape

27:25.920 --> 27:26.880
behind his words?

27:26.880 --> 27:30.240
Cause like, I don't think I could talk when I, when I saw him at max fun con, I couldn't

27:30.240 --> 27:35.280
talk to him unless I started some sort of a lovely ambient soundscape.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.360
He actually just carries a tablet with him.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.800
That's full of ambient sounds.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.760
And just when you start talking, he's like, hold up a finger.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.120
He's like, hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.400
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.200
And he hits you.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.000
You hear like, man, you're.

27:46.000 --> 27:52.320
99% invisible.

27:56.960 --> 27:57.840
He's a robot.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.720
Now what he's at.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.000
Roman Mars is also a robot.

28:00.000 --> 28:09.040
Uh, now the, uh, the question is not whether I should try what he's saying is how does

28:09.040 --> 28:16.000
he stay motivated in his current job while pursuing his dream while pursuing his dream?

28:16.000 --> 28:20.720
You know, the thing is, I think the thing is though, like you can always find like,

28:20.720 --> 28:23.680
I'm sure there's an open mic night somewhere near you, you know?

28:23.680 --> 28:27.360
And if nothing else, when you're at work, write jokes in your head, you know what I

28:27.360 --> 28:27.600
mean?

28:27.600 --> 28:32.480
And then write them down on your break and then do what Steve Martin did and stand in

28:32.480 --> 28:36.640
front of your mirror for hours on end and practice your jokes and hone your craft and

28:37.360 --> 28:38.560
figure out the best delivery.

28:38.560 --> 28:45.920
And you know, I tell you what, the only thing that ever kept me, uh, invested in like, uh,

28:48.320 --> 28:53.760
non mentally taxing gigs, let's say that, uh, the only thing that ever kept me invested.

28:53.760 --> 29:00.560
And this is a good lesson for like, um, people who run a business too and have their own

29:00.560 --> 29:01.440
employees.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.760
The only thing that ever kept me invested was ownership.

29:03.760 --> 29:10.160
Um, when I would be given ownership of something, whatever it was, that was something that would

29:10.800 --> 29:13.840
invest me a lot more into the gig.

29:13.840 --> 29:18.880
So like when I was working at Best Buy, for example, I would try to sell karaoke machines

29:18.880 --> 29:27.280
by, uh, doing karaoke there to the delight, I assume, of all the customers.

29:27.280 --> 29:31.440
Uh, and you know, everybody would take a turn and it was fun, but it was my project.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.960
It was something I came up with.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.800
We only had like two machines for sale.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.880
I'm pretty sure we never sold any, but I-

29:36.880 --> 29:39.040
So not a great thing you did.

29:39.040 --> 29:44.480
So when you say you tried, what you mean is you didn't try killing time by jerking off

29:44.480 --> 29:45.760
with a karaoke machine.

29:45.760 --> 29:52.320
No, it's less about the, it's less about the impact on sales and more about the impact

29:52.320 --> 29:56.880
on myself as an employee because I felt more invested in my gig because I had ownership

29:56.880 --> 29:57.120
of something.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.800
But you weren't doing anything.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.480
You were just singing karaoke.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.280
You weren't selling the machines.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.240
That wasn't the only part of my job that was impacted.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.560
My whole attitude towards the gig changed.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.840
And I would take on other, like just decide this is your section.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.600
This is the thing that you're going to crush and you're going to be responsible for it.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.160
It's your baby.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.200
And it's not juice, can I tell you?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.560
It sounds like you really killed it.

30:17.120 --> 30:17.920
Thanks Griffin.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.840
I think I did a really good job.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.560
Those were, those are not high margin items anyway.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.560
Selling one wouldn't have made that big of an impact.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.080
This guy works in manufacturing though, which I think is like a gig that is specifically

30:28.080 --> 30:33.920
designed to crush those kinds of feelings with like an iron Orwellian fist.

30:33.920 --> 30:39.040
Like I'm taking charge of this one nut that I put on this one door.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.520
Then you do something that is not related to your job.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.120
Take it, start a softball team, take ownership of it.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.320
Buy a ping pong table.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.760
Don't buy a ping pong table.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.800
How about take ownership of your stand up comedy career?

30:51.440 --> 30:56.960
He's asking about, listen, Travis, if you one more time try to tell this guy how to

30:56.960 --> 31:01.040
pursue a stand up comedy career when that is not his problem, I'm going to find someone

31:01.040 --> 31:02.720
who's better at advice than you.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.600
Let me throw this out.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.520
I hate having to throw that out there on you.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.160
I understand.

31:06.160 --> 31:06.800
Good luck.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.120
Let me throw this out.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.800
Open the door, yell outside.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.560
Anyone want to tell me what to do?

31:12.560 --> 31:13.840
Like, yep, I got you.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.560
I got you.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
What if you set up a reward system?

31:17.360 --> 31:18.000
Cookie points.

31:18.800 --> 31:25.200
Yeah, more or less where you say like, every time I save $100 from my manufacturing job,

31:25.920 --> 31:28.640
I'll take myself out to dinner.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.000
I'll go see a stand up comedy show.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.480
I'll rent a movie, whatever.

31:34.480 --> 31:38.320
But just something that makes it more than just the drudgery of work.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.520
Something that feels like you're building towards a goal.

31:41.520 --> 31:44.320
Yeah, I mean, that is good advice, actually.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.160
Oh, damn it.

31:46.160 --> 31:46.400
Yeah.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.280
All right, you're back.

31:47.280 --> 31:47.920
You're back on.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.040
Yeah, I did it.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.520
Call my, now here's how you pursue your stand up comedy.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.240
God damn it.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.520
No, wait, no.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.080
I blew it.

31:54.080 --> 31:54.800
I blew it.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.400
Hello, brothers.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.800
In a few months, I am moving in with some friends of mine.

31:58.800 --> 32:04.480
They already have three housemates, a couple and the lady in the couple's little brother.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.120
Yes.

32:05.120 --> 32:08.400
No, that sentence made sense to the people who heard it, but not to the person who said

32:08.400 --> 32:08.880
it out loud.

32:08.880 --> 32:13.680
Okay, a couple and the lady in the couple's little brother.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.440
It's the couple and one of their little brothers.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.760
Oh, the lady.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.480
Okay, got it.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.280
All right, got it.

32:20.080 --> 32:26.400
The couple is going to India for five months, and the little brother is going to go to Thailand.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.600
Did you almost say Thailand?

32:28.160 --> 32:28.320
No.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.920
You're like Anthony Bourdain.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.360
So world smart.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.720
You're so savvy.

32:39.600 --> 32:44.240
How do my friends and I tell the travelers that at least one of them will be essentially

32:44.240 --> 32:45.760
homeless when they return?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.520
That's for moving in Melbourne.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.160
I don't understand.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.440
Just let them get home.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.320
Let them walk in.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.120
Your shit's there.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.440
In a few months, you're moving in with some friends.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.520
They already have three housemates.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.560
The couple and the brother are leaving.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.320
How did your friends tell the travelers that?

33:01.280 --> 33:02.560
I don't understand.

33:02.560 --> 33:08.720
Are you it seems to me that they're moving to India for five months and this dude's like

33:08.720 --> 33:12.080
creep sneaking in to take over one of their rooms while they're gone.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.400
Okay, so like that's probably not legal.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.360
I don't fucking understand.

33:15.360 --> 33:20.240
You can't just like you don't have squatters rights if like somebody lives there already.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.880
Like if they don't know that they're not going to have a house when they get back,

33:22.880 --> 33:24.560
what the fuck are you talking about?

33:24.560 --> 33:27.520
Well, that's why they're trying to that's why they're trying to figure out how to tell them.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.440
How crazy is it in Melbourne?

33:29.440 --> 33:35.680
Like is it just a sort of a outlaw sort of system where if somebody if you leave your house

33:35.680 --> 33:38.080
and somebody else rolls into your house, that's their house.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.880
Okay, let's mathematically let's bust this down.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.280
Okay, a few months moving in with some friends of mine.

33:43.280 --> 33:48.400
So we can assume that the non moving parties are more than one person will say it's two people.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.400
They have three housemates is a big ass house.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.600
It's got five people in it.

33:51.600 --> 33:55.120
Three of the housemates are leaving for a period of time and then when they return.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.640
They're not going to have a place to live anymore because you're moving into their house.

33:58.640 --> 34:04.160
It sounds like depending on how many friends you have in that house,

34:04.720 --> 34:07.280
you are evicting a majority share of the house.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.000
And that's just not how like anything works.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.560
You can't kick out a majority of the people in the house against their will.

34:14.560 --> 34:19.600
I don't think this is like you can't just like fucking.

34:19.600 --> 34:26.800
I think what he's saying is if one or I mean,

34:26.800 --> 34:31.840
either the brother or presumably the couple isn't going to split so.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.080
Ooh, make them choose.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.720
Are you saying get some pool cues, snap them over your knee,

34:39.600 --> 34:44.480
throw them to him and say one of you will be evicted.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.320
Why do you say like that?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.560
Oh, that's your that's your Australian accent.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.040
Yeah, not good.

34:51.040 --> 34:51.600
Not good.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.160
Not great.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.080
Throw another shrimp on the bar.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.200
Terrific.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.080
Fantastic.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.440
Bye Australia.

34:57.440 --> 34:58.480
Hey Australia.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.840
Thanks for listening and supporting.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.720
Oh, they know.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.920
I've got an Australian friend.

35:01.920 --> 35:02.720
I can say whatever.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.280
Sorry, Travis thinks you sound like Orson Welles.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.080
Yeah, and fat Orson Welles too.

35:08.960 --> 35:09.600
You're welcome.

35:11.680 --> 35:14.960
This is the fucking house of leaves of my brother.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.080
My brother me questions.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.840
I still don't understand the scenario.

35:17.840 --> 35:22.240
Can I just suggest an answer that we have gotten more,

35:24.160 --> 35:28.240
leaned on more frequently, I think, in our twilight years.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.840
Just tell them.

35:30.400 --> 35:34.400
Just tell them and sit and use your word and just tell them.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.520
Can I role play this though?

35:35.520 --> 35:39.680
I'll be, you be the person telling and I will be the parties that are moving away for a while.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.080
Crikey, Jim.

35:42.080 --> 35:42.960
Okay, start over.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.160
I'm sorry to have-

35:44.160 --> 35:45.520
Do try again.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.040
Okay, start over.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.640
Garblimey, Governor.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.360
Nailed it.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.160
I have some bad news for you.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.520
Okay, I'm listening.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.120
When you're moving out, it's gonna be really hard for us to sustain rent.

35:59.120 --> 35:59.920
Oh, we're not moving out.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.760
We're just hopping out to Australia.

36:01.760 --> 36:06.160
We're gonna put, you know, feel free to sublet them, but then we're gonna get back

36:06.160 --> 36:08.640
because we're a majority share of the people living in the house.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.000
We're just gonna hop back right in there.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.600
You bring up an excellent point, Griffin.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.200
Are they planning on paying rent for the five months they're gone?

36:15.200 --> 36:21.920
See, I would like to suggest, I would like to make a motion to table, reason being that

36:21.920 --> 36:29.200
we do not have enough information to accurately and professionally solve this problem.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.160
Seconded.

36:30.160 --> 36:30.480
Sorry.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.120
Seconded.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.400
All those in favor, say aye.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.360
Aye.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.320
Aye.

36:35.040 --> 36:35.760
All those opposed?

36:35.760 --> 36:36.320
I abstain.

36:36.880 --> 36:37.600
Motion passes.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.240
I abstain until marriage.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.360
Until marriage.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.160
Let's get paid.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.240
March is National Start Your Business Month.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.800
which is a new concept in eyewear.

38:55.920 --> 38:59.760
Glasses are expensive in most cases.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.560
I just actually, I bought some glasses like a dumb-o

39:03.600 --> 39:12.480
and it cost me $600 million, like after evil.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.040
Borat.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.640
Are you telling me you got rid of the Randy Jackson shades?

39:16.640 --> 39:19.360
The Randy Jackson shades were apparently my prescription

39:19.360 --> 39:22.720
and those particular frame-os were like ancient

39:22.720 --> 39:24.240
because I went to a doctor and he's like,

39:24.240 --> 39:24.880
let me try this.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.680
And I was like, oh, shades.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.520
You could suddenly see through the wall.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.200
I remember shapes, sure.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.080
So yeah, I got rid of those.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.280
I got rid of those Randy Jacksons.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.240
I got Lucky Brand, like the jeans, and they're cool.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.840
I think they look all right, but on the inside,

39:39.840 --> 39:42.640
it says Lucky You, which I also have a pair of jeans

39:42.640 --> 39:45.440
that say that on the zipper when you unzip them.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.640
So like, if you're getting into the act of intimacy

39:49.280 --> 39:51.440
and then it's like a little banner that's like,

39:51.440 --> 39:53.600
hey, I'm a douche nozzle.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.640
Anyway, that was a very long-

39:56.640 --> 39:57.600
Don't be a fuck-up like Griffin.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.320
Don't be a fuck-up.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.920
I fuck up so hard.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.680
Go to Warby Parker and you can get

40:02.400 --> 40:05.200
Fashion Forward Prescriptione glasses

40:05.760 --> 40:06.800
that start at $95.

40:08.240 --> 40:08.640
What?

40:08.640 --> 40:11.600
Yeah, and they include anti-reflective, anti-glare coating.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.520
I did pay extra for those on my stupid ass douche glasses.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.080
And that $95 includes the prescription.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.240
Includes the prescription, includes the frames,

40:20.240 --> 40:23.280
includes the anti-reflective and anti-glare coating,

40:23.280 --> 40:25.520
which you should use if you use a computer a lot.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.000
But now here's the, like, let me give you the,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.520
let me give you the big best thing about Warby Parker,

40:31.520 --> 40:33.440
the thing that Griffin really fucked up.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.120
They have a home try-on program.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.440
They'll go to send you five pairs of glasses

40:37.440 --> 40:39.280
to right to your house.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.120
You try them on, you pick the ones you want,

40:41.120 --> 40:44.560
preferably the ones that don't say Lucky You on the inside.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.120
And then you send them back, the ones you don't want back.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.280
You don't, are not obligated to buy anything.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.880
It's like a gift for you.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.080
They also have prescription polarized sunglasses for $150.

40:54.080 --> 40:54.560
No big deal.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.480
Just finally protect your eyes.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.320
That's a great deal because what I had to do

40:58.320 --> 41:00.480
was go to the glasses store, buy myself,

41:01.040 --> 41:04.480
put on glasses and take pictures of myself discreetly

41:04.480 --> 41:06.640
using my phone and then send them to my wife saying,

41:06.640 --> 41:08.240
do these make me look like an asshole?

41:09.040 --> 41:10.080
We've all been there.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.480
I did the same thing the last time I tried on stupid glasses.

41:12.480 --> 41:15.040
Boy, do I love taking pictures of myself in public.

41:16.080 --> 41:16.640
Don't do that.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.680
Go to Warby Parker.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.640
If you go to warbyparker.com slash my brother,

41:20.640 --> 41:22.560
you can get free three-day shipping

41:22.560 --> 41:27.120
on your five home try-on frames, which is crazy.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.440
So go to that warbyparker.com slash my brother,

41:29.440 --> 41:32.720
all one word, and don't embarrass yourself in public.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.520
Got a message for Alita from Will.

41:36.480 --> 41:40.000
Alita says, you filled, oh, this seems like a song,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.200
but I'm gonna try my best.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.000
There's definitely-

41:42.000 --> 41:43.600
No, do it like a beat poet.

41:43.600 --> 41:43.920
Okay.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.640
Can you guys give me some beats?

41:46.640 --> 41:47.760
You know that that's not what beat poets do.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.720
Yeah, it comes in between.

41:48.720 --> 41:52.640
You filled me with such love and joy

41:54.240 --> 41:55.520
since before I got a one knee.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.560
Marriage to you is greater still.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.520
How we were meant to be.

42:02.960 --> 42:08.560
This year, we made discoveries like UU and D&D.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.480
Commitments that strengthened ours

42:12.480 --> 42:14.320
and brought you closer to me.

42:14.320 --> 42:19.040
I know not what next year will bring.

42:19.040 --> 42:24.400
Sights that we will see, but I don't care.

42:24.400 --> 42:32.560
Everywhere you look, everywhere there's a heart.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.480
So that's the end of it.

42:34.480 --> 42:37.840
I assume she didn't have enough room to make up the last rhyme.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.440
So, but I don't care.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.480
You're my snuggle bear.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.880
I'll just write that for Alita.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.360
So I'm glad you guys are in love.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.320
That makes me very happy.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.240
Alita and Will, and I hope you have many more to come.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.880
Travis, do we have any other messages?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.160
We do for Tommy S.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.800
It's from Claire S.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.440
It's a special birthday wish.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.920
I'm hoping the McElroy brothers will gift to you

42:59.920 --> 43:01.680
a new term of endearment.

43:01.680 --> 43:04.000
You've had the same one since 2002

43:04.000 --> 43:08.480
and only their collective genii can replace it with something better.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.640
Genii, it's the plural of genitalia.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.240
Yeah, I see.

43:12.240 --> 43:16.000
I love you so much and look forward to the next 150 birthdays together.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.920
P.S. Let's make a baby.

43:17.920 --> 43:18.420
Boom.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.400
What is-

43:20.400 --> 43:20.900
Whoa.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.200
Why are we booming?

43:23.200 --> 43:26.240
And then it says, Dear McElroy brothers, please help with a new-

43:26.240 --> 43:28.160
And then it's cut off, so I don't know.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.920
I'm assuming it's new baby.

43:29.920 --> 43:30.720
A new baby.

43:30.720 --> 43:30.960
All right.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.600
I can give you some-

43:32.720 --> 43:34.560
Okay, so here's what you're gonna need to do.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.720
Here's how that all works.

43:37.520 --> 43:38.640
New term of endearment.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.000
New term of endearment.

43:40.000 --> 43:40.500
What's-

43:40.500 --> 43:40.800
Baby maker.

43:40.800 --> 43:41.300
What's the name?

43:42.160 --> 43:42.960
Claire S.

43:42.960 --> 43:43.840
How about this?

43:43.840 --> 43:44.400
Claire's.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.560
No, it's for Tommy.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.280
No, we're looking for Tommy though.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.080
Oh, it's for Tommy.

43:48.080 --> 43:48.580
Shit.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.160
No, but call him Claire.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.120
How about that?

43:51.120 --> 43:51.600
What about-

43:51.600 --> 43:52.100
Tommy's.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.240
King baby maker.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.380
Uh-huh.

43:56.000 --> 43:56.880
What about prince?

43:57.680 --> 43:58.560
Prince is too much.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.600
Baby hose.

43:59.600 --> 44:00.400
Squidgy face.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.720
Rummy tummy tom tom.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.040
No.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.960
Rummy tummy tom tom is very good.

44:04.960 --> 44:05.520
Tommy gun.

44:06.080 --> 44:06.580
Tommy gun.

44:06.580 --> 44:07.280
That's what everyone knows.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.880
Like the porn star?

44:08.880 --> 44:09.380
Yeah.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.200
I think Tommy gun's a box-

44:11.200 --> 44:12.160
Tommy touch a lot.

44:13.040 --> 44:13.920
Tommy toucher.

44:14.960 --> 44:16.000
Tommy toucher.

44:16.000 --> 44:16.800
Touchable Tom.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.040
Ricky ticky Tommy.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.440
Earl Ray Tomblin.

44:23.760 --> 44:24.560
The Tommiest.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.680
The Who's Tommy.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.720
Yes, the Who's Tommy.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.680
That will be fine.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.280
This wasn't an expensive message.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.560
The Who's Tommy is good enough for this, I think.

44:34.560 --> 44:34.960
Wonderful.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.960
I still think Rummy tummy tom Thomas.

44:36.960 --> 44:40.880
Well, you have many options that you can choose from at your discretion.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.120
So please enjoy them.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.040
Hello, I'm Judge John Hodgman.

44:47.040 --> 44:48.880
And I'm bailiff Jesse Thorn.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.520
Can you force your girlfriend to listen to heavy metal music?

44:52.240 --> 44:54.080
Is a machine gun a robot?

44:54.080 --> 44:57.280
Is it okay to take coupons out of the garbage if you're Canadian?

44:57.840 --> 45:01.360
What should you do if your parrot attacks your husband?

45:01.360 --> 45:04.560
Can you prove that Crank 2 is a good movie?

45:04.560 --> 45:06.160
Only one man can decide.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.160
Judge John Hodgman.

45:08.160 --> 45:12.080
If you have a case for the judge's court, visit Maximumfun.org

45:12.080 --> 45:14.080
slash JJ Ho.

45:14.080 --> 45:18.720
If you just want to listen in, find us on the web or free in iTunes.

45:20.720 --> 45:26.640
My boyfriend and I look extremely alike with pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.840
Everyone knew we automatically assumes we're brother and sister.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.680
We've been dating for almost two years.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.920
However, this problem still hasn't gone away.

45:33.920 --> 45:38.640
How do we crush the assumption that we're siblings without having to explain to everyone

45:38.640 --> 45:41.600
beforehand that we're in a relationship?

45:41.600 --> 45:43.760
That's a good one.

45:46.880 --> 45:52.080
When I was in college once, I went to 7-Eleven with a girlfriend at the time.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.880
And we were getting some Slurpees.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.840
And we got the Slurpees, we took them up to the register.

45:57.840 --> 46:01.600
And the guy inexplicably went, are y'all brother and sister?

46:01.600 --> 46:04.400
And we're like, no, we're not.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.520
We're boyfriend and girlfriend.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.080
We're dating.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.880
And he felt so bad that he gave us our Slurpees for free.

46:09.520 --> 46:10.560
So I guess this story-

46:10.560 --> 46:13.040
Why would he just volunteer that judgment?

46:13.040 --> 46:13.540
Right.

46:14.320 --> 46:18.080
I guess this whole story is to say you shouldn't.

46:18.080 --> 46:20.400
You can maybe turn this into free Slurpees.

46:21.280 --> 46:22.480
This could be worse.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.120
You could actually be brother and sister.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.880
Or they could think you're like mom and son.

46:26.880 --> 46:32.400
I have never-

46:33.440 --> 46:36.320
And I don't think there's any exception to this.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.320
I have never gone to a restaurant with my wife.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.440
Because she's a much more attractive human than I am.

46:45.440 --> 46:46.720
I've never gone to a restaurant with my wife.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.600
Categorically and objectively.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.080
Yes.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.360
In every respect.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.160
I have never-

46:52.160 --> 46:52.960
Intellectually.

46:53.920 --> 46:54.560
I've never-

46:54.560 --> 46:55.440
Financially.

46:55.440 --> 46:58.640
Not been asked, are you two together?

46:59.920 --> 47:01.360
Are these separate checks?

47:01.360 --> 47:02.960
Never not been asked.

47:02.960 --> 47:04.320
Is that true?

47:04.320 --> 47:08.160
I have to imagine the assumption that she is in some way my caregiver.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.200
That that is the relationship that we share.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.280
That it could not be a romantic one.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.480
Somewhere the waiters are going,

47:14.480 --> 47:17.120
how long does big brothers, big sisters last?

47:17.120 --> 47:17.440
Yeah.

47:17.440 --> 47:20.000
Because at some point they grow up and you stop hanging out with them, right?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.400
This is a wicked big brother at this point.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.440
Wait, this brother is aged.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.240
Biggest brothers, biggest sisters.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.040
So it could be worse.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.760
I mean, the obvious answer is you just dye your hair, right?

47:34.400 --> 47:35.120
Something fun.

47:35.120 --> 47:35.680
Who does it though?

47:35.680 --> 47:36.720
Get a full face touch.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.240
How do you decide who does it?

47:38.240 --> 47:39.680
You both have to do it.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.000
That's the deal with the devil you're gonna make.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.960
But like dye their hair the same color?

47:44.960 --> 47:46.960
No, one of you go red, one of you go blue.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.480
Someone's getting the short end of that stick.

47:50.480 --> 47:51.280
Yeah.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.240
Well, maybe that would go great with one of their looks.

47:54.240 --> 47:54.960
I don't know.

47:54.960 --> 47:56.720
How about like homemade t-shirts?

47:58.400 --> 47:59.520
Not his brother?

47:59.520 --> 47:59.760
Yeah.

47:59.760 --> 48:00.640
You say that?

48:00.640 --> 48:00.880
Yeah.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.680
Yeah, but then you gotta wear the same shirt every day.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.440
Who is asking you about this?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I can see like if you meet new people,

48:11.360 --> 48:12.480
some of them being like,

48:12.480 --> 48:13.920
so are you two brothers?

48:13.920 --> 48:15.200
You know, like, I don't know.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.400
No, see, like I told that delightful Slurpee anecdote,

48:18.400 --> 48:21.600
but like outside of that, this has literally never happened

48:21.600 --> 48:22.560
to me before.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.880
Nobody ever, because everybody's fucking bad at this.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.840
Everybody knows how bad they are at this.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.160
Nobody would say that.

48:30.160 --> 48:30.880
Nobody would guess.

48:30.880 --> 48:33.120
It's like a faux pas on the level of like,

48:33.120 --> 48:34.320
hey, when's the baby due?

48:34.320 --> 48:35.680
Like you don't fucking say it.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.720
You don't say that shit.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.480
Here's an idea.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.440
When you meet new people,

48:39.440 --> 48:41.200
when you're being introduced to them,

48:41.200 --> 48:42.320
and someone says like,

48:42.320 --> 48:44.960
hey, Steve, come over here and meet my two friends,

48:44.960 --> 48:46.480
immediately start making out.

48:46.480 --> 48:48.960
Just like hardcore.

48:48.960 --> 48:52.400
So that way, either Steve is going to safely assume

48:52.400 --> 48:53.760
that you are not brother and sister,

48:54.560 --> 48:57.680
or Steve is still going to assume that you're brother

48:57.680 --> 49:00.240
and sister and be real freaked out.

49:00.240 --> 49:00.740
Maybe.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.360
Or maybe Steve's down.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.920
Listen, I don't want to judge Steve at this point.

49:05.920 --> 49:07.440
I don't know what Steve's into.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.800
Hey, I don't want to label it.

49:08.800 --> 49:10.000
You know, that's Steve's life.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.320
I haven't lived his life.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.120
I haven't been there.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.040
I don't know what he's seen or done.

49:15.040 --> 49:18.400
I just can't believe in 2014 that this is an issue.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.440
The people are still this presumptuous.

49:19.440 --> 49:19.840
I know.

49:19.840 --> 49:20.960
That's crazy to me.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.200
Yeah, it seems a little nutty to me too.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.840
I mean, I guess you could just introduce her,

49:27.840 --> 49:31.280
or him or her as your partner in smooching.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.240
Do you guys want Yahoo?

49:32.240 --> 49:32.740
I guess.

49:34.320 --> 49:34.820
Okay.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.520
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.320
Are you Ira Ray?

49:40.320 --> 49:41.360
Who wants to know?

49:43.520 --> 49:44.240
Thank you, Ira Ray.

49:44.240 --> 49:45.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.000
Oh, didgeridooed, who asks.

49:48.880 --> 49:49.680
Pretty good.

49:49.680 --> 49:50.000
Nice.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.920
Why won't they let me play the didgeridoo

49:51.920 --> 49:54.880
as part of the band for our church choir on Sundays?

49:55.760 --> 49:56.640
Wait, hold on.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.200
Is this a dude who identifies himself

49:59.200 --> 50:01.760
purely based on his didgeridoo skills?

50:01.760 --> 50:04.480
Or it is a sentient didgeridoo.

50:06.080 --> 50:07.600
Why won't they let me play myself?

50:07.600 --> 50:11.120
Pastor says, can't play with myself no more.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.800
This is an important question.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.000
I'm sorry, Griffin, one more time.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.240
Why won't they let me play the didgeridoo

50:20.240 --> 50:22.160
as part of the band for our church on Sundays,

50:22.160 --> 50:23.360
our church choir on Sundays?

50:24.240 --> 50:25.760
It would be super dope.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.280
Period.

50:27.280 --> 50:27.760
That's it.

50:27.760 --> 50:28.240
Yeah.

50:28.240 --> 50:28.800
That would be-

50:28.800 --> 50:32.160
To hear like Amazing Grace and every so often just like-

50:32.160 --> 50:35.120
Our God is an awesome God.

50:35.120 --> 50:38.000
Our God is an awesome God.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.520
He reigns from-

50:42.880 --> 50:45.280
It just sounds like the beginning of Survivor every time.

50:45.280 --> 50:45.840
That'd be so dope.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.760
Listen, churches are trying to get like fucking hip

50:47.760 --> 50:49.600
with the kids, especially with their music.

50:49.600 --> 50:50.960
Cause it's like easy to just like,

50:50.960 --> 50:52.000
hey, we have an electric guitar.

50:52.000 --> 50:52.960
We're basically Switchfoot.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.640
I think there's a lot of alternative percussion

50:56.640 --> 50:57.280
going on there.

50:58.400 --> 50:59.120
A lot of gym-

50:59.120 --> 51:01.440
Every church now has a didgeridoo, a rain stick.

51:01.440 --> 51:06.160
A didge, a jimp, a jimb, a jim-bay, a rain stick,

51:06.160 --> 51:09.600
a glockenspiel, and hand bells.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.280
And that's it.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.000
And that's it.

51:12.000 --> 51:12.720
And they make beautiful-

51:12.720 --> 51:13.760
It's a ragtag group.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.080
You would think no way that good music comes out of that.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.640
But then they win the church band competition

51:20.080 --> 51:21.360
and they save the rec center.

51:22.400 --> 51:22.880
Justin, are you-

51:22.880 --> 51:23.280
I'm missing-

51:23.280 --> 51:24.320
I'm mixing a lot of genres.

51:24.320 --> 51:25.040
You're being very quiet.

51:25.600 --> 51:27.040
Are you Googling didgeridoo or-

51:27.920 --> 51:29.280
No, I know what a didgeridoo is.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.680
It's only in front.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.840
I just guess I don't understand the question really.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.920
Is there something inherently sinful about the didgeridoo,

51:37.920 --> 51:39.520
I guess is the question.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.320
It's phallic.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.040
It is extremely phallic and you do put your mouth on it.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.680
And I do not think that that is something that they would

51:45.680 --> 51:47.360
appreciate at the front of the congregation.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.320
But they let Ms. Margaret play her oboe in the church band.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.400
That's the most phallic instrument there is.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.360
It's got foreskin.

51:54.080 --> 51:57.600
I have seen people play didgeridoo in public before.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.280
And every time-

51:59.280 --> 52:00.160
They should be ashamed.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.960
Every time I see it, I have exactly one question.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.080
It's always the same question.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.640
What are you trying to prove?

52:08.320 --> 52:09.840
That they can play didgeridoo well?

52:09.840 --> 52:10.880
Check this out.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.160
You said I can't play didgeridoo,

52:12.160 --> 52:13.440
but I can prove you wrong right now.

52:13.440 --> 52:14.000
Categorically.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.760
We all do very good dig impressions, I think.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.240
If I'm not mistaken, I think that you play a didgeridoo

52:24.240 --> 52:25.280
by putting your mouth on it

52:25.280 --> 52:28.000
and making didgeridoo sounds through it.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.440
Just put your mouth on it and go-

52:29.440 --> 52:33.600
It's just a tube that you make didgeridoo noises into.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.320
I play didgeridoo with this cardboard tube.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.800
Do you remember that book we used to have as kids?

52:39.520 --> 52:41.040
A hundred household items that you could-

52:41.040 --> 52:43.120
Hey kids, turn these household items into digs.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.280
Got that from the library.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.720
It was a fun rainy day activity.

52:48.560 --> 52:51.520
Toilet paper rolls.

52:52.320 --> 52:53.040
Your hands.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.360
Paper towel rolls.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.640
Wrapping paper rolls.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.120
Saran wrap rolls.

53:01.120 --> 53:03.840
Biscuit tins when you take the biscuits out.

53:04.480 --> 53:05.280
Very carefully.

53:05.280 --> 53:07.360
Don't unwrap that because then you can't get a good sound.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.200
You can't dig an unwrapped biscuit roll.

53:10.240 --> 53:10.800
Stupid fucking-

53:10.800 --> 53:12.400
That was the sequel book, dummy.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.280
How to dig an unwrapped biscuit roll.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.480
A hundred cent process.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.000
Croissants.

53:19.040 --> 53:19.540
Croissants.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.440
Can you dig a croissant?

53:21.440 --> 53:24.560
You can- Oh baby, you ain't lived until you digged a croissant.

53:27.680 --> 53:28.960
Gotta be a big and thick one though.

53:28.960 --> 53:30.560
Gotta be a Grant's croissant.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.880
And then you burrow a little hole in there like you're making pigs in a blanket,

53:32.880 --> 53:33.280
but you're not.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.640
You're making a dig in a blanket.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.440
I once lived in a pig in a blanket.

53:38.160 --> 53:38.660
No!

53:39.600 --> 53:42.160
Me and my pig friend Porky.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.600
We live inside a tuck.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.200
Me and my dumb Amelie.

53:45.200 --> 53:49.120
Your Amelie sounds a lot like your Snowden but without a lisp.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.720
Have you noticed that?

53:51.840 --> 53:52.240
He's my brother!

53:52.240 --> 53:53.680
Do people ever think they're brother and sister?

53:53.680 --> 53:55.360
Okay, fantastic.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.600
We are brother and sister, it is true.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.040
He hides inside my heart.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.440
I once used the Amelie DVD as a dig.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.840
Not a deep- not a lot of reverb on that particular dig, but-

54:07.840 --> 54:09.360
Thank you for digging my movie!

54:10.000 --> 54:10.560
You're welcome.

54:10.560 --> 54:12.160
I didn't watch it, I just digged it.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.680
That's actually what digital distribution means.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.240
Did you know that?

54:16.240 --> 54:16.640
Yeah.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.040
Yep.

54:17.040 --> 54:21.600
It means sending a movie through a didgeridoo.

54:21.600 --> 54:24.400
It's a man who describes hit films

54:24.400 --> 54:26.880
while talking to you through a didgeridoo.

54:26.880 --> 54:30.320
And the dream is actually within the dream

54:30.320 --> 54:33.840
and then he wakes up in its fucking section.

54:35.120 --> 54:39.280
It's totally depressing, he's a slave for 12 years.

54:39.280 --> 54:46.320
He can say he's a free man in a door or a door or a thot.

54:46.320 --> 54:51.600
So, for the second time, they have to pretend this dead guy is alive.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.440
It's weak into Bernie's too.

54:55.360 --> 54:57.840
It's important that they ditch the name of the show.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.440
Uh, didgeridoos.

55:01.440 --> 55:02.400
We're done.

55:02.400 --> 55:02.880
We did it.

55:02.880 --> 55:03.760
We got to the end.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.400
And you made it the whole way,

55:06.400 --> 55:08.800
so you have to take some ownership of that.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.360
You listen to the whole thing and that's on you.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.960
It's my brother, my brother, and me,

55:12.960 --> 55:14.880
and we're so happy to be able to do it for you.

55:14.880 --> 55:16.000
Uh, every week.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.520
Next week is huge.

55:18.240 --> 55:25.120
It is, uh, our first of two, uh, Max Fund Drive specials.

55:25.760 --> 55:29.280
We are, uh, ramping up the Max Fund Drive.

55:29.280 --> 55:33.440
There's going to be lots of, uh, uh, awards and presents

55:33.440 --> 55:34.720
that you can get for supporting the network,

55:34.720 --> 55:38.080
plus an opportunity to help make the best podcast network

55:38.080 --> 55:39.040
in the world even better.

55:39.760 --> 55:42.000
And you're going to be able to be there for that.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.280
It's going to be a great show.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.040
We hope you will join us.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.360
We do some extra long eps.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.680
We got that bonus app for anybody who donates.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.880
We also have that catalog of, of bonus episodes.

55:52.880 --> 55:55.360
So if you haven't donated before and you give this year,

55:56.160 --> 55:58.160
and you start your contributions and you'll get all of that,

55:58.160 --> 56:01.280
you'll also get bonus episodes from every other show

56:01.280 --> 56:01.920
on the network.

56:01.920 --> 56:03.920
It's a pretty crazy amount of content.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.800
I think you'll get, I think there are like five,

56:06.800 --> 56:08.880
my brother, my brother, me, two.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.640
I think it's like, I think either three or four.

56:10.640 --> 56:13.200
No, because we had the Max Fund Day episodes.

56:13.200 --> 56:13.920
Oh shit.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.320
So there's five, my brother, my brother, me's.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.600
There's two with our dad.

56:20.320 --> 56:24.720
There's two riff videos that we made,

56:24.720 --> 56:30.160
like goofing on an old, like instructional,

56:30.160 --> 56:31.520
educational video.

56:31.520 --> 56:35.440
And there's actually 15 minutes of our Austin live show.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.080
Oh, that's right.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.000
And I mean, that's just us.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.520
Like every show on the network is going to have stuff

56:41.520 --> 56:42.480
like that too.

56:42.480 --> 56:44.640
Like you should also be listening to those other shows.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.920
If you're not, like Bullseye and Throwing Shade

56:47.920 --> 56:52.640
and Stop Podcasting Yourself and The Goose Down and Saw Bones,

56:53.680 --> 56:55.440
and you'll get bonus shit for all that stuff too.

56:55.440 --> 56:59.280
So just think about if you have listened for a while

56:59.280 --> 57:01.920
and you've never really thought about it,

57:01.920 --> 57:04.560
just give it a ponder, ponder if you can help support us.

57:04.560 --> 57:08.400
Because that is like, we get some scratch from the,

57:08.400 --> 57:10.960
you know, Jumbotrons and the advertisements and stuff,

57:10.960 --> 57:13.600
but like a bulk of the support that we get

57:13.600 --> 57:15.440
is through the Max Fund Drive, which is incredible.
