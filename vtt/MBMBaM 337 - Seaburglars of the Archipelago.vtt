00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:50.000
Hello everybody, and welcome back to the jungle of 2017. My brother and me is the podcast,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.200
and I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. And I am the brother that is in the middle,

00:55.200 --> 00:58.160
Travis Patrick McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother,

00:58.160 --> 01:04.800
30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. Gonna try to get that in every episode,

01:04.800 --> 01:07.360
just get it in real fast. Work on your brand.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.520
Practice saying it real fast so it's not a big distraction, 30 under 30 media luminary.

01:12.400 --> 01:18.800
So, it's 20 Serpentine, y'all. We're zagging left and right.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.680
Well, no, but- We are zag nuts over here.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.720
I mean, you can't zag left and right. We are zagging either left or right,

01:26.720 --> 01:29.520
and then the other direction that would technically be a zig.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.840
Incorrect. Incorrect.

01:31.840 --> 01:37.280
Okay. Okay, I see what you're saying. And like, you're getting to the root of it, I think.

01:37.280 --> 01:37.680
Yeah.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.680
We're close there. There's something to what you're saying, because one would be a zig.

01:41.680 --> 01:45.360
But like, I wasn't thinking in sequence, but I guess once you started in a line,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.680
all lefts are zigs, all rights are zags.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.840
But you can't zag every time, because then you're not zagging. You know what I mean?

01:51.840 --> 01:56.800
If you zag, zag, zag, zag, zag, that's nothing. You got to zag, zag, zag, zig. What?

01:56.800 --> 01:57.040
What? What?

01:57.040 --> 01:58.000
Where'd that zig come from?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.280
Oh my god, Travis, are you suggesting that this week, we zig on them?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.720
Maybe we zig, Griffin.

02:02.720 --> 02:09.680
All right. I do want to say that at this point, I have mostly purged my Facebook friends and

02:09.680 --> 02:17.040
Twitter followers and LinkedIn connections and friendster friendos of all non-30 under 30 media

02:17.040 --> 02:23.680
luminaries. But you two have made the cut. You're some of the, we call you standards,

02:24.560 --> 02:30.400
or we call you non-30s. You two are some of the only non-30s that I have on my list.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.400
And following you two on social, it's not as enlightening as the other stuff is,

02:36.400 --> 02:41.840
but I noticed that you've been doing some mad zagging just in this one week where you've been

02:41.840 --> 02:43.120
trying this bold new experiment.

02:43.120 --> 02:50.880
Well, we do have to congratulate, I think, the zag of the week, I think, has to go to Forbes,

02:51.600 --> 02:59.680
honestly. Like, you don't zag much harder than naming Griffin one of the 30 people under 30

02:59.680 --> 03:04.560
in media on a list. I was like, is it like best or most? Is it most?

03:04.560 --> 03:17.760
Most would make sense. Best, I vore Nintendo toys professionally, so I'm not sure how I can go

03:18.640 --> 03:23.440
up against a Jesse Eisenberg, who would also be considered for media, I think,

03:23.440 --> 03:26.640
or a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has his own media company.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.200
He's not, wait, he's not 30?

03:29.200 --> 03:31.920
No, definitely not. That dude's like 22 years old.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.400
Damn.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.760
Thank you, Forbes, for the honor. You zagged all of us pretty hard.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.400
Joseph Gordon-Levitt's 35 years old. Thank God.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.520
Don't do this. Oh, thank God.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.480
Shit, we don't Facebook. Keep it.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.440
Thank Jesus.

03:43.440 --> 03:48.160
Travis, your zag, you have, so what I like about you, Travis, is you're working on a zag now,

03:48.160 --> 03:53.040
and you've also got a prospective zag in the future that you want to chase down.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.800
I have four zags.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.680
Oh my God.

03:55.680 --> 04:01.200
I have major zags and minor zags that I have charted throughout the year,

04:01.200 --> 04:04.560
and then I'll probably just surprise myself, zag on myself,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.240
and do stuff that's not in there.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.680
Right now, working on electric guitar.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.200
Yeah, so you started, you've never played an acoustic, right?

04:13.200 --> 04:13.200
Correct.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.960
That's where most folks get their, okay.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.600
Because, because, because.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.880
You want to shred.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.680
I want to shred.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.880
Every time I've ever picked up an instrument ever, if I was not immediately magically good at it,

04:24.880 --> 04:27.840
I then set it down, and it has been dead to me.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.160
Okay.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.320
And, and I sat down with my new electric guitar for an hour the other day, like yesterday,

04:34.320 --> 04:38.240
just practicing moving my fingers up and down the frets.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.840
Like, that was it, for an hour.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.080
I'm committed to becoming good at this long term,

04:44.080 --> 04:47.920
and not just like, I'm going to learn to play three chords and call it a day.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.520
Like, I'm going to fucking shred.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.000
Okay.

04:52.000 --> 04:52.880
This year.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.800
I'm going to learn three chords and call it a day has been working for me on guitar for 15 years.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.440
Well, don't knock it till you tried it, buddy.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.480
Also, I do very much enjoy the rationale of the electric guitar, which is to say,

05:06.480 --> 05:09.600
I don't know how to play this, but I do wish it was louder.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.080
Yeah.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.760
I do wish I could hear better what I was doing so poorly.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.560
And my neighbor, I would love my neighbors to know I'm, I'm just starting out something over here.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.680
This isn't anything.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.680
Everyone's got to check this out.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.200
My baby's going to love this.

05:23.200 --> 05:23.840
Oh, yeah.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.000
What did you tell me?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.520
Run down those other zags though, Trav.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.320
Oh, I don't know how much I want to give away.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.840
I'll do some minor zags.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.800
I've decided to get really into dips.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.280
I'm going to make, I'm going to master guacamole salsa.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.800
Okay, well, that's not, that's not.

05:39.360 --> 05:39.840
Okay.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.080
I'm also going to get a sleeve tattoo.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.440
Yeah, that'll zag me pretty good.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.080
Yes.

05:44.080 --> 05:44.320
Yeah.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.400
Because I was looking, Travis, I was looking over here.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.920
There you are over here, over here on the other side.

05:47.920 --> 05:48.800
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.240
You're thinking, oh, guacamole.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.360
Yeah, guacamole.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.080
Tattoos.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.440
Can you get tattoos of just a big glistening bowl of guaco?

05:58.000 --> 05:58.480
Perhaps.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.080
I mean, I can.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.320
I don't know if I will.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.360
I'm done with your zags.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.360
Justin, your zag surprised me very much, but I'm very excited by it.

06:08.160 --> 06:08.560
Can you tell-

06:08.560 --> 06:12.880
Yeah, I took a taekwondo class on Wednesday.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.240
Got some gi and everything.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.000
Two classes, one gi, $30.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.680
Walk me through.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.280
Is this going to be a continuing thing or did you just do one and done it?

06:21.280 --> 06:28.800
Oh, no, I'm headed for mastery is where I asked them to put me on the mastery track.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.040
Yeah.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.520
It's the one thing that they said that was attainable.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.960
Two important questions.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.000
One, tell me everything that happened in the class.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.240
Okay.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.440
And number two, because maybe you want to start with number two is why did you choose

06:43.440 --> 06:49.840
this particular discipline of all of the martial arts sort of specializations?

06:49.840 --> 06:52.320
Well, I researched them all very much.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.600
And the one that was five minutes from my house was taekwondo.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.960
That's how Bruce Lee did his thing.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.120
Yeah, that's how Bruce Lee got started.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.480
When I arrived, I said, this is fun.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.760
They told me I should show up and observe a class.

07:08.400 --> 07:13.280
And when I showed up, I said, you know, I was interested in maybe taking a class.

07:13.280 --> 07:17.040
And the lady like disappeared behind the counter and came back with a gi.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.200
And I was like, oh, apparently I'm just taking a taekwondo class today.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.440
This is not what I had anticipated.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.520
And I had just written a strenuous 20 minutes on the stationary bike.

07:27.520 --> 07:33.760
But right before I was not in any sort of headspace to start learning taekwondo.

07:33.760 --> 07:40.400
The other thing that surprised me about the taekwondo class.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.000
Probably the biggest surprise.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.960
Is this how early I started punching?

07:44.960 --> 07:52.080
Like when I was instructed to punch, I kind of looked around like, I don't know how to punch.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.120
I certainly didn't.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.600
You don't think they're going to let you punch day one, right?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.480
No, they didn't say that.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.840
Yeah, you don't show up to med school day one and they're like, all right, cut this dude.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.320
What?

08:02.320 --> 08:03.760
Cut this dude right now.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.280
Wait, so what do they dangle in front of you if they let you punch day one?

08:07.280 --> 08:07.840
You know what I mean?

08:07.840 --> 08:12.000
What's the cliffhanger that brings you back for day two?

08:12.000 --> 08:16.560
I guess punching in a way that would have any sort of effect on anything on earth would be good.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.920
I see, punching with purpose.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.080
So important taekwondo question.

08:20.640 --> 08:20.880
Yeah.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.080
Keep in mind, I've had one class go on.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.760
Has it got belts?

08:26.800 --> 08:27.840
Yeah, it's got belts.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.600
I'm headed.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.400
I feel like, okay, so here's, this is my actual like thing.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.560
I know that a black belt would take a very long time, right?

08:39.120 --> 08:41.280
So I've sort of ruled that out.

08:41.280 --> 08:47.840
That's probably not in my future, but I feel like if I get any color belt, most people don't know

08:48.640 --> 08:51.600
the order in which the belts come, right?

08:51.600 --> 08:57.680
So if I attain a yellow belt and I can tell people like, oh yeah, I'm a yellow belt in taekwondo.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.800
They're not going to know if that's impressive or not.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.920
That's number two.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.680
That's like the second one.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.440
Well, you know that and I know that now after my one taekwondo class.

09:05.440 --> 09:10.640
But yeah, it was, it was, it was actually, you know, here's the surprising thing.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.600
It was very hard.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.680
What would the physicality of punching and kicking for an hour?

09:15.680 --> 09:16.800
That was not great.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.640
That part was a little hard for me.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.040
I've been, I've been trying to think of my own Zag I can do.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.240
Cause you guys are setting a pretty like bonkers precedent over there.

09:25.520 --> 09:30.640
And just by saying this, I'm ruining my, this Zag and I definitely won't be able to do it after

09:30.640 --> 09:35.200
I say it, but how great would it be if my Zag was like, okay, I'm going to do this.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.960
My Zag was that I also took taekwondo classes without telling you guys.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.320
And then at our next live show, Justin and I had to fight each other.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.600
While I, while I accompanied you on electric guitar.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.160
Oh man.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.720
That's a good, that's a good look in that shit.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.000
Damn it.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.520
Maybe I'll edit this out of the podcast.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.080
Justin and I will just like, well, I don't edit the podcast.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.200
Well, no, it's too late.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.480
Everybody knows now that Justin and I are martial arts enemies.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.520
Well, we're, we're the masters of rival dojos.

10:01.520 --> 10:01.920
Damn it.

10:01.920 --> 10:07.360
The, the idea that I would actually come in contact with another person with punches and

10:07.360 --> 10:13.760
kicking while doing taekwondo, while doing my taekwondo art, uh, occurred to me about

10:13.760 --> 10:20.960
15 seconds ago when you said that I had not even prepared myself for the eventuality that

10:20.960 --> 10:26.640
I would someday meet another person who I had to be good, better at punching and kicking than.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.080
Or else you will be punished with, with, with physical harm.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.000
Or they steal my belt, don't they?

10:32.000 --> 10:32.640
Yeah, that's it.

10:33.360 --> 10:33.760
That's it.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.400
Steal my belt.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.440
There's only like five black belts around, going around and they sort of cycle, you know?

10:39.440 --> 10:40.400
They sort of cycle in and out.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.520
You gotta beat, you gotta beat a black belt in order to take them down.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.160
Or if you have like a fancy, you know, black tie affair, like a wedding or something coming

10:48.160 --> 10:51.280
up, you can, you can ask them to borrow it because you don't want to clash.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.200
Um, I don't know what to zag as.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.280
I'm taking, I'm taking zag suggestions.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.920
You can't think about it too much as the thing.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.720
I have.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.760
I, I drove past that place and I didn't even plan to take a taekwondo class.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.800
The zag came to me.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.200
Yeah.

11:05.200 --> 11:09.280
I think if you're open to the zag, it'll, it'll come to you.

11:09.280 --> 11:14.800
Um, I did want to, uh, give a, uh, and maybe we'll do a few of these regularly.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.760
Uh, 2017 is the year we're zagging on them.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.080
They think we're going to zag, we zag.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.680
Yeah, zag watch, zag watch.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.840
Yeah, quick zag watch.

11:25.840 --> 11:31.520
I want to give a shout out to, uh, uh, Hallie, um, from, or perhaps Haley.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.600
It's, it's, it's hard to say, uh, uh, on in the Facebook group who has no black

11:37.600 --> 11:41.760
blacksmithing experience, but has decided that, uh, they're going to make several

11:41.760 --> 11:46.240
swords and attempt to sell them at the Bristol Renaissance Fair in Wisconsin, uh,

11:46.240 --> 11:46.880
Wisconsin.

11:46.880 --> 11:52.800
And just to prove it, there's a video of them just like making a sword on what

11:52.800 --> 11:54.160
appears to be a grill.

11:54.160 --> 11:59.520
Maybe it's, well, listen, I will buy that sword.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.760
I will buy a sword from you.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.080
Yeah.

12:02.080 --> 12:07.600
Um, get in contact, tweet at me and let me know how I can pay you to commission.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.720
So I'm going to say, I'm going to commission your 10th sword.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.560
I do not want your first one.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.600
Nobody wants your first.

12:13.600 --> 12:13.920
Fuck that.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.520
I'll take the first one and then I'll frame it.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.040
And then in 20 years when you're a master blacksmith, I'll hand it back to you.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.640
Fucking Bartlett for America style.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.160
Um, that's a good, that's a damn, that's a good zag.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.720
Wow.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.040
Great zag.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.240
It's a really good zag.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.280
Let's go, Griffin.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.320
I have an idea for you.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.680
Let me take your zag to you.

12:29.680 --> 12:29.920
Okay.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.120
Keep in mind that I have like two hours of free time a week.

12:33.120 --> 12:33.680
Yeah.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.280
You should start raising chickens.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.040
Ooh, that would be, well, my cat Defo murdered them.

12:39.040 --> 12:39.280
Defo.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.880
You put them in a thing.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.040
No, he'll, he'll break in like, um, it'll, it'll be bad.

12:45.040 --> 12:45.600
It'll be bad.

12:45.600 --> 12:45.920
Okay.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.120
Ostriches.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.560
Now we're, now we're cooking with gas.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.240
But it's bad gas and it's bad food that we're cooking, but we are, it is being cooked.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.640
I think we should do some questions since we did negative one last episode.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.440
Uh, yeah, let's get into it.

12:59.440 --> 13:03.360
Um, let me decide upfront though, just so people are waiting on it or not.

13:03.360 --> 13:08.320
Um, do we want to update the Fushigi Arts patronage or no?

13:08.320 --> 13:12.480
I haven't seen, I haven't seen anything that really blew my, I blew, blew my, you know,

13:12.480 --> 13:14.000
I saw lots of people buying them.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.920
Um, but I haven't, I haven't really seen, we can't just give it out to everybody.

13:17.920 --> 13:23.920
It's not some, these millennials and their participation trophies is just not going to

13:23.920 --> 13:24.880
happen with this one.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.960
I need to see that fucking, I, it doesn't have to be the best Fushigi I've ever seen,

13:28.960 --> 13:31.520
but I do need to see that fucking spark of life.

13:32.320 --> 13:38.480
I do want to compliment Will Far is the first Fushigi Art video that I've seen on our, uh,

13:38.480 --> 13:39.280
Facebook page.

13:39.280 --> 13:39.520
Okay.

13:39.520 --> 13:39.760
Yeah.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.920
But Will, the music that it's actually set to.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.240
Okay.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.520
But Will, guess what?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.960
There was a drop in the video.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.080
So like, I got to see that spark.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.400
I saw at least one drop in Will's video.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.240
And if I, if I see a drop, that just shows me that there's the sparks just not there

13:54.240 --> 13:54.480
yet.

13:54.480 --> 13:54.720
Will.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.480
I'm just adding him to the Fushigi Arts patronage list.

13:58.480 --> 14:03.120
If you make your own Fushigi Art, it has to be bespoke for us exclusively.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.920
And you can put it on our Facebook page, hashtag Fushigi Art or on Twitter hashtag Fushigi Art,

14:07.920 --> 14:13.040
but do include the hashtag Fushigi Art, or else we'll might, we won't be able to annex

14:13.040 --> 14:13.680
it and find it.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.480
God, this is the dumbest thing we've ever done.

14:17.280 --> 14:17.840
It's dumb.

14:17.840 --> 14:22.480
We're giving away $500, um, in chunks.

14:22.480 --> 14:28.000
Someone offered, emailed us to offer to donate more money to the Fushigi Art space patronage.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.840
And I had this moment.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.120
I had two moments.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.120
The first one was, hell yes, let's build this up.

14:35.120 --> 14:39.920
And then my other one was, oh no, this would snowball very quickly.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.320
Yeah.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.120
I cannot be, I have two full-time jobs.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.880
I cannot be, oversee the world's largest Fushigi Art.

14:48.240 --> 14:54.160
After a certain monetary amount, we would reach the point where anytime anything bad

14:54.160 --> 14:58.560
happened to anyone else in the world, we would feel pretty weird about how we've sort of

14:58.560 --> 15:05.040
channeled our philanthropy, uh, in this one very specific, very useless avenue.

15:05.040 --> 15:05.520
Yeah.

15:05.520 --> 15:05.920
All right.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.280
So we did no questions last week.

15:07.280 --> 15:14.320
So we're going to actually do some this week on our podcast of questions.

15:14.320 --> 15:19.520
I just received a robe as a Christmas gift and my God, how have I been living without

15:19.520 --> 15:19.920
one?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.840
It feels like a blanket is hugging you.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.880
Needless to say, I haven't gotten dressed today.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.200
Is that needless to say?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.920
However, I have a couple of friends coming by to hang out, watch a movie in a short while.

15:31.920 --> 15:36.000
My inclination is to put on real clothes, but then I thought maybe this is fine.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.680
First, is it my place there?

15:37.680 --> 15:39.120
It's my place they're coming to.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.280
It's not like a walk in someone's house and pajamas.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.760
Secondly, this is very much a let's watch a movie and chill and not let's have a serious

15:45.760 --> 15:46.560
conversation about life.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.680
Hang out third.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.800
Maybe I zig when they expect me to zag.

15:50.800 --> 15:55.120
Anyhow, I'll definitely have gone for it by the time you even see this email, but maybe

15:55.120 --> 15:59.600
you'll be able to vibe me for future situations like this pajama party in Portland.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.280
Yo, um, so many variables.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.400
Variables, huh?

16:06.400 --> 16:10.240
Because you're wearing pants under that bad boy, right?

16:10.240 --> 16:12.400
Because if not, you can't entertain folks.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.000
It doesn't seem like that's good to have that happen to them.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.200
It's very robe dependent, isn't it?

16:19.200 --> 16:22.560
I mean, I feel like if you show up in a...

16:22.560 --> 16:22.800
Okay.

16:23.680 --> 16:30.080
If I show up to a party and the host is wearing a silken robe, perhaps one that's heavily

16:30.080 --> 16:33.760
ornamented with some sorts of with embroidery, perhaps.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.040
Like a half there.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.320
Like a full half.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.440
Like a half kind of vibe, but like cool.

16:40.080 --> 16:45.120
So like if they did that, I think I would feel like this is going to pop off.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.680
Like this is going to be ribald to the max.

16:48.320 --> 16:54.080
I don't know that I would feel that way if it was like just like Garfield popping up

16:54.080 --> 16:55.040
from a pocket.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.360
It's like, I hate Monday, so I'm staying in my robe.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.680
And the robe was like had like lots of knits on it.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.400
Oh, shit.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.080
Mustard stains covered in Cheetos.

17:06.080 --> 17:11.040
Just lasagna stains on it to continue the Garfield sort of metaphor.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.400
And also it would have like a big streak of Odie's shit.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.000
It's just despicable.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.280
Yeah, it's just soaked in John's tears.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.040
It's robe dependent, I think.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.200
Well, I think the problem is you run the risk of your friends showing up and you giving

17:27.200 --> 17:29.920
off the vibe of like, I don't want you here.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.120
I wish you weren't here.

17:31.120 --> 17:31.520
Yeah, exactly.

17:31.520 --> 17:36.320
I'd rather just be laying around in my robe like you're really imposing.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.720
You want one that says, welcome to my boudoir.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.520
Like that's what you want.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.720
No, I don't think you want.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.040
No.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.960
Maybe in bright flashing letters.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.280
What the fuck is both of you talking about?

17:45.280 --> 17:46.400
Justin, especially.

17:46.960 --> 17:52.400
This was my main red flag that went up when this question was asked, which is like, you

17:52.400 --> 17:57.440
don't want your friends to think you're trying to get them down into the fucking grotto to

17:57.440 --> 17:59.600
like get to get weird on them.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.880
Especially when you use the phrase, watch a movie and chill.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.280
There are connotations to that these days.

18:05.280 --> 18:10.560
Yeah, for some reason, the millennials have taken that from us and now it means to have

18:10.560 --> 18:13.840
do sex stuff while Orange is the New Black plays in the background.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.560
Not sex.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.080
It doesn't have to be sex stuff.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.280
You just said the boudoir.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.640
What the fuck else does that mean?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.240
I meant to say bungalow.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.320
That's the problem.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.680
Welcome to my bungalow.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.760
Now we're getting somewhere.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.360
Now we're on habitation.

18:27.360 --> 18:32.560
Habitation, I think what I'm saying is, I don't think like sex stuff.

18:32.560 --> 18:38.320
I feel like if I show up in the hostess in a robe and they have like nice slippers, like,

18:38.320 --> 18:38.960
you know what I mean?

18:38.960 --> 18:40.160
Like nice.

18:40.160 --> 18:45.440
Then it's the kind of party where maybe some sorts of drugs that I would have no way of

18:45.440 --> 18:50.240
procuring otherwise might be exchanged and they'd be like in a T and it would be like

18:50.240 --> 18:52.720
so chill, you know, like it's that kind of scene.

18:52.720 --> 19:00.000
When was the last time you went to somebody else's house, Justin, that was not related?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.160
It's been a minute, huh?

19:04.800 --> 19:05.760
It's been a minute.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.040
Here's my advice.

19:09.040 --> 19:16.320
I would say that this is perfectly acceptable on the condition that ahead of time you make

19:16.320 --> 19:20.320
these plans with your friends like, hey, let's have a super chill day where we all like just

19:20.320 --> 19:25.280
hang out in pajamas and robes and like just like watch cartoons or whatever.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.720
Because I think that that's fine.

19:26.720 --> 19:31.600
But if they show up and they're like dressed, you know, like they're going out and hanging

19:31.600 --> 19:36.640
out and doing an event and they show up in urine pajamas and robe, then it's weird.

19:36.640 --> 19:41.920
But if everybody's having like a Saturday morning cartoon hangout, like let's just be

19:41.920 --> 19:46.160
chill, maybe naps will happen and we won't have to like end the party just because I

19:46.160 --> 19:47.280
want to take a nap.

19:47.280 --> 19:47.920
That's fine.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.720
You just have to establish that vibe beforehand.

19:51.280 --> 19:56.000
You also got to be careful what you're signaling, not to other people, but to yourself, right?

19:56.000 --> 20:03.760
Like if you put on a robe, part of the reason that feels so luxurious is the supposition

20:03.760 --> 20:05.840
that you now can't do anything.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.480
Like nothing can be expected of me.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.240
I'm wearing this robe.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.560
Like the world's got to take a backseat.

20:12.560 --> 20:16.400
If you start wearing a robe and then going about your day to day, one, you're going to

20:16.400 --> 20:18.320
lose the power of that connotation.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.520
You're going to think like, oh, I'm wearing a robe.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.960
This is what I do my taxes in.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.080
Like that's not going to be luxurious or pleasant for you at all.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.040
You're going to need an assortment of robes.

20:29.040 --> 20:34.800
You're going to need your tax robe, your laying around robe, your time to make the donuts robe.

20:37.360 --> 20:43.040
So you're suggesting that this person do it sort of in the Japanese style with a formal

20:43.040 --> 20:47.120
kimono and a semi-formal kimono and then one that you wear to funerals.

20:47.680 --> 20:47.920
Yep.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.680
That's exactly what I'm saying.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.040
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.800
I can't podcast in sweatpants.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.000
What?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.480
I can't podcast in sweatpants.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.720
I think it's sweatpants is robe adjacent.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.920
I can't podcast.

20:59.920 --> 21:06.000
If you've ever heard me on a podcast, like 99.9% of the time, almost without fail.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.440
Just pants?

21:07.440 --> 21:13.760
Unless my jeans were in the wash, I cannot podcast or do any work in sweatpants.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.720
It's always jeans.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.800
Wearing jeans right now, always jeans.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.680
Can't do it in sweatpants.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.160
That's insane.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.240
My body can't make the connection.

21:20.240 --> 21:20.720
You took that.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.080
You're on that Elizabeth Gilbert tip.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.720
She came to our podcast and told us not to wear sweatpants when we podcast.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.000
And Elizabeth, I'm very sorry.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.600
You are a bastion of great advice, but it's 10 44 AM and I need to do me.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.840
I need to do me, Elizabeth.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.240
I work out of my home.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.360
I have to keep the lines clear.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.960
I have to make those lines clear.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.920
I can't do it.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.960
And I think a robe might be kind of the same thing.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.280
I don't know.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.240
It's definitely the same thing.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.640
This person is a blanket that you wear.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.320
That is not work time stuff.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.960
That's not socialization time for sure.

21:54.960 --> 21:55.600
You don't want.

21:55.600 --> 21:59.360
But what I'm saying is if it is a robe hangout, if that's the event you're like,

21:59.360 --> 22:00.800
I did this with my friends on Christmas.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.280
Like come over.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.120
We're going to watch Christmas movies and hang out in our pajamas and eat Christmas cookies.

22:05.120 --> 22:11.120
Like cool, but not like a, hey, every time we hang out from now on, get used to this robe.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.200
Cause you'll always be seeing it forever.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.240
This is me now.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.160
Here's a good measuring stick.

22:16.160 --> 22:21.600
Imagine you open the door in a t-shirt and jeans and then at about an hour in you leave

22:21.600 --> 22:24.320
the room and return in a robe.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.840
Try to think about the signal that would send because I think that might make it a little

22:27.840 --> 22:28.880
clearer, right?

22:28.880 --> 22:34.240
Like if I said, somebody does that to me, I think, oh, I should, we should go.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.520
This is very passive aggressive, but you, you want us to go.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.160
We should go now.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.560
Um, can I do the Yahoo?

22:41.200 --> 22:41.840
Yes.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.200
It was sent in by Jeffrey Corbello.

22:43.200 --> 22:43.760
Thank you, Jeffrey.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Wilma.

22:45.120 --> 22:49.600
And I just want to give another shout out to the fucking Yahoo ad department because

22:49.600 --> 22:51.840
it's not telling me Melissa McCarthy's dead this time.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.800
Thank you.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
It's an advertisement for spam.

22:54.800 --> 23:01.440
And what I'm seeing here boys is just the sweatiest looking bowl of macaroni and cheese

23:01.440 --> 23:05.920
that, uh, has ever been devised on God's green earth.

23:05.920 --> 23:11.200
And there are just these sort of desperate islands of spam floating around in this bowl

23:11.200 --> 23:13.760
and it is maybe the gnarliest thing I've ever seen.

23:13.760 --> 23:19.200
And it also says save $1 on the advertisement and like how much could this possibly cost

23:19.200 --> 23:19.760
me?

23:19.760 --> 23:24.000
I don't want to get all prices righty on me here, but damn, this is a gnarly looking

23:24.000 --> 23:25.680
bowl of food stuff that you have shown me.

23:25.680 --> 23:30.240
It's just a visually challenging website every time I visit it now and I can't wait

23:30.240 --> 23:31.520
for it to die.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.680
Speaking of spam, I just have to say this real quick.

23:33.680 --> 23:39.280
I got an email about a voice changer with effects app that is spam.

23:39.280 --> 23:46.960
And the icon of this fake account is Guy Fieri pointing at me directly.

23:46.960 --> 23:52.720
And the subject line of the spam email is, all caps, this is spam.

23:52.720 --> 23:53.440
Don't judge.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.240
All right.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.760
That's a new game.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.320
Zag.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.600
I clicked through.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.960
You got me on that one.

24:00.960 --> 24:01.920
That's quite a zag.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.520
Oh, I thought of a zag I did this week.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.480
I didn't even bring up.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.720
I watched Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on demand.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.280
It wasn't just on and I just had the TV on.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.520
I sought out the triple D.

24:17.520 --> 24:24.640
You pouted your fist on your sweaty, cheese dust coated fist on the table and said, I

24:24.640 --> 24:27.440
demand to watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.040
It was 3.30 in the morning.

24:29.040 --> 24:33.360
I got on Kayak.com and bought a fucking one-way ticket to Flavortown.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.800
Did you actually do this at 3.30 in the morning?

24:38.800 --> 24:39.440
Yeah.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.480
That's when Henry likes to party with his Uncle Guy.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.080
All right.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.440
It's so cute.

24:47.440 --> 24:51.760
He pulls his sunglasses off his head, but then they just snap directly back on that

24:51.760 --> 24:52.560
cool strap.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.680
Wilma asks, need, oh, and this is in Yahoo!

24:57.680 --> 25:00.480
Products, Yahoo! Mail, sending and receiving messages.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.200
So I think it's time we give back to the community.

25:03.200 --> 25:07.920
Wilma asks, need email that I sent to Gary Spangler.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.280
Need email that I sent to Gary Spangler.

25:13.280 --> 25:19.680
We never do like IT, you know, technology advice here.

25:19.680 --> 25:25.440
Wilma has sent a delicate email to Gary Spangler and we all do this in the heat of passion.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.360
We click that send button and we think, oh, gosh, I shouldn't have clicked that send button

25:29.360 --> 25:31.440
on this Yahoo! Mail service I use.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.080
How do we get this email?

25:34.080 --> 25:37.120
Is it F-P-A-N-G-L-E-R?

25:37.120 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.720
Are you trying to look him up and like, what are you doing?

25:40.720 --> 25:43.920
Like a social hacking where you call him and ask him to delete all his emails?

25:43.920 --> 25:44.960
Don't you worry about it.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.240
Oh, Jesus.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.280
No, I'm worried about it.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.520
Well, okay.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.520
There's a Gary Spangler.

25:55.520 --> 25:59.600
Oh, God, Trav, this is getting, I don't want to do anything to Gary Spangler.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.840
Well, no, but I want to make sure that we are not talking about like an actual person

26:03.840 --> 26:06.480
that might, this might get worse.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.800
You said a full name, Griffin.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.840
You just said a first and last name in this Yahoo! answer.

26:11.840 --> 26:12.080
So what?

26:12.080 --> 26:13.520
There's lots of Gary Spanglers.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.720
We didn't say like Gary Spangler from the Bronx.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.560
Well, this is what's interesting to me, Griffin.

26:18.560 --> 26:25.520
When I Google that name, the first 10 responses are like all the same dude.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.720
Oh, maybe it's Gary Spangler then.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.480
So say we said-

26:30.480 --> 26:32.960
Spangler with an E or Spangler with an A?

26:32.960 --> 26:34.240
A, Spangler with an A.

26:34.880 --> 26:42.480
So say we sent him a delicate email and we are an old person and we just need that email

26:42.480 --> 26:47.520
back very much because there was stuff in there that, in vino veritas, you know, sipping

26:47.520 --> 26:56.240
those mai tais and we got some of that liquid courage and so we sent an email to Gary Spangler,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.720
but we shouldn't have sent the Spangler missive.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.680
How do I retrieve it through Yahoo!'s mail service?

27:07.040 --> 27:13.280
I think if you just email him again with the subject line undo, I think it just does it.

27:13.280 --> 27:19.040
Oh, you have to type the whole email backwards and then send it to him and that will erase it.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.880
You're saying an anti-email.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.080
Fascinating stuff.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.520
I also think you can just respond,

27:27.520 --> 27:29.200
Hey, Gary, sorry about that.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.560
My kid was on the computer.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.400
Have no idea what they sent you.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.680
Anyways, hit me back.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.080
Love, Wilma.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.120
Love, Wilma.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.560
That wasn't me again.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.240
I would never say that to you, Gary.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.440
I hate you.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.200
He can't put that genie back to the bottom.

27:45.200 --> 27:49.360
I mean, sending an opposite email that deletes the other email is not a thing,

27:49.360 --> 27:53.040
but if you send them another email with the exact opposite sentiment,

27:53.040 --> 27:57.440
you zagged on them and they're not going to know which sentiment is the real sentiment.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.760
God, I wish I hadn't sent that fucking email to Gary Spangler.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.560
He won't forgive.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.160
He won't forget he's Gary Spangler.

28:06.160 --> 28:10.480
He's Gary Spangler and his alarm is strong.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.600
He can hold both emails in his mind at one time

28:13.600 --> 28:15.680
and know that I both love him and hate him.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.120
Damn you, Gary Spangler.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.120
Damn your strong alarm.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.320
How do I get this fucking email back from Gary Spangler?

28:22.320 --> 28:23.440
You guys aren't helping me at all.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.360
You can't, Griffin, you can't.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.040
So what you need to do,

28:27.040 --> 28:30.080
you have to bury it in the avalanche of other emails.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.040
Oh my God.

28:31.040 --> 28:36.400
Okay. You just have to start like sending just constant email,

28:36.400 --> 28:38.640
cut and paste passages from Shakespeare.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.120
You know what I mean?

28:39.120 --> 28:41.760
Just send him content after content

28:41.760 --> 28:46.000
until eventually that one email doesn't even register to Gary Spangler

28:46.000 --> 28:49.520
because he's received thousands of emails from you.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.360
Gary Spangler's staying at a nice hotel

28:51.360 --> 28:54.080
and there's something going on in the ballroom,

28:54.080 --> 28:55.680
some sort of conference he doesn't really understand.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.720
So he pokes his head in and says,

28:58.720 --> 29:00.240
hi everybody, my name's Gary Spangler

29:00.240 --> 29:01.280
and I'm just wondering what you're...

29:01.280 --> 29:03.680
And everybody in the room goes like, what?

29:03.680 --> 29:05.440
You're the Gary Spangler?

29:05.440 --> 29:08.480
Because the conference is for porn bot developers

29:08.480 --> 29:11.680
and this man has been made famous through his minis.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.720
Dude, you put my kids through college.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.840
Thank you, Gary Spangler.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.080
What was in this fucking email to Gary Spangler though?

29:23.040 --> 29:26.320
Because now this Wilma's got like eyewitnesses now.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.800
Like now she's got a paper trail

29:28.800 --> 29:30.240
leading back to Gary Spangler.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.800
Oh yeah, and she's claimed the crime too.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.240
You can't erase this from Yahoo.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.760
Forget how do you get it back from Yahoo Mail,

29:35.760 --> 29:37.280
how do you get it back from Yahoo Answers?

29:37.280 --> 29:38.080
Yeah.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.840
Gary Spangler, okay, Gary Spangler is gonna Google himself.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.200
Yeah, definitely.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.240
Gary Spangler's gonna Google himself.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.440
He's gonna see this Wilma.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.080
And then he's gonna come to you.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.360
What was that email, Wilma?

29:49.360 --> 29:51.440
I couldn't find it because my email box,

29:51.440 --> 29:54.880
the inbox is just a blighted wasteland of pornography.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.240
That's how I say that.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.720
You burned my email from the inside out, Wilma.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.800
It's poison inside, it's toxic inside of there, Wilma.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.960
No one ever goes in, no one ever comes out.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
I had e-business to do on there.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.640
Just kidding, we're both 96.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.360
It's too bad, Wilma, I've always loved you.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.280
I thought maybe you felt the same.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.680
Maybe if I'd gotten an email from you

30:21.680 --> 30:24.240
that had not been retrieved or buried in pornography.

30:25.280 --> 30:25.760
Damn it.

30:25.760 --> 30:30.560
Damn it, damn it, Wilma, I'm Gary Spangler.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.760
Nobody treats me this way.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.800
I feel like you guys aren't into Gary Spangler

30:34.800 --> 30:36.000
as much as I am.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.760
You've built a rich mythology in your head

30:37.760 --> 30:39.680
that I'm trying desperately to access.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.720
Oh, just jump on the fucking Spang train, baby.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.480
There's room for all of us on here.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.720
We can put all our hopes and dreams into Gary Spangler.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.720
I mean, I believe in him.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.240
That's not the question, right?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.400
Like I believe in Gary Spangler.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.040
The question is, does Gary Spangler believe in me?

30:55.520 --> 30:56.320
Damn it.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.760
Here's another question for you guys, my brothers.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.240
I was recently on a long road trip

31:02.240 --> 31:04.080
and about halfway through I passed a driver

31:04.080 --> 31:06.800
whose car's fuel door was open.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.880
I wanted to figure out some way to let the driver know

31:08.880 --> 31:10.640
without freaking them out and making them think

31:10.640 --> 31:12.960
there was some worse problem with their car,

31:12.960 --> 31:15.280
but I failed to do so before I was out of sight.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.640
What's the best way to quickly let a filler driver know

31:18.640 --> 31:19.280
about a small problem with their car?

31:19.280 --> 31:20.880
Oh, a filler driver.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.800
A filler driver.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.760
Yeah, I don't know about a small problem with your car

31:26.320 --> 31:27.920
without freaking them out.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.800
Thanks for your help.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.960
Terrible Southern driver.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.960
See, I sense the Southern coming.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.200
Yeah.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.320
I try to inject it.

31:35.040 --> 31:40.640
Damn, we gotta all get down on trucker life.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.520
I'm in my Volkswagen Golf.

31:43.520 --> 31:48.000
I wanna get a CB radio and we all need one, don't we?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.800
Just for situations like these.

31:51.920 --> 31:52.960
This is no joke.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.200
One time I saw that I was,

31:55.200 --> 31:57.040
this is when I worked at a place in Charleston

31:57.040 --> 31:58.240
and I was driving back and forth

31:58.240 --> 32:00.480
between Huntington and Charleston every day.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.880
And I saw a car with their fuel door open

32:02.880 --> 32:06.000
and the gas cap fluttering in the wind.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.000
So I called dad at the radio station and said,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.320
hey dad, could you announce on the radio

32:12.320 --> 32:14.160
that if someone's driving to Charleston

32:14.160 --> 32:17.600
in this makeup car, color of car,

32:17.600 --> 32:18.480
that they're casting.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.440
This license plate.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
And this motherfucker did it.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.720
Dad did that.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.120
Dad.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.880
That's inappropriate use.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.400
That's narrow casting.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.640
It's a violation of FCC law.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.360
That's no good.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.960
So if you see this, just call my dad

32:34.960 --> 32:36.640
and tell him to announce it on the radio.

32:36.640 --> 32:37.440
That's what I did.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.920
As far as I see it, there are two options.

32:39.920 --> 32:44.000
One, you do a fucking sick ass transporter style.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.800
Oh, you can press a button to pop up in your own fuel door

32:46.800 --> 32:49.280
and then you spin your car 180 degrees

32:49.280 --> 32:50.880
and drive side by side with them

32:50.880 --> 32:52.720
and high five them so that they push each other

32:52.720 --> 32:53.920
back into place.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.200
That's one option.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.400
It's tough to do.

32:56.400 --> 32:59.040
The other option is we all just start rocking CB radios

32:59.040 --> 33:01.040
because you know on Star Trek,

33:01.040 --> 33:03.200
whenever they see another ship, then they hail them.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.960
I want to do that from my golf to somebody's Jetta.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.800
It's Griffin in the golf.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.640
You ever think there's a moment in Star Trek

33:12.640 --> 33:14.000
where they hail another ship

33:14.000 --> 33:15.280
and the other ship is surprised

33:15.280 --> 33:17.040
that their ship could do that?

33:17.040 --> 33:18.400
Like, what is that?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.760
What's that beeping?

33:19.760 --> 33:20.320
That's crazy.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.280
Someone investigate that.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.120
Like, we've been in space.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.520
We haven't seen another ship for like 10 years.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.560
Yeah, that's crazy.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.040
Space.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.240
I have definitely, Griffin, had the exact thought

33:30.240 --> 33:31.920
on like not as a joke,

33:31.920 --> 33:33.920
the exact thought you're describing of like,

33:33.920 --> 33:34.320
you know what?

33:34.320 --> 33:36.480
I'm on this lonesome road with these other cars.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.480
I wish I could just like hail the car

33:38.480 --> 33:40.160
and just like see what's going on.

33:40.160 --> 33:45.760
And then I realized like, I don't do that in life.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.440
This car you call a body.

33:48.720 --> 33:49.600
Exactly.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.720
In my body car that I'm driving with my spirit,

33:52.720 --> 33:54.320
I don't like do that.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.760
Like, I could do that.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.680
Like, I could hail someone at Starbucks

33:57.680 --> 33:59.040
and just say like,

33:59.040 --> 34:00.400
hey, you know what?

34:00.400 --> 34:02.480
We're both at Starbucks was your story.

34:02.480 --> 34:03.200
I don't do that.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.640
But for some reason, if I can like do a Huey

34:06.640 --> 34:07.840
and slam on the brakes

34:07.840 --> 34:10.320
and put them into the Eververse,

34:10.320 --> 34:12.080
I can no longer see or hear them.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.080
Pick this body up at an old junkyard.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.240
She's not the fastest ship in the verse,

34:16.240 --> 34:18.160
but she gets the job done.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.680
There's a lot of love at this hull.

34:21.200 --> 34:24.800
It would be fun to also be able to shut down hailing frequency.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.280
That's the move that I really do want to be able to do,

34:27.280 --> 34:29.200
to be able to open hailing channels,

34:29.200 --> 34:31.760
to be able to discuss with them how things are going.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.960
And then when things go rogue,

34:32.960 --> 34:35.600
just like close frequencies.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.120
Ray Shields.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.680
Ray Shields calms down.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.800
Divert calm power to Shields.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.240
Fire across their bow.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.120
Divert calm power to Shields

34:47.120 --> 34:48.480
and then you just start honking.

34:48.480 --> 34:48.800
What?

34:50.880 --> 34:52.080
Those are my Shields.

34:52.080 --> 34:52.800
Those are my Shields.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.280
Great job.

34:54.160 --> 34:54.640
Great job.

34:56.240 --> 34:56.880
We would need it.

34:56.880 --> 34:57.840
You can't use the great job horn for this.

34:57.840 --> 34:58.720
I mean, we would need a...

34:59.920 --> 35:00.480
What do we have?

35:00.480 --> 35:02.240
We have the great job horn.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.000
We have the fuck you horn.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.880
And then we have the...

35:04.880 --> 35:07.040
We just have the general alert horn.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.960
And this is another problem

35:08.960 --> 35:11.440
that would be fixed by this trihorn system

35:11.440 --> 35:12.800
where if you heard the alert horn,

35:12.800 --> 35:15.440
you would check your fucking car out for all of it

35:15.440 --> 35:16.320
and you would see...

35:16.320 --> 35:18.560
You don't need a horn that's like your gas door is open.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.080
You just need the alert horn.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.680
And if you get tagged with that,

35:21.680 --> 35:23.200
you know to check your shit out.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.720
Pull over and check your shit out

35:24.720 --> 35:25.760
because there's something wrong.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.680
God, Honda, get at me.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.560
Volkswagen.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.160
You are dealing with a lot of stuff right now,

35:30.160 --> 35:31.360
but fucking get at me.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.840
You're still hanging on to Volkswagen, huh?

35:33.840 --> 35:34.160
Yeah.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.760
They're begging to take it back

35:35.760 --> 35:37.040
and you just want to keep killing Earth.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.560
Well, I'll get it fixed.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.800
I'll devise my own system.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.040
I'll put a fucking Brita filter up in there.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.640
I just divested myself of my Beetle on Friday.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.040
Oh, yeah.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.480
And let me say, the lady who took it back

35:54.480 --> 35:56.640
did not seem very jazzed to be there.

35:56.640 --> 35:56.880
Yeah.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.480
Seemed like maybe it's kind of a tough...

35:59.040 --> 36:00.560
Kind of a tough time for them.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.760
To be in that gig.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.920
Well, maybe you shouldn't have sold me a Lycar.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.280
A car full of lies.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.320
Car full of lies.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.520
Thank you for taking it back, though.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.280
I didn't have room for my card seat in it.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.480
It was kind of a bad choice.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.240
I mean, mine's kicky and fun to drive

36:12.240 --> 36:14.320
and it's got a lot of get up and go

36:14.320 --> 36:15.520
and great mileage,

36:15.520 --> 36:17.120
but it's full of fucking lies, so...

36:17.840 --> 36:18.560
That's your problem.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.680
That's your problem now.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.480
Hey, can we go to the money zone?

36:22.480 --> 36:23.200
Yeah, follow me.

36:23.200 --> 36:34.400
I'll show you the way.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.520
You ready for a zag?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.120
I got a zag for you.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.800
The original Chuckle Boys would like to talk to you about investment.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.240
We're all adults now.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.120
Yeah, well, I mean, some of us are...

36:45.120 --> 36:46.960
We're put on a very prestigious list

36:46.960 --> 36:48.640
and I don't want to keep dropping it

36:48.640 --> 36:50.000
like several times per episode,

36:50.000 --> 36:51.440
but the list is prestigious.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.600
And you know it is because I'm pronouncing that word

36:53.600 --> 36:55.280
the correct way now, finally.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.320
Bill Gates, Bill and Melinda Gates came to my house

36:58.320 --> 36:59.760
and said, you've been pronouncing that word wrong

36:59.760 --> 37:01.360
now that you're on that very prestigious list.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.320
That's how you're supposed to say it.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.720
Anyway, they told me Betterment...

37:04.720 --> 37:06.080
Well, I shouldn't say that.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.040
Betterment is what you're gonna have to use

37:09.040 --> 37:11.440
to manage your portfolio

37:11.440 --> 37:15.200
because they just want you to have that good, good money

37:16.400 --> 37:18.720
using a system that is lower cost

37:18.720 --> 37:19.920
than other financial services

37:19.920 --> 37:21.600
and it's easy to use.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.080
Nobody understands investing except for...

37:24.640 --> 37:26.080
I mean, some people do, I guess.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.080
And included in that very small number

37:29.200 --> 37:31.600
is not you, but is Betterment.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.000
It's a better way to invest your money

37:34.000 --> 37:35.120
and it's your money.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.640
You should understand where it's going.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.960
They combined time-tested investing principles

37:38.960 --> 37:41.760
with the transparency and ease of use

37:41.760 --> 37:43.440
you expect from great technology

37:43.440 --> 37:45.760
focusing on lower fees and taxes.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.360
Because if you're paying fees,

37:47.360 --> 37:48.480
it's losing...

37:48.480 --> 37:49.600
You're missing the point.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.080
Right.

37:50.080 --> 37:50.640
You know what I mean?

37:50.640 --> 37:53.040
Like, I've only been investing

37:53.040 --> 37:54.240
since I've been on the prestigious list,

37:54.240 --> 37:55.600
which has not been very, very long.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.640
But I do know that that, fungibly,

37:58.640 --> 37:59.520
just doesn't...

37:59.520 --> 38:01.200
That just doesn't add up.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.240
Now, we do wanna be upfront.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.080
Investing involves risk, right?

38:06.080 --> 38:06.640
There's no...

38:06.640 --> 38:07.120
What?

38:07.120 --> 38:08.400
Yes, there's no guarantee.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.280
I just invested all my...

38:09.280 --> 38:09.760
Great.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.840
But it does involve risk.

38:11.840 --> 38:16.320
But right now, you can get one month managed free

38:16.320 --> 38:17.680
and to find out what you need to do

38:17.680 --> 38:20.000
to qualify for that one month of free management,

38:20.000 --> 38:24.800
just go to Betterment.com slash MBMBAM.

38:24.800 --> 38:29.600
That's Betterment.com slash MBMBAM.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.240
Betterment, investing made better.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.720
I really don't know anything about money.

38:34.720 --> 38:38.080
So a service that helps me out with that

38:38.800 --> 38:40.640
using technology,

38:41.120 --> 38:43.600
it sounds like a pretty great thing to me.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.800
As far as I'm concerned,

38:44.800 --> 38:48.000
this may as well be an advertisement for a wizard school.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.960
Another thing that I don't really know about,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.760
but it would be cool if someone could help me out with it.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.560
I wanna tell everybody about Squarespace.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.280
Websites are getting pretty hot,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.160
and you're probably wondering how everybody's making them,

39:02.160 --> 39:04.960
because it doesn't seem to be a button on your computer

39:04.960 --> 39:06.160
or anything like that.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.840
The secret is Squarespace.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.320
We're supported by Squarespace.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.160
So yes, we're a bit biased,

39:12.160 --> 39:15.520
yes, we're a bit biased, but it's time for you to,

39:15.520 --> 39:17.680
this is a copy here, I didn't make this up.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.800
Make your next move, make your next website.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.960
That's right, it's time to zag.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.160
Even Squarespace knows that you need to make a website

39:26.160 --> 39:29.520
this week that's gonna zag people in a pretty wild way.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.080
These are award-winning templates,

39:32.080 --> 39:33.760
and they're the most beautiful way

39:33.760 --> 39:35.920
to present your ideas online,

39:35.920 --> 39:39.040
and it's an all-in-one platform.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.920
You can make beautiful websites with this platform,

39:41.920 --> 39:43.200
and then there's nothing to install,

39:43.200 --> 39:45.760
you don't patch, you don't upgrade ever,

39:45.760 --> 39:48.800
and it's got award-winning 24-7 customer support.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.280
You should make a website, at least.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.720
I should do this,

39:54.720 --> 39:57.360
because I just went to griffinmacaroy.com,

39:57.360 --> 40:00.880
which I remembered redirects to my Tumblr,

40:00.880 --> 40:03.280
which I have not updated since September,

40:03.280 --> 40:05.040
and one of the top things on there

40:05.040 --> 40:08.720
is a list of Overwatch characters

40:08.720 --> 40:11.040
with Monster Factory names on them,

40:11.040 --> 40:15.600
and so if you see me on the Forbes 30 Under 30,

40:15.600 --> 40:16.720
and you say,

40:16.720 --> 40:19.280
I wanna know more about this young media luminary,

40:19.280 --> 40:21.680
one of the very first things you see at griffinmacaroy.com

40:21.680 --> 40:24.240
is a picture of Soldier 76 from Overwatch

40:24.240 --> 40:27.280
with the name Grandpa Piss on it,

40:27.280 --> 40:31.120
and that's one of my first sort of brand representations.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.600
Need to fix that.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.240
Justin, what website would you make on Squarespace?

40:37.040 --> 40:40.000
Well, I can't fucking do justinmacaroy.com

40:40.000 --> 40:41.360
because Justin Macaroy got it.

40:44.080 --> 40:44.560
I'm sorry, bud.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.520
He's my archenemy.

40:45.520 --> 40:46.960
He works for CBC Vancouver.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.320
People tweet at me at crimes

40:50.320 --> 40:52.400
getting done in Vancouver all the time.

40:52.400 --> 40:52.880
That's cool.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.560
And I try to investigate it myself.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.680
It seems like a pretty good platform

40:57.680 --> 40:59.280
for me to start investigating crime.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.280
You should have invited him out to the Vancouver show.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.640
He could have jumped his ass.

41:03.360 --> 41:03.860
Yeah.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.200
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:05.200 --> 41:06.800
welcome to the stage Justin Macaroy,

41:06.800 --> 41:08.960
and I'm just in the back getting blazed.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.080
Yeah, I have a message here,

41:12.080 --> 41:13.680
and it's for Julie Lange.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.920
Wait, did we give the thing, the free trial thing?

41:15.920 --> 41:17.200
Oh, farts.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.520
I hope so, but if not, you can get a free-

41:19.520 --> 41:20.000
Here, let me try again.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.160
No, I'll do it because you fucked up.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.640
You guys didn't even ask me what website I would make,

41:24.640 --> 41:26.000
and I thought of a real humdinger.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.360
All right, Travis, what website would you make?

41:28.160 --> 41:30.960
I would make a website about my conspiracy theory

41:30.960 --> 41:34.880
that Chuck the Show is a reboot of the Computer War 10 issues,

41:35.840 --> 41:38.720
and I would call all of my readers

41:38.720 --> 41:39.280
chuckolds.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.240
So if you want to get a free trial

41:42.240 --> 41:44.080
and 10% off your first purchase,

41:44.080 --> 41:46.640
you can visit squarespace.com slash my brother.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.920
Don't be a chuckold about it.

41:48.960 --> 41:51.120
I have a message here for Julie Lange,

41:51.120 --> 41:53.200
and it's from Charlie Lange, who says,

41:53.200 --> 41:54.000
Hi, Mom.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.080
Hope you're having fun while I'm off at college.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.240
I know Dad won't listen to Blather with you,

41:58.800 --> 42:00.480
but I'm still your podcast buddy,

42:00.480 --> 42:02.240
even if I'm half a country away.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.960
Also, sorry to Travis for that dinner invitation in June,

42:04.960 --> 42:07.760
but Ma dared me, and I'm way too easily bribed.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.880
Hope this message makes up for it, Ma.

42:10.880 --> 42:11.840
Firm handshake.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.960
Love, your pumpkin.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.400
And that's very sweet, and it's supposed to go up in January.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.200
So what's up now, Charlie and Julie?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.160
We crushed it.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.040
Travis, do you remember this din-din invitation?

42:23.040 --> 42:23.680
I do.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.600
I believe they tweeted at me or emailed me

42:25.600 --> 42:28.240
to let me know that they were in Los Angeles

42:28.240 --> 42:31.040
while I was still there and offered to take me out.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.400
And I didn't do that,

42:32.400 --> 42:34.880
and I don't want the Lange to take it personally.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.280
No.

42:35.280 --> 42:38.560
I don't like interacting with humans in that way.

42:39.280 --> 42:39.600
No.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.400
I mean, one out of every hundred people on Twitter

42:42.400 --> 42:46.960
will just be a skin taker, and it's not you.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.000
I know it's not you, Charlie,

42:48.000 --> 42:51.920
but if there was a 1% chance, would you throw it all away?

42:51.920 --> 42:53.280
Would you have the courage?

42:53.280 --> 42:53.680
I don't think so.

42:53.680 --> 42:57.040
If you have one shot but not have your skin taken,

42:57.040 --> 42:57.840
would you take it?

42:59.440 --> 43:01.040
Well, I have a personal message too,

43:01.040 --> 43:02.000
as long as we're throwing these around.

43:02.000 --> 43:02.400
Yeah, sure.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.600
It's for Brandon Mueller, 2004.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.400
And it's from BB Bearded Bro Rye Rye.

43:12.400 --> 43:12.560
Yeah.

43:12.560 --> 43:13.120
Rye Rye.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.880
Hi, Brandon.

43:14.880 --> 43:15.440
I love you.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.880
Hope you grow up big and stretch your arm strong.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.560
If you ever get the time,

43:20.560 --> 43:22.640
you should play some MechWar online with me,

43:22.640 --> 43:23.840
roleplay servers only,

43:24.400 --> 43:25.760
and by the time this comes out,

43:25.760 --> 43:27.680
I'll be most likely living in the woods again

43:27.680 --> 43:29.120
without high bandwidth internet,

43:29.120 --> 43:30.480
so I might need help.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.160
Come find me.

43:32.160 --> 43:32.560
P.S.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.080
See you in hell.

43:34.080 --> 43:34.800
Winky face.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.040
Is this actually-

43:37.040 --> 43:40.240
And the preferred time frame is night, afternoon, time.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.840
Which is my favorite part of the whole thing.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.360
Is this...

43:45.360 --> 43:46.000
Okay.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.680
Was this email supposed to be sent through time channels

43:50.480 --> 43:52.000
to actually land in 2004?

43:52.000 --> 43:52.480
Okay.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.360
Cool, cool, cool.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.800
Regardless, we were paid for it,

43:54.800 --> 43:57.040
so I could care less, honestly.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.320
My job here is done.

43:58.320 --> 43:58.560
Yeah.

43:58.560 --> 44:01.840
It might also have been generated by some kind of bot

44:01.840 --> 44:05.280
that just collected every 10th word it saw on Twitter

44:05.280 --> 44:07.280
and strung it into some kind of message.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.000
That makes a lot of sense to me.

44:10.000 --> 44:36.240
Yeah, that tracks.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.000
Hey, I have one Yahoo here,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.160
and it's from Morgan Navy. Keep it waving, Morgan Navy.

44:40.160 --> 44:40.400
Thank you.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.720
Sting has come to save Yahoo Answers.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.200
And look at that.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.800
The profile picture is the wrestler Sting

44:46.800 --> 44:47.760
with his fun makeup.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.680
Sting, the wrestler, asks,

44:52.880 --> 44:56.080
is there any way to take a good mug shot?

44:56.880 --> 44:59.840
I know it's never a good thing to get arrested,

44:59.840 --> 45:01.280
but it happens, right?

45:01.280 --> 45:01.780
Nah.

45:03.280 --> 45:06.880
So what would your attitude be like going in for your mug shot?

45:06.880 --> 45:08.560
Would you just try to make the best of it

45:08.560 --> 45:10.400
and take a good pic or still be sad?

45:12.560 --> 45:15.520
Nobody wants to get arrested, but everyone does.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.480
Not as much true that sentiment.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.640
The secret to a good one,

45:24.640 --> 45:26.240
I've seen a lot of celeb mug shots,

45:26.240 --> 45:28.800
and I think the secret is you got to have a facial expression

45:28.800 --> 45:31.440
that says, I bet I'm famous by now,

45:31.440 --> 45:34.560
because otherwise it won't happen for you.

45:34.560 --> 45:34.880
Yeah.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.520
You know what I mean?

45:35.520 --> 45:37.360
Like, that's sort of like the secret.

45:37.360 --> 45:41.920
Like, take the mug shot that you feel like expresses

45:41.920 --> 45:43.360
the life that you want to have,

45:43.360 --> 45:44.880
not the one that you do have currently.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.120
An aspirational mug shot,

45:47.120 --> 45:49.600
which should be a great compliment to the domain

45:49.600 --> 45:51.760
I do own, sexymugshots.com.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.800
Every time I press S on my keyboard

45:54.800 --> 45:56.000
while Google Chrome is open,

45:56.000 --> 45:57.040
it autofills to that,

45:57.040 --> 46:00.480
and I keep reminding myself it is a domain that you,

46:00.480 --> 46:04.640
a madman, owns and not some weird fetish I got into.

46:04.640 --> 46:08.800
Like, three years ago that Google Chrome remembers.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.440
If you want to see our YouTube videos,

46:11.440 --> 46:13.600
the most recent one came out seven months ago.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.320
Sorry.

46:14.320 --> 46:14.880
Oops.

46:14.880 --> 46:16.240
We should probably do better at that.

46:16.240 --> 46:16.480
Yeah.

46:16.480 --> 46:21.360
Because sexymugshots.com is the only URL you need.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.800
I love your idea about aspirational superstar mug shots, though,

46:24.800 --> 46:29.200
because I would go with the Tim Allen sort of rugged,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.200
true grit ass cowboy man mug shot.

46:33.200 --> 46:33.920
Mm-hmm.

46:33.920 --> 46:34.960
You see that, and you think like,

46:34.960 --> 46:36.960
this guy's A, gonna be a home improvement star,

46:36.960 --> 46:39.040
and also handsome as just all get out.

46:39.920 --> 46:40.880
I'm looking at it now,

46:40.880 --> 46:45.120
and this is the most handsome Tim Allen has ever, ever looked.

46:45.120 --> 46:48.000
There's also the handsome mug shot guy who happened last year,

46:48.560 --> 46:50.960
and now he's been released from prison,

46:50.960 --> 46:53.440
and now he has like a Bugatti or something.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.760
People are just like crazy about this guy and his handsome face.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.760
So I think there's a lot of opportunities there.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.800
You know, if it were me,

46:59.520 --> 47:02.160
what I would do when I had a mug shot taken,

47:02.160 --> 47:05.520
is try to like screw my face up into like a weird face,

47:05.520 --> 47:07.040
and like mess my hair all up,

47:07.040 --> 47:08.880
and like mess my beard all up,

47:08.880 --> 47:14.000
and try to look as unrecognizable as possible in my mug shot.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.760
And then as soon as the mug shot was taken,

47:15.760 --> 47:17.120
I'd like shave my beard,

47:17.120 --> 47:18.720
and like get my hair cut short,

47:18.720 --> 47:20.800
and like bleach it blonde,

47:20.800 --> 47:22.000
and maybe like, you know,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.480
wipe off that fake face tattoo I had,

47:25.040 --> 47:25.680
that kind of thing.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.520
Because then the next time someone saw my mug shot,

47:27.520 --> 47:28.640
they're like, oh, that's not me.

47:28.640 --> 47:28.960
Hmm.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.480
That's a really great,

47:30.480 --> 47:31.760
that's actually not a bad,

47:31.760 --> 47:32.800
they wouldn't let you do that,

47:32.800 --> 47:33.840
but it's like-

47:33.840 --> 47:35.200
Yes, like a good idea.

47:35.200 --> 47:35.760
It's a good idea.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.080
They explicitly wouldn't let you do that.

47:38.080 --> 47:39.440
Maybe that's why Tim Allen shaved off

47:39.440 --> 47:42.560
that Jeff Bridges true gray ass cowboy mustache

47:42.560 --> 47:44.320
that he had in the sexy picture.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.160
Do you guys think that,

47:46.160 --> 47:47.760
do you guys have it in your area,

47:47.760 --> 47:50.560
the magazine that they sell at the gas station?

47:50.560 --> 47:50.720
Oh yes, oh yes.

47:50.720 --> 47:52.480
Okay, so this is like a common thing everywhere, right?

47:52.480 --> 47:53.600
It's not just here in Huntington.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.320
The mug shot magazine?

47:56.320 --> 47:57.600
If I could fit it, like what I was,

47:57.600 --> 48:00.400
I'm talking about the magazine they sell at the gas station

48:00.400 --> 48:02.640
that has pictures of everybody's mug shots

48:02.640 --> 48:03.680
that are just like,

48:03.680 --> 48:07.200
someone realized that that was a free renewable resource,

48:07.200 --> 48:09.840
and they decided to bring that hot property.

48:09.840 --> 48:12.320
Not sure what the market is there.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.360
Like I would love to see some down on their luck people

48:15.360 --> 48:18.160
who made some pretty bad mistakes.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.000
I would love to see just sort of a cattle,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.680
a yearbook of them, of sad thing, of sad stuff.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.160
I would say, I have an idea.

48:26.160 --> 48:29.840
I have an idea.

48:29.840 --> 48:33.840
Guys, what if we combined mug shots

48:34.640 --> 48:37.760
and Instagram filters or Snapchat filters?

48:39.120 --> 48:39.600
What do you mean?

48:39.600 --> 48:40.240
You know what I mean?

48:40.240 --> 48:42.320
So like you took your mug shot

48:42.320 --> 48:44.560
and then like a rainbow was coming out of your mouth.

48:44.560 --> 48:44.880
What?

48:46.000 --> 48:47.040
I mean, that's fun.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.480
Don't get me wrong, it's super fun.

48:50.960 --> 48:53.360
You know what I would do if I was getting my mug shot taken?

48:54.400 --> 48:54.880
What?

48:54.880 --> 48:57.440
I would stand there and do exactly

48:58.800 --> 49:01.200
what the arresting officer told me to do,

49:01.200 --> 49:03.040
and I would be respectful

49:03.600 --> 49:07.040
and sort of acknowledge that I had done a crime

49:07.040 --> 49:09.600
and got caught at doing the crime.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.600
And so like I lost the game of law,

49:12.160 --> 49:16.240
and so I have to sort of deal with the consequences of it.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.480
I wouldn't act like an asshole

49:18.480 --> 49:20.400
and do some fun like goofy stuff.

49:20.400 --> 49:24.720
I would stand there and I would be very like compliant.

49:24.720 --> 49:27.200
And then you'd say, and now let's do a funny one.

49:28.160 --> 49:29.360
Yeah, or you know what I would do

49:29.360 --> 49:31.840
when I got my mug shot taken is not get arrested

49:31.840 --> 49:34.080
because I'm like a really good boy

49:34.080 --> 49:35.600
who doesn't do illegal things.

49:36.160 --> 49:40.800
So that's the real secret to a good mug shot

49:40.800 --> 49:43.200
is don't be in a position to have one taken at all.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.520
The best mug shot is the ones you don't take.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.000
That's true.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.360
You miss a hundred percent of the mug shots you don't take.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I work at a craft brewery in Vancouver

49:52.000 --> 49:53.120
because I'm a cool boy.

49:53.920 --> 49:56.560
We have a regular customer who stops by every few weeks.

49:56.560 --> 49:59.120
Each time he visits, he has a new first date.

49:59.120 --> 50:01.200
All dates look very similar.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.360
He either has a type or he's a murderer.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.000
They are all brunette and slightly taller than him.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.120
Here's the kicker.

50:07.120 --> 50:08.400
Every time he comes in,

50:08.400 --> 50:10.720
he pretends that he has never been to the brewery before

50:10.720 --> 50:11.760
and says things like,

50:11.760 --> 50:14.240
ooh, what's good and what should we get?

50:14.240 --> 50:16.400
I don't know much about this craft beer scene.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
I see this man more than I see my parents.

50:19.920 --> 50:24.880
Oh, man, this stinks.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.840
This stinks.

50:25.840 --> 50:28.800
My question is, do I confirm on his next date?

50:28.800 --> 50:30.640
Do I let the illusion continue?

50:30.640 --> 50:31.920
Additional info.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.600
Every time he gets a flight of beer

50:34.320 --> 50:38.320
and they've described here four or five ounce beers,

50:38.320 --> 50:40.960
they share it and he rarely gets another beer.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.160
They share it and he rarely gets another beer,

50:44.160 --> 50:45.680
only if the date is going super well.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.920
Also, not the best tipper.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.800
That's from slinging beers to,

50:50.800 --> 50:53.600
quote, strangers in Vancouver, Canada.

50:53.600 --> 50:54.800
I have an idea.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.760
Oh, man.

50:55.760 --> 50:56.560
Have you really?

50:56.560 --> 50:58.320
Let me say this, Travis.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.160
Have you really thought this through?

51:00.160 --> 51:00.880
Have you really?

51:00.880 --> 51:03.120
There was a lot to absorb.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.080
I have.

51:04.080 --> 51:04.880
Go with me here.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.480
I think you will both enjoy this.

51:06.480 --> 51:10.320
Travis, you have to Groundhog's Day this man.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.680
He's gonna come in and you're gonna go,

51:13.680 --> 51:14.560
Steven?

51:14.560 --> 51:15.200
No, man.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.960
He's gonna kind of like make big eyes

51:16.960 --> 51:17.920
and you're gonna say,

51:17.920 --> 51:20.240
I haven't seen you since high school

51:20.240 --> 51:22.800
and you are going to spout all these facts about him

51:22.800 --> 51:24.960
that you know from him coming in

51:24.960 --> 51:27.920
and that he knows you know from him coming in

51:27.920 --> 51:31.280
and see how long he can keep up the illusion

51:31.280 --> 51:33.920
that you're old buddies from your high school days

51:33.920 --> 51:35.120
in front of his date.

51:35.120 --> 51:37.200
Oh my God, that's actually kind of good.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.600
I mean, they won't do it.

51:39.600 --> 51:39.920
They won't.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.120
Because that's insane.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.600
But this is pretty good.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.280
They go on a bunch of first dates

51:45.280 --> 51:46.640
and it doesn't, you know,

51:46.640 --> 51:48.880
they're unlucky in love or whatever.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.000
Vancouver is a big city.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.720
You know, there's probably a big dating scene there.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.400
Big Tinder game up there.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.360
That's fine.

51:55.360 --> 51:55.920
Whatever.

51:56.720 --> 51:59.120
But that combined with the pretending

51:59.120 --> 52:00.240
you've never been to this place

52:00.240 --> 52:02.080
that you take all of your first dates to

52:02.080 --> 52:04.240
is, it's beyond.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.600
It's a whole nother level.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.400
Why would you do this?

52:06.400 --> 52:07.600
What's the advantage of doing this?

52:07.600 --> 52:09.680
If you're taking a first date somewhere,

52:09.680 --> 52:10.880
you want it to be like a place

52:10.880 --> 52:12.560
that you know is cool, right?

52:12.560 --> 52:13.920
This sounds like a hip cool place,

52:13.920 --> 52:15.200
hip cool craft brewery.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.640
So you want to take your first date there

52:16.640 --> 52:18.400
and be like, I know this cool craft brewery

52:18.400 --> 52:19.760
that I go to sometimes.

52:19.760 --> 52:20.960
Why the fuck would you pretend

52:20.960 --> 52:22.320
that you haven't been there before?

52:22.320 --> 52:23.520
Unless you're trying to like

52:24.800 --> 52:27.200
do a really, really unsavory zag.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.440
This is no bueno.

52:29.440 --> 52:32.160
I mean, I did one summer

52:32.160 --> 52:34.880
take like five or six different dates

52:34.880 --> 52:37.280
to go see Pirates of the Caribbean,

52:37.280 --> 52:37.920
the first one.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.800
And each time I can pretend

52:40.800 --> 52:42.400
like I haven't seen the movie yet.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.160
Well, I really love the movie, Griffin.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.680
And I wanted more excuses to go.

52:45.680 --> 52:46.800
Sorry, did you say you want to,

52:46.800 --> 52:48.480
you pretended like you hadn't seen it?

52:49.120 --> 52:50.720
Well, that would be weird if I was like,

52:50.720 --> 52:51.920
hey, date number three,

52:51.920 --> 52:53.200
do you want to go see this movie?

52:53.200 --> 52:54.640
I've already seen four times.

52:54.640 --> 52:55.280
So when fucking-

52:55.280 --> 52:56.800
Because she might say no.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.640
So fucking Barbosa stabs Jack

52:58.640 --> 53:00.240
at the end of it and you're like,

53:00.240 --> 53:01.440
oh, you have to pretend like,

53:01.440 --> 53:02.800
oh no, he's dead.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.840
But then he has that coin

53:03.840 --> 53:05.680
and you're like, I knew he wasn't dead.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.480
Before the movie starts,

53:08.480 --> 53:09.600
there's a lot of,

53:09.600 --> 53:10.880
boy, this is quite a character

53:10.880 --> 53:12.640
who is Johnny Depp is making.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.000
I don't know if he's going to be able to

53:14.000 --> 53:15.280
keep it together for a whole movie.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.080
And then at the end,

53:16.080 --> 53:16.800
you have to be like,

53:16.800 --> 53:18.560
wow, he really did pull it off.

53:18.560 --> 53:19.760
He really stuck the landing.

53:19.760 --> 53:20.560
And you know what?

53:20.560 --> 53:21.440
I love this movie.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.960
You have a moment that marked

53:22.960 --> 53:24.640
at like 90 minutes where you go,

53:24.640 --> 53:25.280
wait a minute.

53:26.080 --> 53:28.160
This reminds me of Keith Richards.

53:28.160 --> 53:31.760
Wait, is this based on a ride?

53:31.760 --> 53:33.200
And did you say that before?

53:33.200 --> 53:34.480
Like, I really love the ride.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.400
I hope there's a lot of references to it.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.520
Pirates?

53:38.720 --> 53:39.200
Novel.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.280
What is it?

53:41.280 --> 53:44.080
Some kind of adventures on the high seas?

53:44.080 --> 53:46.560
What are these ocean thieves?

53:48.720 --> 53:51.040
Are these like sky pirates who went on water?

53:51.040 --> 53:52.640
Who are these sea burglars?

53:53.280 --> 53:55.120
The one that's hardest to commit to

53:55.120 --> 53:56.560
is every time you see Karen Knightley

53:56.560 --> 53:57.120
you have to say,

53:57.120 --> 53:58.800
is that Robin Wright Penn?

53:58.800 --> 54:00.320
She looks fantastic.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.920
Hey, hey, does anybody know?

54:01.920 --> 54:03.040
Is that Robin Wright Penn?

54:04.160 --> 54:06.000
Oh, Legolas is in this one.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.960
I loved him in Elizabeth Town.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.520
Travis, that's also not,

54:13.520 --> 54:14.720
why did you do that?

54:14.720 --> 54:15.280
Why didn't you say-

54:15.280 --> 54:16.960
I was 18 and I just really loved

54:16.960 --> 54:18.480
Pirates of the Caribbean, Griffin.

54:18.480 --> 54:19.280
I'm not gonna sit here

54:19.280 --> 54:21.840
and make excuses to you, huh?

54:21.840 --> 54:22.880
Like you're perfect.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.360
I'm just saying you could just say like,

54:25.360 --> 54:26.720
let's go see Pirates of the Caribbean.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.400
I've already seen it and it's really great

54:28.400 --> 54:29.760
and I think you're gonna like it.

54:29.760 --> 54:31.680
I saw it nine times in theaters.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.640
At what point do I not have to like keep up?

54:34.640 --> 54:36.240
At what point are you forcibly removed

54:36.240 --> 54:37.840
from the podcast when we find a new host?

54:37.840 --> 54:38.640
Cause that's the-

54:38.640 --> 54:41.440
That's a good question that I'd love to answer right now.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.720
It was a very good movie.

54:42.720 --> 54:43.520
I was 18.

54:44.240 --> 54:46.160
There weren't a lot of good movies on that summer.

54:46.720 --> 54:47.680
Not a lot of good movies

54:47.680 --> 54:49.040
before Pirates of the Caribbean.

54:49.040 --> 54:49.520
Dang.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.560
Not that summer.

54:50.560 --> 54:52.720
No, it was just,

54:52.720 --> 54:54.400
I loved that movie a lot, you guys.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.320
And it's not like I stayed with it for the whole series.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.280
I didn't see the rest of them nine times in theaters.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.080
Just that one.

55:02.720 --> 55:04.080
Just Pirates of the Caribbean.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.880
And I would say only like six of that was like,

55:06.880 --> 55:09.600
I desperately want to see the other like three

55:09.600 --> 55:12.080
was like our family went once

55:12.080 --> 55:14.400
and then like friends wanted to go.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.480
I'm just saying I have very good reason

55:16.480 --> 55:18.320
for seeing Pirates of the Caribbean

55:18.320 --> 55:19.920
nine times in theaters, okay?

55:19.920 --> 55:21.440
Miserable piece of shit.

55:21.440 --> 55:24.880
Let's take it to the leaderboard, Mo.

55:24.880 --> 55:25.440
Let's see.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.000
Finding Nemo.

55:28.000 --> 55:28.720
Yes.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.400
Matrix Reloaded.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.440
Bruce Almighty.

55:32.000 --> 55:32.640
X2.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.160
Terminator 3.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.440
He's actually got a really good point.

55:35.440 --> 55:36.560
All these movies kind of blow,

55:36.560 --> 55:37.600
except for Finding Nemo.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.360
Bad Boys 2.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.240
Oh, that's a good one.

55:40.880 --> 55:41.440
Okay.

55:41.440 --> 55:43.040
Too Fast, Too Furious,

55:43.040 --> 55:44.480
you miserable piece of shit.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.760
The Italian Job.

55:47.760 --> 55:49.280
Mystic fucking River.

55:49.280 --> 55:52.320
Sea Biscuit.

55:52.320 --> 55:54.880
That's not a good date movie.

55:54.880 --> 55:55.920
That's like a date movie.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.960
Kangaroo fucking Jack.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.440
Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.720
Lot of sequels, huh?

56:04.720 --> 56:06.560
Lot of sequels that year.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.720
Lot of sequels and remakes, huh?

56:08.720 --> 56:10.400
Spy Kids 3D.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.480
June 20th from Justin 2 Kelly.

56:16.320 --> 56:17.520
Ang Lee's Hulk.

56:17.520 --> 56:18.880
Wow, what a bad summer.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.400
Holy shit, Travis.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.760
You were not kidding.

56:23.520 --> 56:24.000
Thank you.

56:24.640 --> 56:26.960
Is Parts of the Caribbean actually a good movie

56:26.960 --> 56:28.560
or did it just come out like-

56:29.120 --> 56:31.040
On the same day as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?

56:31.040 --> 56:32.160
Great question, Justin.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.520
Is it a good movie or did it just come out

56:35.520 --> 56:37.360
at the same time as Johnny English?

56:37.360 --> 56:38.800
A great question, Justin.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.120
Salient grain.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.400
Was it actually great?

56:42.400 --> 56:43.760
And did it come out two weeks before

56:43.760 --> 56:46.080
Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life?

56:46.080 --> 56:48.080
It's hard to say what is the truth here

56:48.080 --> 56:48.800
and what is fake.

56:52.560 --> 56:53.200
Oh, man.

56:54.320 --> 56:54.960
Tough to say.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.080
When contrasted from the bright light

56:58.080 --> 57:00.000
of The Secret Lives of Dentists,

57:01.440 --> 57:02.400
it's really tough.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.920
Okay, I get what you're saying.

57:05.920 --> 57:06.400
I get it.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.360
Folks, that's gonna do it for our podcast.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.720
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.160
You put this fucking person on blast

57:12.160 --> 57:13.280
the next time you come in.

57:13.280 --> 57:15.280
Jerry, you come in here every week.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.080
Stop it.

57:16.080 --> 57:16.640
Stop this.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.200
Stop it.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.560
Stop this behavior.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.560
Maybe he's like, oh,

57:20.560 --> 57:22.480
maybe he's one of like septuplets.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.680
That's no, no, Trav.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.160
Maybe he's got blank slate disease.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.320
Maybe he's got the clean slate, maybe.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.280
Uh, all right.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.040
Let's end the show.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.760
But call like a police officer

57:37.760 --> 57:38.640
or a private detective

57:38.640 --> 57:40.160
or like a bodyguard or drill bit

57:40.160 --> 57:41.360
tailor type figure

57:41.360 --> 57:42.480
in here to do this conversation.

57:42.480 --> 57:43.840
You are not gonna wanna do this confrontation.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.600
Get a drill bit tailored and do it for you.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.520
Also, summer of 2003, great flick.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.800
Drill bit tailor, thank you.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.960
Anyway, that's gonna do it for our podcast.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.160
My brother, my brother and me.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.760
Sorry, I, on a wild hair

57:53.760 --> 57:54.960
cause I was looking through my domains

57:54.960 --> 57:55.920
a little bit ago.

57:55.920 --> 57:57.600
I clicked through to which one vapes

57:57.600 --> 57:59.760
cause I was curious where the lead board was at.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.200
Not a lot of big surprises.

58:01.200 --> 58:02.960
Dane Cook, Johnny Depp, Jared Leto,

58:02.960 --> 58:04.640
Kid Rock, Russell Brand, Macklemore.

58:04.640 --> 58:05.520
They're top six.

58:06.640 --> 58:08.800
Highest rating woman, Miley Cyrus

58:08.800 --> 58:09.680
coming in at number eight.

58:09.680 --> 58:11.040
I was like, yeah, all right.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.720
Yeah, I really do like those.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.320
If you click through the leaderboards now

58:14.320 --> 58:16.720
at the bottom of the leaderboard,

58:16.720 --> 58:20.240
there's a new segment called Confirm Vapors.

58:20.240 --> 58:22.160
And it just says John Cusack

58:22.160 --> 58:23.440
and then underneath his name says,

58:23.440 --> 58:24.240
Cannot Hide.

58:24.240 --> 58:31.520
What a good website.

58:31.520 --> 58:32.640
It's like, there it is.

58:32.640 --> 58:33.520
This one's out.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.120
We can't vote on this one now.

58:35.120 --> 58:36.400
Yeah, all right.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.440
This one's out.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.400
So anyway, that's our show.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.360
My brother, my brother and me.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.840
We hope you have enjoyed it thoroughly

58:41.840 --> 58:42.960
and you had fun listening to it

58:42.960 --> 58:45.680
and I hope you're gonna have some good zags this week.

58:45.680 --> 58:46.880
Got some good ones planned.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.880
Don't sleep on this year.

58:48.880 --> 58:51.280
We've slept on every other year's motto.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.120
This one is too fun not to do.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.400
Zag on them.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.280
Zag on them.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.720
I would like to do a quick plug.

58:57.680 --> 59:00.960
A new show has just been added to the Max Fun Network,

59:00.960 --> 59:03.200
the network of which we are a part.

59:03.200 --> 59:06.240
And it is my favorite podcast in the world.

59:06.240 --> 59:09.200
It's hosted by a media luminary and his wife.

59:10.480 --> 59:12.640
And it's called Rose Buddies.

59:12.640 --> 59:15.520
And it stars, let me check my notes,

59:15.520 --> 59:17.440
Griffin McElroy and Rachel McElroy.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440
They talk about The Bachelor, The Bachelorette,

59:19.440 --> 59:23.120
Bachelor in Paradise and other like reality love shows.

59:23.840 --> 59:26.960
And it is no joke, my favorite podcast in the world.

59:26.960 --> 59:29.200
Even if you don't care about any of those properties

59:29.200 --> 59:31.680
and you might even be disgusted by them,

59:31.680 --> 59:33.360
I would say that the quality of the show

59:33.360 --> 59:36.000
and the fact that it is the funniest show around

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
kind of negates the need to actually watch

59:38.000 --> 59:40.080
the source material to enjoy the show.

59:40.080 --> 59:43.680
You should check it out, Rose Buddies on maximumfun.org

59:43.680 --> 59:45.280
and also on iTunes.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.480
Check it out, you're gonna love it.

59:46.480 --> 59:47.360
Thank you, Travie.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.400
That was very sweet of you.

59:49.040 --> 59:49.520
You're welcome.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.560
Be careful, it might actually lead to you

59:50.560 --> 59:51.840
watching The Bachelor though.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.040
Oh, and it's brain poison.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.080
That did happen to me.

59:54.080 --> 59:56.560
Yeah, there's lots of other great shows on the network

59:56.560 --> 59:59.440
though like Schmanners, which Travis does with his wife,

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.120
Teresa, that is so good.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.600
And Sawbones, which Justin does with Sydney,

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.880
that is also so good.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.480
And a bunch of other shows that we don't do

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.960
like Jordan and Jessie, go and stop podcasting yourself

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.040
and throwing shade in the flop house.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.880
Speaking of Jordan and Jessie, go.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.160
Oh, yeah.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.280
This weekend at Sketchfest, I am going to be doing

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.400
Jordan and Jessie, go at 1 p.m. on Saturday.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.560
Come see that, you can still get tickets for it.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.560
You know, just search Sketchfest Jordan and Jessie, go,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.120
I guess.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.160
And they also, they just celebrated their 10-year

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.520
anniversary of doing the show, which is bananas

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.840
and congratulations, Jordan and Jessie.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.800
That show was like super formative for us.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.840
Like we were big fans of that.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.720
And that's sort of how we got involved with the network.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.760
And so we wouldn't be here on MaxFun

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760
if it hadn't been for Jordan and Jessie, go.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.120
So it's a great show.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.240
Congratulations, guys.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240
And here's to 10 more.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.520
10 more good ones.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.680
Also on Saturday at Sketchfest at 4.30,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.400
I'm going to be doing Obsessed with Joseph Scrimshaw,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.040
talking about video games with Rebecca Watson.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So that is also happening this Saturday,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.640
Saturday the 14th at San Francisco Sketchfest.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.600
I'll see you there.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.200
I wanted to give a quick plug to a podcast

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.560
I haven't talked about in a long time,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.840
but it's continued to grow.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.760
It's not MaxFun Show, but it's called Quarter Pointed,

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.040
featuring my father-in-law, Tommy Smurl and Mike Meadows,

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.560
who I guess is my cousin.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.720
It's hard to, you know, it gets confusing.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.040
But Mike's a lawyer and they do a show

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.640
that educates you in law.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.160
I mainly wanted to highlight it this week

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.080
because all of their episode titles

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.760
are always something vs. something else,

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.960
and they're always a delight.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.360
But this week's episode is called Rasputin vs. JonBenet,

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.600
and you really can't beat that for an episode title.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.320
Yeah, it's-

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.280
Probably ever.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.080
I am gripped.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.640
Yeah, I mean, you're on the edge of your seat.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:54.960
Sure.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.200
And it's the beginning of season two of Quarter Pointed,

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.080
which is a good idea.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.200
We should have done seasons.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:01:59.600
Damn it.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.480
But anyway, Quarter Pointed is the name of the podcast.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.920
And thanks to John Rodger and the Long Winters

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.200
for the use of our theme song instead of departure

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.480
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.720
You've got it at this point, I'm sure.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.840
But if not, pick it up and tell your friends to pick it up.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.160
And it's really, really a fantastic album,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.280
and I think you're gonna like it a lot.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.480
Should we tie one off?

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:20.880
Is that anything?

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:21.840
No.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.040
I don't know.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.040
I think it's something.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.800
I'd like to read the last question.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.160
It was sent in by Nicholas Potter.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.720
Thank you, Nicholas.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.360
This is by Yahoo Answers user Sharon S, who asks,

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.280
when is the best time to have a root beer float?

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.200
My name's Justin McElroy.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.240
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.040
I'm mediailluminary3030, your girl from McElroy.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.200
He's been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:03:02.320
Cause your dad's square on the lips.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.600
Hi, this is Griffin McElroy.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.640
Hi, this is Rachel McElroy.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.760
And we're the host of Rose Buddies.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.400
It's a podcast about the Bachelor family of products.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.080
We watch The Bachelor, The Bachelorette,

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.280
and Bachelor in Paradise.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.760
Yes, it is garbage television, but we're the king and queen

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.720
of this garbage pile, we're the raccoons in charge around here.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.240
So join us on Tuesdays.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.000
Because the TV show's on Mondays.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.680
And basically we'll recap what we saw,

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.000
and we'll just sort of scoop the garbage around us

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.760
and make a little fort out of it.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.200
No viewing required.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.280
But it's a good TV show.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.080
What are you doing?

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.040
