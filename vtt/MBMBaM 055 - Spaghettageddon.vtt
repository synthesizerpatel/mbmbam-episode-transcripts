WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.160
Live from the spot, rough and raw, at our daddy's house. We're at our daddy's house.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.720
Let me check the date. I just opened up the calendar. It's pasta party 2011.

00:55.440 --> 00:58.800
Welcome to our daddy's house. We're live from our daddy's couch.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.280
Let me check this. Let me check the spaghettometer,

01:01.280 --> 01:03.680
because it looks like we're going full blown pasta.

01:03.680 --> 01:08.400
Spaghettiton. Spaghettagettin' 2011.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.360
As you well know, as you've probably guessed, we had a- we carbo-loaded pre-show

01:14.480 --> 01:19.440
here in Ironton. Our stepmom Carol fed us a bunch of spaghetti.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.480
We're fucking primed for calling it spaghetti.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.040
She looked down at us and said, you're not fucking funny enough,

01:27.040 --> 01:30.240
eat some more spaghetti. She shoved spaghett-

01:30.240 --> 01:33.120
fistful after fistful of sweet spaghett into my mouth.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.800
I am ready to blow. Noodle up, you unfunny fucks.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.560
It's time to get spaghett. You got spaghett.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.960
Spaghett, you fucker. You got spaghettin'.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.080
For real though, rough and raw, I know people have become accustomed

01:50.080 --> 01:53.120
to a certain level of editing juice applied to this show.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.440
This is not going to be one of those apps that's going to be rough, raw.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.120
Just cut it, set it, forget it.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.320
We are gathered around one mic. The last time we did this,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.720
two of us were jet lagged. And I was drunk.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.680
And Travis was drunk. So it's not going to be like this.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.880
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.800
I am your most excellent eldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.120
And I am the middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.440
And I'm Griffin. And I'm a child.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.160
This is an advice show. We take your questions and turn them into advice.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.800
I am drinking a red stripe,

02:24.800 --> 02:26.800
since this show is coming to you straight from the islands.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.480
I've got a red stripe going, and an amber brown.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.200
No, honey brown. Excuse me, pardon me.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.480
Travis got a beer before we started, and then said,

02:36.480 --> 02:40.320
I'm going to need a beer. He had a beer. He has a backup beer waiting.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.840
So just so you guys know, if I need an extra burst of energy, you'll hear quiet.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.520
And you'll know, because we'll draw attention to it.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.400
Our first question.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.040
At some point, also, our daddy's going to come in the room and take pictures of us.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.800
No joke. And it's going to be super distraught.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.960
It's going to throw us off whatever dope rhythm we're on.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.440
So get ready for that moment.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.480
I hope he's not at the...

02:58.480 --> 03:01.040
If he is, if he comes through that door in the single tier,

03:01.040 --> 03:02.880
because he just heard you said that, I'm never forgiving you.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.040
I am getting married this summer,

03:05.040 --> 03:08.080
and one of my groomsmen is getting married a few months after me.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.720
He is having a very small destination wedding,

03:10.720 --> 03:14.400
and has decided to specifically not give his friends plus ones,

03:14.400 --> 03:15.440
even if they are married.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.240
My soon-to-be wife is understandably upset about this.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.520
Some people think she talked...

03:20.080 --> 03:23.680
Oh, some people she talked to think that I should decline

03:23.680 --> 03:26.000
to go to the wedding because she wasn't invited.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.200
Ideally, I would like my fiancé to be invited,

03:29.200 --> 03:32.880
but I also understand my friend's choice to not invite any plus ones,

03:33.760 --> 03:35.840
given how small the wedding will be.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.960
How can I support my good friend and my fiancé at the same time,

03:40.960 --> 03:44.000
as from Tristan, not the marine?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.920
Not the marine.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.680
Tristan, Tristan, civilian Tristan.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.200
Civilian Tristan, Civvy Trist.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.760
Wow, that is...

03:55.040 --> 03:57.200
Susan, you didn't want to go to Cabo anyway, right?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.240
You were just talking the other week

03:58.240 --> 03:59.840
about how much you hate destination weddings.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.800
Don't take this personally,

04:00.800 --> 04:03.520
but Derek specifically does not want you there.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.400
It's a destination...

04:04.400 --> 04:06.160
The destination is Des Moines.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.120
It's not gonna be a big deal.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.040
Man, that's brutal.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.760
What a great way to start off your wedded life,

04:11.760 --> 04:13.360
just pissing off everybody.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.160
Yeah.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.480
I honestly think that straight up...

04:19.760 --> 04:20.480
You can't go.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.280
I wouldn't go.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.640
I mean, honestly, if they...

04:24.160 --> 04:25.600
The thing about a wedding is,

04:26.800 --> 04:30.160
as much as it is for you guys,

04:30.160 --> 04:33.840
it's just as much, if not more so,

04:33.840 --> 04:35.920
for the people that are sort of gathered there.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.440
I know it's their special day and what all,

04:37.440 --> 04:41.440
but I think that it is a slight.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.480
I mean, it's like a...

04:42.480 --> 04:43.760
It's especially...

04:43.760 --> 04:45.520
It's like, because it's your friend

04:45.520 --> 04:48.720
who's in your wedding saying,

04:48.720 --> 04:50.480
whether he has thought about it or not,

04:50.480 --> 04:52.320
saying, hey, I know you just got married

04:52.320 --> 04:55.120
and are happily wedded for all of three months,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.120
but you're gonna need to leave her behind.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.280
Like that's a dick move.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.280
Yeah, especially he's getting married

05:01.280 --> 05:03.600
a few months after the question asked her.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.840
So she's gonna be your wife when that happens.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.120
You can't leave your wife behind,

05:07.120 --> 05:11.120
especially, especially not if you're going someplace nice.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.480
Like really, that is not the way to kick off your...

05:14.480 --> 05:17.280
Destination weddings are the most whorish thing

05:17.280 --> 05:18.240
you can do, right?

05:18.240 --> 05:19.280
It's terrible already.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.280
The only way it flies to me is if you invite no one.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.520
If it's just like we were creepy sneaky

05:25.520 --> 05:27.120
and we bolted out of there,

05:27.120 --> 05:29.440
please come and give us presents in a big room.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.600
What about webcast wedding?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.720
Web casting.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.400
Who's invited? Everyone.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.240
Because everyone's got an internet connection nowadays.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.600
You got Ustream on that phone?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.320
You're invited?

05:38.320 --> 05:42.240
Justin TV my wedding, please.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.480
I'm happy to TV anyone's wedding, by the way.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.920
It's for a very reasonable fee.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.240
Thank you.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Honestly, Tristan, you are going to learn very soon

05:52.000 --> 05:55.680
that choosing the side of your wife

05:56.320 --> 06:00.640
is almost never not the right thing to do.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.000
I'm not sure how my negatives are.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.600
How fucked up is your friend that he's like,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.080
I want you to come, but not your other half.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.040
Not your better half.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.320
And I say that kudos to you for realizing how big an influence-

06:10.320 --> 06:12.960
God, you are ahead of the fucking game, bro.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.760
Good job.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.400
I'm proud of you.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.200
See you, honey.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.720
A worser man would have been like,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.840
hey, did I remember to pack my trunks and my goggles,

06:19.840 --> 06:20.880
but not my wife?

06:20.880 --> 06:21.840
Okay, cool, I'm out.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.680
Got the banana boat.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.320
Don't have Barbara.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.840
Don't got my SO, but-

06:27.840 --> 06:28.480
Sorry.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.120
Sorry, Tristan.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.560
I know that's awkward.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.320
But honestly, that's the kind of awkward

06:32.320 --> 06:33.120
you can feel good about,

06:33.120 --> 06:34.000
especially if you're going to be married.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.720
You got to get used to-

06:35.520 --> 06:36.800
You guys are a team now.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.400
It's a package deal,

06:38.400 --> 06:40.560
especially if you're going to be legally married.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.520
It's not like she's your girlfriend.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.960
It's a package deal.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.560
It might be worth it to talk to your groomsman

06:46.560 --> 06:48.880
and be like, hey, I'm bringing her.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.560
And if he's like, well, it's a small wedding,

06:50.560 --> 06:52.160
then say, okay, then I can't come.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.920
Yeah, put that shit back on him.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.120
Put that ball right back in his court.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.640
Yeah, this is his decision to make.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.920
It's you two or nothing.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.200
On Mother's Day, I took my mom to an ice cafe in NYC for lunch.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.680
After we finished eating, she needed to use the restroom.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.960
However, there was a woman ahead of her on the line,

07:08.960 --> 07:10.720
and both of them had to wait for a long time

07:10.720 --> 07:12.160
for the occupant to finish,

07:12.160 --> 07:14.480
even though the men's room remained unoccupied.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.400
I told her she should just have used the men's room.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.920
It was as clean as the women's.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.600
The only difference between the two bathrooms

07:19.600 --> 07:20.880
was the sign on the door.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.320
They were both single toilet rooms,

07:22.320 --> 07:25.040
so there was no danger of running into someone

07:25.600 --> 07:27.120
of the opposite sex in the bathroom.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.160
It's also fairly common for women to use the men's room

07:30.160 --> 07:31.360
at an overcrowded bar.

07:31.360 --> 07:31.680
Is it?

07:31.680 --> 07:35.280
What is someone supposed to do in a situation like this?

07:36.160 --> 07:40.400
Is the inverse true for men using the women's restroom?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.600
It's from Jordan.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.720
God, no.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.120
No.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.320
No to everything.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.280
No to all of that?

07:45.280 --> 07:46.160
No to everything.

07:46.160 --> 07:46.640
I've...

07:47.200 --> 07:48.160
Here's what's up.

07:48.160 --> 07:48.640
Okay.

07:48.640 --> 07:54.080
When you are a gentleman or a lady living and surviving

07:54.080 --> 07:57.040
and just barely getting by on the skin of your teeth

07:57.040 --> 08:00.000
and your charm alone with irritable bowel syndrome,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.680
like when you see a wrong gender person in your right bathroom,

08:05.680 --> 08:07.280
you get so fucking angry.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.880
You get so angry because it's like...

08:09.840 --> 08:11.680
For me, it's always an emergency.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.960
So it's like I have to go right now, but I can't go.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.000
There has to...

08:16.000 --> 08:16.800
There better be a good...

08:16.800 --> 08:19.200
There better be a goddamn great explanation for this.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.960
I'm gonna counterpoint by saying I love using the ladies room.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.440
And I was...

08:23.440 --> 08:24.480
It's painted better.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.440
It's cleaner.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.520
It's weird how they have lounges sometimes.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.560
Yeah, it's nice.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.520
Better hand soap.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.160
Are you being serious?

08:30.160 --> 08:30.800
Yeah.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.520
Yeah, sure, sure.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.600
Is there a legal law that says you can't do that?

08:35.600 --> 08:36.400
A legal law?

08:36.400 --> 08:36.640
No.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.760
Did someone take a bill to Congress and pass it with the president

08:41.760 --> 08:43.120
that said you can't do that?

08:43.120 --> 08:43.360
No.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.000
It's just signs.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.360
If you're in there with the intention of being a sneaky, creepy peeper,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.120
I think that is illegal.

08:51.120 --> 08:56.240
I call when I get rid of waste in the bathroom, I call it peeping.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.280
So you'll have to be much more specific.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.880
I'm always creepy about it.

09:00.880 --> 09:01.760
What is the problem?

09:01.760 --> 09:02.640
They're just holes.

09:03.200 --> 09:03.680
What, your butt?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.040
Your butt hole in people?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.720
No, I mean, you're just...

09:06.720 --> 09:08.000
Oh, like a lady's vagina?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.040
No, like the holes that you leave the bad things in.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.880
Like, they're just holes.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.400
Like, what does it matter?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.360
The turlet holes.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.320
Why are you so adherent to society's rules is what I'm saying.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.040
Because my...

09:19.040 --> 09:21.520
Have you seen a little show called Ally McBeal?

09:21.520 --> 09:21.760
Yeah.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.440
Unisex bathrooms, my friend.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.080
Sure, sure, sure.

09:24.080 --> 09:24.960
Way for the future.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.520
Ooga chaka.

09:25.520 --> 09:25.840
I dig it.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.400
But listen.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.840
I'm just getting old.

09:27.840 --> 09:28.480
Listen, listen, listen.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.520
I'm really vain.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.480
My worst fear, 100% of the time, even when I'm not peeping,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.280
my worst fear is that someone's gonna walk in on me on the bathroom.

09:37.280 --> 09:41.520
If I'm in the men's room and somebody walks in and sees my bits and everything

09:42.160 --> 09:44.480
and like a full-grown poop coming out of me, like,

09:45.600 --> 09:48.160
if a dude sees that, I am haunted.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.400
I am aghast.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.240
If a lady sees it, I will commit sex poop on the SPOT.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.840
I'll tell you right now, the biggest fear is when I'm using the bathroom

09:57.840 --> 10:00.720
in the ladies room and the handle jiggles.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.040
Oh, yeah.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.080
Like, they were trying...

10:02.080 --> 10:06.480
Then you're trapped in this situation where you're like, oh no.

10:06.480 --> 10:06.880
Yeah.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.760
They're like, are you done?

10:07.760 --> 10:08.800
And you're like, I am now.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.040
I have the weight of the world on my shoulders now.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.600
And then you gotta do a Mrs. Doubtfire style, like,

10:15.600 --> 10:18.480
put the keg on your face and sneak out before they realize you're a dude.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.760
I wanted to point something out real quick about bathrooms that made me laugh today.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.920
Actually, yesterday it occurred to me.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.840
I was at the movie theaters in the bathroom.

10:28.560 --> 10:33.920
And for me, it does not get better than when two guys are in a bathroom

10:33.920 --> 10:36.240
and one guy just toots like it's nothing.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.480
Like, all of society's rules have, like, crumbled around him.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.600
And there's nothing more hysterical than a guy dropping it.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.400
Like, what?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.120
What's up?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.000
Check it.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.400
Check.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.120
Check that out.

10:47.120 --> 10:47.840
Check what I just did for you.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.040
What are you gonna say now?

10:49.040 --> 10:49.680
What's up?

10:49.680 --> 10:50.960
Whose rule is roost?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.000
You guys want a yahoo?

10:52.000 --> 10:52.720
Yeah, give it to me.

10:52.720 --> 10:56.720
Uh, this spaghetti-fueled yahoo is brought to you by Nick Jensen.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.600
Thank you, Nick Jensen.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.400
And ragu.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.200
Thank you, ragu.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Darcy B who says,

11:03.920 --> 11:08.480
should I try out for my sweet 16 or 16 and pregnant?

11:10.000 --> 11:10.800
Really think about it.

11:10.800 --> 11:15.280
I really want my 15-minute fame, so I am going to try and get on MTV.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.000
I was thinking maybe my parents could throw a big party for me

11:18.000 --> 11:19.920
and I could appear on my sweet 16.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.720
Although, if I sign up for 16 and pregnant, I could also go on Teen Mom afterwards.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.960
This would give me more chance in the public eye.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.400
Uh-huh.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.320
So she's saying, should my parents throw me a big party or should I get knocked out?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.560
Should I get pregnant and then get double fame?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.920
Well, no, this is ridiculous.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.960
This is so stupid.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.280
Have the super sweet 16.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.000
Announce during super sweet 16, by the way.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.120
I'm gonna get knocked up.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.240
I'm fucking on it.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.120
No, make the super sweet 16 about knocking her out.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.880
Like, the knocking up theme party.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.240
So it's a super-duper sweet 16.

11:50.240 --> 11:50.800
Yeah.

11:50.800 --> 11:57.680
I think that in this high-pressure society, you have to try to get on as many TV shows as possible.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.480
Absolutely.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.120
So you're saying, could we do something?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.160
Could we do, what's that?

12:02.160 --> 12:04.960
You could do super sweet 16 and 16 and pregnant,

12:04.960 --> 12:08.720
and also maybe you have a really challenging cake you need baked for your party.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.080
And then you have to get on Cakebox.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.440
What's the one where they make the real-ass little baby girls look like creepy-ass porcelain dolls?

12:15.440 --> 12:16.560
That's not on MTV.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.880
That's not on MTV.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.160
We're talking single channel.

12:20.160 --> 12:20.720
Single channel.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.600
Here's what I'm suggesting.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.160
X Factor.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.600
True life, I'm a man in a woman's body.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.240
Okay.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.760
Then you switch it and you're-

12:27.760 --> 12:28.320
No, no, no.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.920
True life, I'm a woman in a man's body.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.280
And then you do made.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.000
At that point, you are an unofficial MTV VJ.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.240
Right.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.080
You're like the Jesse.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.440
You're basically Sway at that point.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.800
You're basically Sway.

12:38.800 --> 12:44.080
And then what you want to do is get on super sweet 16 during the party, get knocked up.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.480
Uh-huh. You're saying like chain it.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.720
So like an entire like nine-year career.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.000
A c-c-c-combo.

12:51.440 --> 12:56.160
But I have to be honest, I'm not sure the human frame can withstand.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.320
Can your frame handle the fame is my question.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.440
Are you famous enough?

13:01.440 --> 13:04.240
Actually, that is the plot to Real Housewives of New Jersey.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.760
So they got that trademark.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.120
Poor Sway.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.080
He's doing his best.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.920
His parents named him Sway.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.120
What do you want from him?

13:11.120 --> 13:15.120
A couple of weeks ago, one of my friends invited me to his bachelor party in Vegas.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.880
However, about a week before we were supposed to leave,

13:18.880 --> 13:21.440
he calls me and says that a couple of guys couldn't make it.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.160
So they were going to reschedule it sometime during the summer.

13:24.160 --> 13:28.720
On the day we're supposed to go to Vegas, I got a text from him that was meant for his fiancee

13:28.720 --> 13:31.680
saying that they had got to the rooms in Vegas.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.040
They're heading out to the casinos.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.520
Should I confront him about this?

13:35.520 --> 13:38.000
Do I even go to the wedding after I got royally dicked over?

13:38.720 --> 13:39.440
Thanks, brothers.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.320
That's from Sulking in San Diego.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.800
So they gave this guy the fucking San Diego slip.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
Became the San Diego slip, yes.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.520
And then he doesn't, he doesn't.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.880
What was the guy's fob after that?

13:50.880 --> 13:52.880
Like, oh, I guess I canceled my bachelor party.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.160
We're not having it anymore.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.440
Now you don't get to come.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.120
Well, what I love is I love that.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.360
I love his optimism that he thinks his friend accidentally sent him that text.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.520
Or is he maybe like, hey, surprise.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.960
We're in our hotel rooms.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.080
Hey, can you get to Vegas?

14:06.080 --> 14:08.000
Like, dog, we live in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.920
I absolutely can't get down to Vegas.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.880
No, we can't do that.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.200
What's up with this show being the theme of dick friends?

14:15.200 --> 14:18.960
Like, hey, of all the, hey, hey, hey, bachelor.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.800
Hey, hey, hey, potential groom.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.880
You fucked that text up the worst you could possibly do it.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.720
We're also having a great time and so glad Bobby's not here.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.400
Hey, honey, I'm getting, I'm getting my dick wet.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.680
Oops, Bobby.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.640
No, no.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.960
No, you, why did I marry a girl named Bobby?

14:39.600 --> 14:40.960
My good friend name.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.840
So what do you think that?

14:41.840 --> 14:46.560
So sulky in San Diego is just sort of the, he's like the uncool one in the group and

14:46.560 --> 14:50.400
the group wanted to leave him behind or got a bad rap and like a bum rap.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.240
You got a bum rap and I don't know.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.120
I don't know what to tell you.

14:53.120 --> 14:53.680
He's not.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.840
I do one word rampage.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.320
Okay.

14:56.320 --> 14:56.800
Oh shit.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.360
I like it.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.160
Tell me more.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.280
You're going to Vegas.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.320
You're flipping tables.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.560
I'm saying roll up to Vegas.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.160
Sunglasses on cigarette.

15:04.160 --> 15:04.720
That lit.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.760
Gun loaded.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.960
Chilling with rampage.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.040
Chilling with Rampage Jackson, the fighter.

15:09.040 --> 15:09.280
Yeah.

15:09.280 --> 15:09.840
Yeah.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.960
Befriend all the pit bosses you can find and like say that guy over there.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.600
Ocean's Eleven style, like huge con.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.920
Try to steal his wedding.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.280
Steal your dignity back.

15:19.280 --> 15:19.680
No.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.640
Steal the wedding.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.360
Steal the wedding.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.400
Now it's your wedding.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.840
Are those carnations?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.960
Gotta get them, Danny.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.000
Oh, I like this sulking.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.480
You are going to have to go A, full Ocean's Eleven, steal the wedding, hijack, heist,

15:33.040 --> 15:33.520
loving it.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.960
I got tiny Korean man.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.360
He jumped through the window of the church, got the whole cake.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.080
Is that in one joke?

15:40.080 --> 15:40.960
Is that a priest?

15:40.960 --> 15:41.440
Nope.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.400
It's Scott Conn.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.320
Casey Affleck is there.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.520
We're not 100% sure in one capacity.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.520
Scott Conn is actually a legal minister though.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.240
Minister in the Presbyterian church.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.120
A lot of people don't know that.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.200
You guys want another Yahoo?

15:59.200 --> 15:59.760
Yes, please.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.320
Yes, please.

16:00.320 --> 16:04.160
Uh, oh, God, I should have looked at these ahead of time.

16:04.960 --> 16:05.600
How about this?

16:07.040 --> 16:08.640
So I sent it by Jacob Locker.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mark.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.920
Thank you, Jacob Locker, for giving us this.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.480
Mark asks, why is this woman farting on my wife at the gym?

16:19.680 --> 16:23.120
Every time my wife and I go to the gym, a lady probably in her mid 40s decides to go

16:23.120 --> 16:25.280
near her and fart the first few times.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.400
My wife would give me a funny look and we would later laugh about it.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.480
We'll get back to that.

16:30.480 --> 16:35.440
But by the seventh or eighth time, my wife has become considerably annoyed.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.200
She even said to the woman, excuse you.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.560
And the woman completely ignored her, farted again, and then walked away.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.120
Should we complain to the gym's management or could this lady have a problem?

16:45.120 --> 16:49.840
It's strange that she only farts on my wife and no one else at the gym.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.800
Have you checked around?

16:51.360 --> 16:52.240
Did you ask?

16:52.240 --> 16:53.280
What is you?

16:53.840 --> 16:55.680
It qualifies as a fetish.

16:55.680 --> 17:01.200
If after seven to eight times, all you're doing is saying, excuse you, that is not a

17:01.200 --> 17:06.800
passive aggression is maybe the first time it happens or the half the half time it happens

17:06.800 --> 17:07.920
because it's unacceptable.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.240
And then they get punched right in the butt.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.680
By seven or eight, we're at like restraining order and or butt punches.

17:16.640 --> 17:16.880
Yeah.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.680
By the second time, you should ask if you can pull down the front of their tank top

17:21.680 --> 17:22.400
and puke down it.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.920
Because I would like to know, can we rewind back to you?

17:25.920 --> 17:31.040
I would like to know the look that has exchanged and I think this lady just farted on me.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.800
Okay, that's that's that's the sticking point because stinking point.

17:35.680 --> 17:41.920
A human being just expelled gas on your wife, on your betrothed.

17:42.560 --> 17:47.760
And what you did was she looked at you like, no, like, okay, did you get?

17:47.760 --> 17:49.360
This is going to be a fun story later.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.960
Like, no, it isn't.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.840
You got farted on.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.440
That's gross and disrespectful.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.040
I can't even look at you anymore.

17:55.040 --> 17:55.280
Yeah.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.760
How am I supposed to make love to you?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.200
By the way, I want a divorce.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.040
I need a divorce.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.560
Thank you so much, exercise Debbie.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.200
You're a bitch.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.120
This question was asked two days ago.

18:11.120 --> 18:15.920
How many more times is this woman going to continue to terrorize this couple?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.120
It is one woman, right?

18:17.120 --> 18:18.000
It's just one.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.400
Is it like just one woman or is this one serial?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.080
Dude is a Jack the Ripper.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.520
She's got she's got some sort of crazy obsession.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.600
Like fucking one hour photo with this white.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.880
Instead of like jerking off the pictures of their family's photo,

18:34.880 --> 18:36.960
she's farting on only the wife at the gym.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.400
Cut it out, everybody.

18:38.400 --> 18:38.960
Cut it out.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.520
You just ruin the fun.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.960
Yeah, at least go.

18:42.960 --> 18:48.960
I want that Robin Williams fart on me all day long, which is I think pretty much what

18:48.960 --> 18:50.160
he did during license to wed.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.960
Is it is there a possible that this middle aged woman is Robin Williams in a way?

18:58.640 --> 18:59.760
It's really good.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.440
My favorite part of the email is she says, excuse you.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.800
In a manner, it says, please leave.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.400
And the woman's response is she farts once more and then tips.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.120
Excuse me.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.000
No, fuck you.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.280
No, no, no, no.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.440
She's a drive by tutor.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.800
I think that's a down fire deep cut.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.840
What's everyone's favorite line from what you say?

19:28.240 --> 19:28.880
Bring them out.

19:28.880 --> 19:29.920
Oh, fuck.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.640
Oh, Jesus.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.160
I like when you get your junior career to start to like slide right down that hill.

19:39.120 --> 19:44.240
Griffin, let's we've been sitting on this couch and it's honestly it's made me a little

19:44.240 --> 19:47.520
stir the pasta is actually settled heavy in my gut.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.080
Yeah, it's made me a little stir crazy.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.680
And it made me want to take a little journey with my two brothers.

19:53.680 --> 20:14.560
Do you know where I don't know where we've already joined so much today.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.880
So we've got a very happy birthday message to one.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.600
Sherilyn is from her children, Eloise and Jordan, I hope they don't listen.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.680
Well, they are four and two.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.960
So they do listen.

20:28.000 --> 20:28.320
Wow.

20:28.320 --> 20:32.000
They either don't understand or they understand so deeply.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.880
First of all, these kids have no idea who Robin Williams is.

20:35.840 --> 20:41.360
We should actually have a you know, how how deaf people have an interpreter there.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.440
We need something like that for kids like Robin Williams.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.760
He's like he's like he's like Barney.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.720
We get Robin Williams to interpret for himself.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.520
This is how I relate to I'm like the he's the genie in Aladdin.

20:52.320 --> 20:52.800
Well, there's that.

20:52.800 --> 20:57.120
But I mean, even that might watch Aladdin, you know, the man you see on TV sometimes

20:57.120 --> 20:59.840
and he looks like he's on his like third or fourth heart.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.280
And also his hands are carpeted just related to death.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.240
The synergy.

21:04.240 --> 21:04.720
Yeah.

21:04.720 --> 21:04.960
Okay.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.160
So this from Sherilyn.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.720
The message is from Jordan Eloise.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.680
These kids are super fucking smart.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.760
They're really they're emailing.

21:18.640 --> 21:25.120
She is an editor of scientific documents, particularly for French scientists, which

21:25.120 --> 21:28.080
means she's probably smarter than the whole couch.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.280
Or a secret agent.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.520
That sounds like a job that someone comes up with and like, oh, she edits science documents

21:33.520 --> 21:38.000
for doesn't seem like that's every every role that Nicole Kidman has ever played in a movie.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.560
I'm a science editor for French Sciences.

21:40.560 --> 21:46.640
I'm not okay with you taking French science and giving it the old American spit shine.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.360
Yeah, I would prefer that we keep our science here in our borders safe and sound.

21:51.360 --> 21:51.600
Right.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.960
We had to develop our science.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.480
We had to develop it and you're just giving it away for free for France or whatever your

21:56.480 --> 21:56.960
salary is.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.720
What I'm saying is I'll pay your salary.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.280
Stop it.

21:59.280 --> 21:59.760
Stop it.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.400
Stop doing it.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.520
I'll put your kids through college.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.880
So the little kids aren't listeners yet.

22:04.880 --> 22:08.160
We hope that when they get to be older, they will be listeners.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.720
And Sherilyn, of course, Sherilyn Woltrop, happy birthday to you.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.560
We hope you have a great one.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.360
Shit, because this just changed from a birthday message to a time capsule.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.480
Oh, yeah.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.280
Hey, kids.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.360
I hope you're at least 16.

22:21.360 --> 22:21.920
16.

22:21.920 --> 22:22.960
So 12 years from now.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.360
A good or a mature 14.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.320
Oh, here comes daddy.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.200
Very discreet.

22:29.200 --> 22:29.840
Hold on.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.480
Every smile.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.520
It's a time capsule.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.360
It's a time capsule for your kids.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.880
And we're making a time capsule right now.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.560
Oh, but my hair looks terrible.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.520
Not a father.

22:37.520 --> 22:44.880
So our other our other journey that we're taking to the money zone is our buddy James

22:44.880 --> 22:46.880
Gowdy, who is who is I don't know if you see him.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.240
He's active on the Twitter, active on the Twitter, constantly promoting the show and

22:50.240 --> 22:50.960
on the beat.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.880
He's on the beat because he's a police officer for the London Metropolitan Police, the Met

22:54.880 --> 22:55.440
Police.

22:55.440 --> 23:00.320
And he is going to be in B&B AM's resident policeman.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.520
So he's British, right?

23:01.520 --> 23:01.840
Yeah.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.400
He's a Brit.

23:02.400 --> 23:02.880
Brit.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.080
They don't get guns, right?

23:06.080 --> 23:07.200
They have all guns.

23:07.200 --> 23:07.600
They are.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.560
Their arms are guns.

23:10.160 --> 23:10.320
Yeah.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.960
They make them surgically replace their arms with guns and not like the chintzy.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.720
Like, look at the gun gun.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.480
You're saying, I mean, right.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.680
He fires a pint of Guinness right into someone's face.

23:23.680 --> 23:28.000
You can find him Gowdy James on Twitter if you if you'd like to follow him.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.120
Everyone crush him.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.800
Just crush him with followers.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.400
And oh, he says I should throw in my English accent, too.

23:34.400 --> 23:40.080
So here's what I think it sounds like when a British person is a cop, is a cop.

23:40.080 --> 23:40.320
Hold on.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.680
Wait, why don't I just play the song, the jingle, and you can sing British cop lyrics

23:43.680 --> 23:44.240
over it.

23:44.240 --> 24:01.360
You son of a bitch.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.920
He's Gowdy, but she's not Gowdy.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.960
She's a French scientist editor.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.400
He's a cop on the beat.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.400
She joins him on the street.

24:12.400 --> 24:16.480
Unconventional partners work in the beat.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.880
It's Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.480
Hey, there's a crime.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.520
Can you make it rhyme with tree?

24:30.320 --> 24:32.240
That's the only French word I know.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.560
Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.240
Canceled after three episodes.

24:43.520 --> 24:47.760
Rabid fan base conventions.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.400
Yeah, they got them for Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.840
Hey, Eloise.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.880
Hey, other kids.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.280
Sorry I scrolled away from your name.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.520
Happy birthday.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.640
Happy 14th and 16th birthday.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.360
Asynchronous twins.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.240
French science.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.200
British crime.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.760
Gowdy and not Gowdy.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.280
Yeah, she's never party.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.000
Governor.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.400
Lovener.

25:26.960 --> 25:27.920
I should say so.

25:27.920 --> 25:33.840
Gowdy and not Dowdy Sherilyn.

25:36.160 --> 25:36.800
There we go.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.680
That's the Money Zone.

25:39.360 --> 25:39.920
I love it.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.040
Yeah, I love it too.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.080
I looked away for a second.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.080
I was like, whoa, is that Liam Gallagher?

25:44.080 --> 25:46.160
Yeah, is it Liam Gallagher?

25:46.160 --> 25:46.560
Is he here?

25:47.200 --> 25:49.440
So that was our journey in the Money Zone.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.240
They're brothers too.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.040
They're brothers too.

25:51.040 --> 25:51.600
Did you know that?

25:51.600 --> 25:52.400
The strokes?

25:52.400 --> 25:55.680
If you're interested in joining us for a trip to the Money Zone,

25:55.680 --> 25:59.120
you can contact Teresa at maximumfun.org.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.400
That is Teresa with an H.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.960
I'm a lesbian and I...

26:03.520 --> 26:04.800
Okay, that was British.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.040
Okay.

26:06.560 --> 26:13.840
I'm a lesbian and I recently cut my hair.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.520
But now I'm having second thoughts.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.440
Before it was all the way down to my waist.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.360
Now it's more a men's style cut.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.880
Although still long enough to show my loverly curls.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.400
I think it looks cute.

26:24.400 --> 26:28.080
It's very low maintenance and it seems to be net positive with the ladies.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.120
But I've noticed that strangers are ruder to me.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.680
Should I stick it out and get used to being perceived differently by people

26:33.680 --> 26:37.200
or grow my hair long and lovely again so as to fly to the gaydar

26:37.200 --> 26:40.640
and avoid the occasional embarrassing mistake about my gender?

26:40.640 --> 26:43.120
Fan from the post lesbian apocalypse.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.880
Is she asking us if she should be proud of her lesbianity?

26:46.880 --> 26:47.840
Her lesbianics?

26:48.480 --> 26:50.400
Well, she wants to be a lesbian.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.920
She doesn't want to be mistaken for a dude.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.120
Okay.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.480
But I guess that's...

26:54.480 --> 26:55.920
I do have to tell you though,

26:56.800 --> 27:01.680
this decision is largely out of your hands for the next month or so.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.200
So here's my advice.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.400
Try it for a month and see what you think.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.360
If you still don't like it, go along then.

27:09.360 --> 27:09.840
Here's...

27:09.840 --> 27:12.960
There are worse things that you could be mistaken for than a dude.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.400
Do you know what I'm saying?

27:14.400 --> 27:15.200
Liam Gallagher.

27:15.200 --> 27:15.760
Liam Gallagher.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.120
No, fucking Bieber.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.400
Bieber.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.040
You can look...

27:19.040 --> 27:23.200
You can get a Bieber, a sweet Bieber bowl and then you are in a lot of trouble.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.000
Unless your name is Justin and your last name is Bieber.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.720
And your middle name is whatever Justin Bieber's name is.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.520
Saul.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.320
Saul.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.960
Justin Saul Bieber.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.000
Justin Schmoo Bieber.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.200
No, here's all that coming.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.240
No, you know, it actually is Justin Osama Bieber.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.280
A lot of people don't know that.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.240
A lot of people don't know that.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.120
Hussein Bieber.

27:49.120 --> 27:49.920
Justin Hannah Montana Bieber.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.640
You know what?

27:50.640 --> 27:55.680
If you like it, if you like it, if you like your haircut, it's yours.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.480
It's your haircut.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.280
Own it.

27:57.280 --> 27:57.680
Yeah.

27:57.680 --> 27:58.240
Fuck people.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.280
Listen, if they're going to think you're a dude, they're obviously somebody you don't

28:01.280 --> 28:02.160
know very well.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.000
That's a pretty good litmus test as to whether or not they're useless.

28:06.000 --> 28:06.800
Hey, are you a dude?

28:06.800 --> 28:07.280
No.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.160
Like, fuck you.

28:08.160 --> 28:08.800
Get out of here.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.120
I don't...

28:09.120 --> 28:10.560
Like, I obviously don't want to chill with you.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.600
Look at my shapeliness.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.920
Look at my shapely curvaceousness.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.520
Look at this boom-bastic body.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.320
Excuse me?

28:18.880 --> 28:22.320
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot and slightly androgynous like me?

28:22.960 --> 28:25.200
Is my favorite pussycat doll song.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.360
There are so many, though.

28:27.360 --> 28:27.680
It's hard to choose.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.480
Yeah, there are so many.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.440
Buttons is good, too.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.000
Buttons is good.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.960
Pushing up my buttons.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.440
I like that.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.360
Mr. Boom-bastic.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.960
Mr. Boom-bastic.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.920
Oh, holy life.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.800
Don't make me sweat.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.280
That's another one.

28:39.280 --> 28:44.240
Duel of the Fates.

28:44.240 --> 28:48.240
Pussycat dolls are the most flexible artists of our times.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.560
Feem from my closet.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.000
They are unstoppable.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.760
The Declaration of Independence.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.600
Yeah, that hit song.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.840
Declaration of Independence.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.240
What?

29:02.240 --> 29:03.920
Now you're just naming documents.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.040
The Rosetta Stone.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.800
That's him.

29:06.800 --> 29:07.760
The Sphinx.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.760
The Empire State Building.

29:09.760 --> 29:10.720
What are we doing?

29:12.480 --> 29:15.040
We are fucked up our pasta.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.760
Oh, shit.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.400
Oh, my God.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.520
Holy shit.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.000
Jesus.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.200
Oh, my God.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.280
You just call me a self spaghetti.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.000
I'm feeling this pasta vibe.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.400
I've got to answer.

29:34.400 --> 29:34.720
Yes.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.040
Oh, Christ.

29:39.280 --> 29:39.680
Let's see.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.720
Declaration of Independence.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.280
You thought that was the song in the heat of the moment, didn't you?

29:45.280 --> 29:46.000
You can admit it.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.040
This one was sent in by John Ramsey.

29:49.040 --> 29:49.920
Thank you, John Ramsey.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Pretty, who asks,

29:53.520 --> 29:58.880
is marrying a robot, parentheses, with sexual capabilities, in parentheses,

29:58.880 --> 30:02.080
or an animal more socially unacceptable?

30:02.080 --> 30:03.040
Oh, God.

30:03.040 --> 30:06.960
The robot is designed so that you can, quotations, screw it.

30:08.400 --> 30:13.360
Is marrying a robot with sexual capabilities or an animal more socially,

30:13.360 --> 30:15.200
we'll say, more socially acceptable?

30:15.840 --> 30:16.320
Okay.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.960
We're going to pretend that we don't live in the same universe as Beast Wars,

30:20.960 --> 30:22.640
because I think that really matters a lot.

30:24.240 --> 30:24.560
Yeah.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.960
Well, I think in the epic case, Robo V. Bobo.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.440
Asshole.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.240
I think marrying a robot with sex capabilities is more acceptable,

30:38.240 --> 30:42.880
because I have seen Lars in the real girl, but I haven't seen Lars in the real alligator.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.680
I think the problem is that every time you introduce someone to your wife,

30:47.680 --> 30:51.120
you have to say, this is my wife, a robot with sexual capabilities.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.160
Yeah, check it.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.440
She's got holes in everything.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.480
She is ready to party.

30:54.480 --> 30:59.600
Is that better than, like, this is my wife, Tracy, she's not a real llama?

30:59.600 --> 31:00.800
What's up with that art, Mark?

31:00.800 --> 31:02.480
Don't you talk about my wife like that.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.440
We fuck all the time.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.680
Wait, so we're assuming the animal has sexual capabilities, right?

31:07.680 --> 31:08.800
It doesn't specify the question.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.840
I think pretty much all animals, although it depends on the size,

31:11.840 --> 31:16.720
because if we are talking about a porcupine, or, well, that's a bad example,

31:16.720 --> 31:21.280
but, I don't know, a hamster, well, still, fuck.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.680
There's a lot of sexy animals out there, you guys.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.720
It is a minefield.

31:26.640 --> 31:31.440
The worry, of course, with a fake girl is that you'll create an uncanny valley.

31:31.440 --> 31:31.760
Yeah.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.960
And that is the tightest leg.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.360
Oh, man, this was just a little less canny.

31:39.360 --> 31:45.520
Also, yeah, I worry about self-actualization, what's it called?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.920
Oh, like sentient.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.720
Well, I mean, if it's a fuck robot, I would hope that it's sentient,

31:50.720 --> 31:52.480
or else I'd feel like I'm with a vegetable.

31:52.480 --> 31:52.880
Yeah.

31:52.880 --> 31:58.560
I want somebody who, after a while, figures out this system that I've set up.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.440
You don't have to worry about that.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.360
Third law of robotics is don't harm a human.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.280
Fourth law of robotics, swallow.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.680
Yeah, this is true.

32:05.680 --> 32:06.560
We are in our daddy's house.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.760
I'm not making this up.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.960
We are in our daddy's house.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.520
I know.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.440
Fifth law, anniversary, anything goes.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.120
I want to marry a sex robot that has standards.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.480
Whisper at the rest of the house.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.920
We got to whisper at the rest of this question.

32:17.920 --> 32:18.800
I want to.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.080
Nope, I can't do it.

32:20.080 --> 32:20.800
You got it, you got it, you got it.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.520
No, I'm not listening.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.480
We're in our daddy's house.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.440
We're in daddy's house.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.400
I can't go wrong with this, at least first.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.080
Yeah, we got just this question.

32:28.080 --> 32:28.720
Just this question.

32:28.720 --> 32:33.920
I want to marry a sex robot with standards, like rules, or like, no, I don't do the butt.

32:33.920 --> 32:34.880
That's what I want.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.760
They have that program.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.800
You think that that would prevent them from going into a killing frenzy?

32:38.800 --> 32:40.640
Well, I mean, they have certain restrictions.

32:42.080 --> 32:46.480
Roger F's me all the time, but at least he gave me boundaries.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.240
He programmed those boundaries in it.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.440
I dig that, but I don't want to go wild on that.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.840
What about, ooh, a robot animal?

32:53.840 --> 32:54.720
Do we already cover this?

32:54.720 --> 32:55.360
Can we not do that?

32:55.360 --> 32:56.480
Yeah, we did a robot llama.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.520
With the Beast Wars contingent, I established that that can't be.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.000
But now Travis really wants to explore that space.

33:04.080 --> 33:04.580
Yeah.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.560
I mean, a dog is man's best friend.

33:08.560 --> 33:12.960
A robot dog is man's, like, brother.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.600
And a robot dog with fuck capabilities.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.560
Hey, are there any answers?

33:16.560 --> 33:19.120
Did anybody dip in to give it a shot?

33:19.120 --> 33:23.280
Uh, it's Romans 1, 24 through 27.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.400
You fucker.

33:24.400 --> 33:28.400
You're going to try to drop the Bible on this person like they never left

33:28.400 --> 33:31.200
traditional morality behind a few puppies ago.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.080
Robots one.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.680
Everyone, turn your Bibles to the fuck of robots.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.800
It's one chapter, one verse.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.640
It's robots one, one.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
Don't fuck robots, you weirdo.

33:44.640 --> 33:49.600
You know, I'm sure there's stuff in the rest of the Bible about fucking animals, though.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.640
Yeah, there's got to be.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.320
There's got to be.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.440
You'll find the book of robots.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.200
That was in the Dead Sea Scrolls, I believe.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.520
With memory serves.

33:58.080 --> 34:03.040
If you marry an animal, you're a freak into bestiality, e.g. a perv.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.520
And you're harming a living creature, so it's a double dose of perversion.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.840
Are we, like, all right, first of all, stop.

34:10.720 --> 34:11.520
Anybody just might...

34:11.520 --> 34:12.560
Like, fail.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.200
Stop that.

34:13.840 --> 34:19.920
Listen, you are assuming that what I do to my pet llama is harmful,

34:19.920 --> 34:22.000
and that it's, like, beautiful and natural.

34:22.000 --> 34:22.960
Like, you know what?

34:22.960 --> 34:23.920
Think of it this way.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.120
Did you guys hear about that law?

34:26.080 --> 34:28.160
Somebody just passed a law, I can't remember which state,

34:28.160 --> 34:29.840
probably one of the more fucked up ones,

34:29.840 --> 34:31.920
that says you can't have sex with an animal.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.200
But they worded it in a way that doesn't exclude human beings,

34:35.200 --> 34:36.480
because we're animals.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.600
So they basically made it...

34:37.600 --> 34:38.400
I think it's in Florida.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.840
You can't fuck in Florida anymore.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.320
Like, that's the law, is that you can't fuck in Florida.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.040
But that law brings up a good point, because we're animals too.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.160
I should be able to fuck whatever I want.

34:48.160 --> 34:51.360
Robots, not animals, not humanoid.

34:51.360 --> 34:55.760
They can be humanoid-shaped, but they can't feel like they're walls,

34:55.760 --> 34:58.640
like the walls of their vagina, like it doesn't...

34:58.640 --> 35:00.320
I see, right.

35:00.320 --> 35:04.080
It's not moist, is what I'm saying.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.160
You know, usually these things end with big laughs,

35:08.160 --> 35:10.480
and then we move on to that, Griffin, you've made it.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.800
Just dropped some science on everybody.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.600
I'm sold.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.360
Animals, animals, animals.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.120
Case closed.

35:17.120 --> 35:21.120
I'm interested in dating my brother's girlfriend's sister.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.560
Is it acceptable for brothers to date sisters?

35:24.560 --> 35:25.520
If one pair get married,

35:25.520 --> 35:27.520
did the other pair have to immediately break up?

35:27.520 --> 35:28.960
Tag team in Texas.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.720
I feel like this is one of those multilayered questions

35:30.720 --> 35:32.320
where someone's trying to trick us into saying

35:32.320 --> 35:33.600
it's okay to have sex with their sister.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.920
If we don't like, incept it and all.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.080
Hey, hold on, wait, is your sister an animal?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.360
I think she is.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.640
She's an animal called human, called homo erectus.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.880
Get it.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.040
Yeah.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.240
Actually, she's not human, she's a dancer, it says here.

35:51.440 --> 35:56.320
Okay, so my brother's girlfriend's sister.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.800
I think it's okay.

35:58.800 --> 36:02.480
Isn't that the plot of one of the Brady Bunch movies?

36:02.480 --> 36:03.520
All of them hook up with different couples?

36:03.520 --> 36:04.880
Guys, we didn't think about something.

36:04.880 --> 36:05.920
Tell me, tell me.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.240
Bicentennial Man.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.520
You start out with Robin Williams, pure, whole robot.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.120
By the end, he's a human being.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.760
He's had all of his robot parts replaced with human being parts

36:17.760 --> 36:20.400
and he can feel and die and maybe go to heaven.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.520
Like real people in heaven, like straight up real people heaven

36:23.520 --> 36:25.600
and not, well, robots don't get anything.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.200
But what do you think about that?

36:28.400 --> 36:30.720
Oh, now we're back to moral ambiguity.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.200
Yeah.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.080
Damn it.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt the flow.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.360
I would argue that if we eventually made him into Robin Williams,

36:37.360 --> 36:38.320
he's not a person.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.920
I think our bigger concern is once you open the floodgate on one of them,

36:43.920 --> 36:46.240
you're gonna end up with robots burying animals.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.080
If you open Robin Williams' floodgate, you could just get out of the way.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.840
He really isn't a person anymore.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.520
He's a typhoon of juggles.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.440
He is a comedy shadow.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.720
He is a walking awkward.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.720
Unpleasant with him right now.

36:58.720 --> 36:59.840
He's negative laughter.

36:59.840 --> 37:03.360
I'm unpleasant on the Paul he has cast over this show.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.280
Na-no, na-no.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.680
Na-no, no thanks, son of a bitch.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.680
Don't date your sister, you weird.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.720
No, she's saying...

37:11.360 --> 37:12.640
Your sister-in-law?

37:12.640 --> 37:14.400
No, don't do it because if one of you...

37:14.400 --> 37:15.760
I don't care about one of you getting married.

37:15.760 --> 37:20.880
I care about one of you breaking up because that will take you to the awkward village.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.040
How was your Christmas?

37:23.040 --> 37:23.520
It was great.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.800
There were sword fights because one of us dated and the other ones broke up.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.040
Just don't do it.

37:29.040 --> 37:29.680
Just don't do it.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.400
That was easy.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.040
That was easy.

37:31.040 --> 37:36.400
Romans 1, 15 through 16 says don't fuck your sister's sister.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.760
Sisters, brothers.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.800
Don't fuck anyone who is ever on the TV show Sister Sister.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.240
That includes Taj Mowry.

37:43.920 --> 37:48.560
I recently started to text and talk with an old college friend.

37:48.560 --> 37:52.800
It's been five years and we live a few states apart, but things seem to be progressing towards

37:52.800 --> 37:53.840
the romantic.

37:53.840 --> 37:59.280
My problem is I've gained a significant amount of weight since college, like a hundo, putting

37:59.280 --> 38:01.920
me at six to 300 lbs.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.960
Six to 300 lbs?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.400
I weigh between six and 300...

38:06.400 --> 38:08.800
No, six to 300 lbs.

38:08.800 --> 38:12.320
Do I mention this to her or just show up with some extra for her to love?

38:12.320 --> 38:13.920
Rotund romancer.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.240
Okay, you got to drop that nomenclature.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.480
Hey, I've got some branding to go along with this.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.200
That'd be good news.

38:21.200 --> 38:21.920
I got branded.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.080
Check out my Lycra jacket.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.840
They're stitched on the back.

38:25.840 --> 38:31.040
I say you need to update your Facebook with a current picture and just let the chips fall

38:31.040 --> 38:31.760
out of their way.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.160
With the caption, surprise!

38:34.160 --> 38:34.880
Surprise!

38:34.880 --> 38:35.440
This is it.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.880
No, I mean, if it's...

38:36.880 --> 38:37.760
What does she love?

38:37.760 --> 38:38.800
Does she love your heart?

38:39.440 --> 38:40.800
Does she love that heart of yours?

38:40.800 --> 38:42.320
It happens, guys.

38:43.520 --> 38:48.080
It happens from time to time that a person doesn't love this fame-filled frame.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.040
They love that heart.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.760
That sweet heart of mine.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.200
Is that the case that you're going with?

38:53.200 --> 38:56.160
Did your heart get fatter? Because if that's the case, it just means you have more love

38:56.160 --> 38:56.960
to give her.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.480
Here's what you should not do.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.720
Absolutely, you cannot mention it.

39:00.720 --> 39:01.200
No.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.360
Like, you can't say, hey, listen, just big news.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.080
Just heads up.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.040
I've really bulked up.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.520
You can't say that.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.560
Like, don't say that, but, you know, put some current pictures up there.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.680
And you know, there's also a good chance she's let herself go a little bit.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.560
How much shame can your frame handle?

39:14.560 --> 39:16.800
How much shame is in your frame?

39:16.800 --> 39:20.720
Get the shame out your frame and get your frame some fame.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.000
Maid, I want to be about a hundred pounds less.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.760
Maid, get down that episode.

39:25.760 --> 39:32.480
You can, I mean, you cannot do anything, but there, there may be a look on her face that

39:32.480 --> 39:34.480
you aren't going to be able to shake for a while.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.080
Oh, but imagine this beautiful moment.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.000
There's a look on her much fatter face.

39:38.000 --> 39:38.800
Oh, shit.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.840
Oh, no, Shrek.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.880
It's a Shrek ending.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.560
We're accidentally in love.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.240
He's got sh-

39:46.240 --> 39:47.760
I want to be a princess.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.280
I want to be a princess.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.800
I want to be a princess.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.840
You are a princess.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.720
Get over here.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.760
I have chicken.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.480
Hey, listeners, sorry about us.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.440
Hey, sorry about us.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.760
I think that you should just go for it.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.880
And if she turns you down, then she doesn't deserve you.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.880
Put a current picture up.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.000
If she says, is that current?

40:10.000 --> 40:13.200
Say, no, I'm chunking up and then stop eating.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.240
You got to get slimmer.

40:14.240 --> 40:14.960
Say, I'm going.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.920
I'm on my way down.

40:15.920 --> 40:16.480
I promise.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.280
Please don't leave me.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.960
Please, I need you so bad, Debbie.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.360
And if not, maybe, like, you guys will be friends or something.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.840
The worst five minutes of advice anybody's ever given anyone.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.520
Somebody go to CJ Maggies with.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.080
How about one final Yali?

40:32.080 --> 40:34.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.320
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.680
Thank you, Galiayali.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.760
It's by YaliLancer's user.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.960
Oh, no.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.880
The picture itself is pretty wonderful.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.960
The real Marty Janetti.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.960
Marty Janetti.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.960
Except no substance.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.240
Are you guys soaking in that image?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.040
Oh, man.

40:51.040 --> 40:52.480
That tiny thumbnail.

40:52.480 --> 40:53.200
It's a wrestler.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.080
He's holding a belt.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.280
Usually, if I don't know a celebrity, they're a wrestler.

40:58.880 --> 41:04.400
The real something something asks, how can I convince my girlfriend to dress up like

41:04.400 --> 41:06.320
Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka?

41:07.440 --> 41:09.200
I am in love with two ladies.

41:09.200 --> 41:09.760
OK.

41:09.760 --> 41:15.040
My sweet little Blueberry, a.k.a. my G friend, and Violet Beauregard from Willy Wonka.

41:15.040 --> 41:21.840
I think it's so sexy the when Violet inflates into a sphere and would love to see my lady

41:21.840 --> 41:22.880
do the same.

41:22.880 --> 41:27.840
How can I convince her that this would be both fun and sexy?

41:29.040 --> 41:33.280
She doesn't realize it yet, but her nickname comes from my number one screen crush.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.440
I bought the costume last week and I'm fighting up the courage to ask her,

41:39.440 --> 41:40.880
please, any suggestions?

41:40.880 --> 41:45.440
P.S. Not like in the new crappy Johnny Depp, Charlie and the Charge of Records.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.520
That CGI looked horrible.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.880
Only Mel Stuart's version.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.320
I can't.

41:50.320 --> 41:50.960
Oh, God.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.000
I can't finish unless it's the Mel Stuart's version.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.480
You look right now, Rashonda.

41:56.480 --> 42:02.560
You look beautiful, but you look like that shitty Johnny Depp version of Charlie and

42:02.560 --> 42:03.040
the Charge of Records.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.680
Honey, I got you this outfit and this bicycle pump.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.720
Let's go to town.

42:06.720 --> 42:07.200
Yeah.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.400
We are going to give you some artificial juice filled dumps.

42:10.400 --> 42:15.840
You ever hear that thing where it's like, if you press this button, you'll get a million

42:15.840 --> 42:18.240
dollars, but someone in the world will die.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.200
Do you press a button?

42:19.200 --> 42:22.800
If I can guarantee it's this guy, I'm just going to start hammering on it.

42:24.080 --> 42:24.880
Oh, man.

42:24.880 --> 42:30.160
How stealth do you have to be about your number one screen crush that you have given this

42:30.160 --> 42:35.360
girl a nickname, which is my little blueberry, and she doesn't know what it's referring to.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.680
You have to watch this movie, like, on the reg, right?

42:37.680 --> 42:41.920
Like, and you can tell he's got, like, a half motor, like, when she walks in the room.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.520
She swells, he swells, baby.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.720
That's how I do.

42:44.720 --> 42:45.840
That's gross.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.720
That is so unpleasant that you would like that so much.

42:48.720 --> 42:53.920
If you're going to get, if you're going to jerk it to anything in that movie, why not

42:53.920 --> 42:58.560
a Goose's Gloop getting sucked up in that chocolate pond, that chocolate tube?

42:58.560 --> 43:02.640
I feel like, I feel like we've just found a really great psychological test.

43:02.640 --> 43:08.320
There's like, if you had to jerk it to one scene in Willy Wonka, and your answer means

43:08.320 --> 43:09.280
something.

43:09.280 --> 43:13.760
How about if you jerked to any second about that movie, which is primarily about, primarily

43:13.760 --> 43:15.120
about murdering kids?

43:16.720 --> 43:20.400
Boy, there is a, you know what, as angry as I was about this guy, there is a much more

43:20.400 --> 43:24.240
unpleasant gentleman whose fetish is a little boy stuck in a chocolate tube.

43:24.240 --> 43:24.480
Yeah.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.120
Isn't it?

43:25.120 --> 43:28.480
I mean, there's that, you don't have to lay it out.

43:28.480 --> 43:33.120
The parts of your brain of fear and arousal are right next to each other is anything scarier

43:33.120 --> 43:38.560
than that, the look on that fucking kid's face when he's surrounded by plastic and tiny

43:38.560 --> 43:40.400
orange men and sweet chocolate.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.640
It's like, it's heaven and hell, baby.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.560
He knows, he knows death is around the corner.

43:44.560 --> 43:46.880
What about the girl that gets thrown in the incinerator?

43:46.880 --> 43:47.440
Yeah.

43:47.440 --> 43:48.960
That movie's terrifying.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.600
Why, why am I so erect then?

43:51.600 --> 43:53.520
Why am I, oh, that was a bad-

43:53.520 --> 43:56.880
There's no earthly way of knowing why I have this huge boner.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.680
That was a bad-

43:57.680 --> 43:58.720
Well, no, no, no.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.680
There is no earthly way of knowing why my boner is still growing.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.280
But the bulge is surely showing.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.160
Is it shrinking?

44:08.160 --> 44:08.880
Is it blowing?

44:09.520 --> 44:11.200
And the semen now is flowing.

44:11.200 --> 44:30.880
So I want to hear Griffin's very last question.

44:30.880 --> 44:35.280
But first, I wanted to say, well, we have a live show.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.720
It's going to be June 12th.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.200
We have a handful of tickets left.

44:39.200 --> 44:42.480
And I'm not saying that they say it to try to encourage people to buy.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.320
We literally have 10 seats left.

44:44.320 --> 44:47.360
We have those on Sunday night, and the show's going up on Monday morning.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.280
So no guarantees.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.240
And hopefully, we've talked about it on Twitter and our Facebook as much as we can.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.040
And on our website.

44:53.040 --> 44:53.840
And our website.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.080
Yeah, it's all on MaximumFun.org.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.160
So if you don't get tickets, we're sorry.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.680
We're going to keep doing these live shows.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.440
So this isn't the last chance.

45:01.440 --> 45:07.280
And this one's, hopefully we'll be able to, we're all close enough to Cincinnati.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.920
Maybe we can do this again at some point if you miss out on the show.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.000
Because the response has been so awesome for you guys.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.720
Thank you so much, guys.

45:12.720 --> 45:13.360
We really appreciate it.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.160
Christ.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.000
And we're still shopping for opening acts.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.440
We've got a few really good leads.

45:17.440 --> 45:22.480
But if you live in Cincinnati or know a really great comic or band or anything like that

45:22.480 --> 45:25.520
in Cincinnati, at this point, I'm really excited about Magician.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.840
It's something I'm leaning towards.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.560
I'm getting some fight from the brothers.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.760
I would take a Magician at this point.

45:33.760 --> 45:34.960
Can we get a ball pit?

45:34.960 --> 45:36.640
You mean just like a half hour ball pit?

45:36.640 --> 45:39.680
Like I don't, like yeah, like we just put the ball pit up there and it's just like, go nuts.

45:39.680 --> 45:42.160
We originally said that we could have another podcast open for us.

45:42.160 --> 45:46.880
And we did have a couple of suggestions, but we were worried that they could be better than ours.

45:46.880 --> 45:47.680
And we can't have that.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.720
So we've got to have somebody who's not a podcast now.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.280
We've decided.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.960
Because that's the kind of insecurity we're talking about here.

45:52.960 --> 45:56.800
And if you're already going to be in town, I'll give you your coming in town Cincinnati,

45:56.800 --> 46:00.560
might I suggest checking out complete works of William Shakespeare Bridge at the Cincinnati

46:00.560 --> 46:01.520
Shakespeare Company.

46:01.520 --> 46:06.400
Who, they are wonderfully hosting our show.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.520
So if you want to check that out in the afternoon and then come see our show at night,

46:09.520 --> 46:10.880
I highly recommend it.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.400
They act really fucking good.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.200
They act so good.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.480
All of them act really good.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.200
So thank you guys.

46:17.200 --> 46:23.200
We love it when people tweet on Twitter about our show and use the NBNBAM hashtag.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.160
So we make sure to see it.

46:26.160 --> 46:31.760
Rickman is a relatively new convert, I think.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.480
He was tweeting up a storm.

46:36.800 --> 46:37.200
Let's see.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.640
Our buddy Rhymeswag.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.880
He's a relatively new tweeter.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.040
I haven't seen him popping up too much.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.360
I do like IP and butts, which is a good.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.200
Oh, wait, wait.

46:47.200 --> 46:47.600
I love this.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.320
Go back down.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.360
This guy's my favorite.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.920
Onk Monk says at the NBNBAM.

46:51.920 --> 46:52.480
Fuck you.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.560
Got us.

46:54.560 --> 46:55.120
Got us.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.320
Nailed us again.

46:56.960 --> 47:02.480
I want to hand out a special congratulations to my friend Sabrina and Chris.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.920
They just had a baby.

47:03.920 --> 47:08.240
And I'm going to go ahead and name it Travis McElroy's pick for my brother, my brother,

47:08.240 --> 47:09.360
and me baby of the year.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.000
The most pinchable baby of 2000 and heaven.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.920
So let's give that up to Benjamin Prometheus Stoker.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.720
Real name.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.560
The sweetest baby.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.360
What a great baby.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.320
