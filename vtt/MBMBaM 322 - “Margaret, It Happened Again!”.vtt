00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.320
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.640
I'm your sweet baby brother. Crack that beverage, baby, Griffin McElroy. The energy in the studio

00:58.640 --> 01:05.040
is alive and electric. Cracklin, cracklin, cracklin. Bazinga, this energy's good. Cracklin,

01:05.040 --> 01:08.160
oat brand, the energy bouncing from Justin and me, me to Justin.

01:08.160 --> 01:14.640
Welcome to the Zeitgeist, folks. We are just riding a cultural wave right now,

01:15.760 --> 01:24.720
thanks to our hot new party game, Which One Vapes? As you know, we invented this hit party game

01:24.720 --> 01:32.400
accidentally last week, and it has taken on a life of its own created by Auburn Wood,

01:33.200 --> 01:39.040
who actually went through and made the, almost to our exact specifications.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.800
Yeah, this is well-tailored.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.800
My only regret about the whole thing is that we've got this just title wave of fun game

01:46.800 --> 01:51.920
that we did not think of any way to monetize at all.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.920
It's a gift. We'll come up with another one next time.

01:53.920 --> 01:59.600
Wait, Jay Alexander or David Letterman? Ms. J or Mr. D?

02:00.560 --> 02:01.120
Damn.

02:01.120 --> 02:08.080
Damn. You know Ms. J's got a fashionable rig. It's like a cane,

02:08.080 --> 02:13.280
like a fashionable cane that Ms. J lifts up to those lips and then vape juice comes out.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.560
Here's what I'm going to give you guys.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.280
Please.

02:15.280 --> 02:23.040
This is created, it is like not, this is a scientific process, and I have proof.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.120
Because I have leaderboards here, the least likely and most likely to vape,

02:27.120 --> 02:29.600
let me go through the least likely to vape first.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.400
Oh, excellent.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.760
Starting from number six and going backwards.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.520
And we promise we aren't going to talk about vaping this episode as much as we did last episode.

02:35.520 --> 02:40.480
Yeah, but this is a cultural zeitgeist. The Daily Dot said that this is an important website.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.120
Very important.

02:41.120 --> 02:41.760
And very important.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.120
It's been sent to the library of Congress.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.120
So here we go. Number six, Michelle Obama.

02:47.120 --> 02:47.520
Yes.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.040
Definitely not vaping. Yeah, so she's the least likely.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.040
She's the number six least likely to vape.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.640
She's not the most least likely to vape.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.000
I see, I see, I see.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.240
Number five, Vanessa Redgrave.

02:58.240 --> 02:58.640
Yes.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.640
Four, Bruce Lee. Fair.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.280
Number three, Joan Plowright.

03:03.280 --> 03:03.840
Okay.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.200
Number two, Kate Bach.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.960
Coming in at number one, most human being most least likely to vape.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.000
Most, no, okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.400
Number one least likely to vape, Dorothy Danridge.

03:12.400 --> 03:12.960
Okay.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.520
Accurate.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.600
Okay, now here's our top six.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.920
Going to number one, heading to number one, most likely to vape.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.400
Justin wouldn't let us look at this beforehand because-

03:22.400 --> 03:26.800
This is proving to me that this is a scientifically accurate process.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.120
Okay.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.960
Number six, Jared Leto.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.520
Yes.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.120
Maybe even should be higher.

03:31.120 --> 03:31.600
Well, I don't know.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.160
Let's see.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.360
There might be some superstars up on top.

03:35.360 --> 03:35.760
Hang on, hang on.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.280
Number five, Dane Cook.

03:37.280 --> 03:37.680
Yes.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.280
Holy shit.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.080
So good.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.240
Number four, Johnny Depp.

03:42.240 --> 03:42.720
Wow.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.960
Oh my god, these are very good.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.760
Number three, Shia LaBeouf.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.480
Yes.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.000
I'm not sure about that one.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.520
I feel like he's ranking a bit high there.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.720
Yeah, I feel like maybe-

03:52.720 --> 03:54.080
Number two is Macklemore.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.880
And number one, John Leguizamo, of course.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.680
No, number one is Criss Angel.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.440
Oh, holy shit.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.080
Wow.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.800
He probably has literal vape magic tricks.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.920
He probably vapes and there's no vape rig around.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.280
And people are like, how did you do that?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.640
And he's just like, mind freak.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.000
I don't want our vaping listeners, because I know

04:18.000 --> 04:21.600
there's a contingent of them, to feel like we are in any way

04:21.600 --> 04:22.640
marginalizing you.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.880
There is not a stigma attached.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.840
I don't have a word to attach to this stigma,

04:27.840 --> 04:30.800
because I don't necessarily dislike these people.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.560
I'm just like, yeah, that's right.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.600
I don't think we are either pro or against,

04:35.600 --> 04:38.400
so much as we're just like, this is a thing that's going on.

04:38.400 --> 04:38.960
Sorry, boys.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.240
I didn't understand what you're talking about.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.400
I'm very much against these people.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.000
Oh, not those people.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.720
I'm talking about vape.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.440
Say for Shia.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.880
I think it's time for Shia to find his way back.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.360
But I don't know.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.320
I don't want our vaping listeners

04:52.320 --> 04:54.880
to feel like we're picking on them or making fun of them.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.600
That's not accurate.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.320
Where's our ranking?

04:56.320 --> 04:57.440
Because I know we're in the mix.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.880
And then there's a special section

04:58.880 --> 05:00.880
that is brothers most to least likely to vape.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.240
Number three, Justin McElroy.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.280
Number two, Travis McElroy.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.760
Number one brother most likely to vape, Griffin McElroy.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.120
I would think I was least likely to vape.

05:07.120 --> 05:07.840
Here's the thing.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.360
I do talk about cotton and rev.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.640
I know the most terminology.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.600
You do know a lot of terms.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.440
That's just, I'm an admirer of the tumblers.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.840
You're more a fanatic than you are like a brother.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.280
Like if you knew a lot about baseball,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.520
that doesn't mean you're most likely to play baseball.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.160
That's true.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.840
That just means you follow the sport.

05:21.840 --> 05:22.560
So anyway.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.240
Weak low lung capacity.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.600
So not built for the stuff.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.840
So anyway, whichonvapes.com is that website.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.800
It's whichonvapes.com.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.160
Oh, you've got the actual redirect.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.200
I booked it last time.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.400
And now the redirect is working.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.440
So whichonvapes.com.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.400
Shout out to Auburn.

05:36.240 --> 05:41.920
Auburn pulled down the URL, whichonvap.es, which is good shit.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.720
Very good, too.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.000
But now the redirect is working.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.440
Gene Hagan versus Margot Robbie.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.880
Oh, I don't think Margot.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.160
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.920
I actually think it's Margot Robbie.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.680
OK, and there's some odd ones in there for some reason.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.040
A Mako Shark is one of the options that people have popped up.

05:59.040 --> 05:59.520
Anyway.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.680
This is our last episode that we're recording all together

06:01.680 --> 06:05.440
before we wrap on the show this Friday with The Candlelight

06:05.440 --> 06:08.480
Show, which I'm excited to see everybody at.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.240
Going to be a big fun crowd.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.800
And then next week, back to remote, back to the distance.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.280
I've grown so used to recording with you guys in the same room,

06:17.280 --> 06:19.840
I don't know how I'll return to the comfort of not

06:19.840 --> 06:21.440
having to stare at your faces.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.880
It's going to be real good.

06:22.880 --> 06:23.680
We'll figure it out.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.640
But anyway, thanks for hanging in with us.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.440
And we love you all very much.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.400
And now it is time to do what we get paid to do.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.440
What brought us here.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.280
It is time to dance with Hoobrunga.

06:38.160 --> 06:38.640
Advice.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.400
Advice brung us.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.280
Advice brung us.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.240
And now we're bringing advice.

06:42.240 --> 06:42.960
Here it comes.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.440
I love my fiance and we've lived together for almost three years.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.440
However, she has one annoying habit.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.840
She always drinks only two thirds of a glass of water

06:51.840 --> 06:55.760
and then just leaves the still partially full cup behind.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.840
I keep asking her to either finish them or take them to the kitchen to be washed.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.840
She insists she may want to finish it later.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.280
Nonsense.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.320
So my question is this.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.480
How do I get her to clean up her mess?

07:06.480 --> 07:09.440
Or should I be concerned about an upcoming invasion of Earth by aliens whose skin is

07:09.440 --> 07:10.080
burned by water?

07:10.960 --> 07:12.800
Death from terribly vexed and Terre Haute.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.520
Yeah, I mean, it's got amoebas in it.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.080
Yeah, it's got amoebas.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.840
That's what the girl in the amoeba says.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.600
There's an important question here, which is,

07:20.720 --> 07:26.800
is there any frequency at which she does actually ever pick up old glasses and drink out of them?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.240
Or does she just constantly say,

07:28.240 --> 07:29.040
I may want to finish it later and never does it?

07:29.040 --> 07:33.520
Yeah, is there any evidence to support this I'll finish it later theory?

07:33.520 --> 07:34.000
I don't know.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.440
Why are you looking at me?

07:35.440 --> 07:36.000
I didn't ask the question.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.200
Answer the fucking question, Justin.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.000
What are you hiding, Justin?

07:38.000 --> 07:38.880
Follow the money.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.200
I don't know.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.400
I mean, I wouldn't think so.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.600
I think if she was cleaning up after herself, this would be quite the odd question.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.080
Also, no one has ever looked at the,

07:48.080 --> 07:52.160
no one has ever been thirsty and looked at a third cup of anything and thought,

07:52.160 --> 07:53.200
mmm, yeah.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.280
Ooh, age to perfection.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.760
You never, like, in an ad for Pepsi,

07:57.760 --> 08:02.960
you never see somebody just pick up a one-third full cup of flat Pepsi and be like,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.720
mmm, the taste of the next generation.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.880
What's the tipping point for water?

08:06.880 --> 08:08.160
Because there's definitely,

08:08.160 --> 08:10.160
I have a glass of water at my bedside every night,

08:10.160 --> 08:14.480
and my bedtime routine is make a pee-pee, brush my teeth first,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.240
and then get a new glass of water,

08:16.240 --> 08:17.840
because I won't drink that old shit.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.960
Here's an old glass of water.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.680
Here's an old glass.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.280
There's literally two within reach.

08:21.280 --> 08:21.600
Yeah.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.400
What's the tipping point?

08:22.400 --> 08:24.320
Like, how many hours old does it,

08:24.320 --> 08:27.120
and what's getting in there to make it taste so weird?

08:27.120 --> 08:27.760
Because it does.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.320
It does taste weird.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.840
You know, Griffin, for me, it's a sliding scale.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.920
I can put my finger on it, but the answer for me is,

08:31.920 --> 08:39.040
if I can't remember when I put it down, it's too old.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.960
Because at that point, who put it down?

08:40.960 --> 08:41.600
Exactly.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.240
Because that's the thing.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.760
I don't know why my fear with old water is always,

08:45.760 --> 08:47.920
did someone else perhaps touch this?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.840
That's why I put ice cubes in my drink,

08:49.840 --> 08:51.360
not because I like the coolness of it,

08:51.360 --> 08:55.280
but because ice cubes are like, hey, this shit's still good to go.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.120
Listen, this is weird to me,

08:57.120 --> 09:01.680
because if I screw up my courage enough to actually drink just plain water,

09:01.680 --> 09:04.720
I get the cup, I fill it with some water,

09:04.720 --> 09:07.440
I drink as much as I'm going to, and I put the cup back right away.

09:07.440 --> 09:07.600
No, I've noticed-

09:07.600 --> 09:09.360
I don't carry water with me.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.840
That's a lie, because I've noticed you have a fun little blue bottle,

09:11.840 --> 09:13.040
and it's like your water friend.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.080
Well, that's a water bottle.

09:14.080 --> 09:14.960
That's different.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.040
Yeah, but like, you just lied to us.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.960
Oh, that's a good solution, though.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.240
Get some sort of like one of those aluminum bottle buddies

09:22.240 --> 09:24.960
for your girlfriend, and be like, okay, great.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.400
This you can seal back up, and then actually drink later.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.280
I know what you're saying.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.920
Yeah, get her a helmet with slots for two cups on it.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.480
Exactly.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.640
And straws that come down from them, and she can just slurp all they love.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.320
And that's fun, too, because you can decorate it

09:38.320 --> 09:42.000
to be like her favorite pro sports team.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.200
Pro wrestler.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.080
Maybe you put some horns on there, like a big mohawk.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.200
That's fun.

09:47.200 --> 09:47.920
That's fun.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.720
And you got to stay hydrated, and you got to stay fun with it.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.600
That's what I always say.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.360
That's what relationships are really about,

09:53.920 --> 09:57.280
forcing your partner to drink in the way that you are most comfortable.

09:57.280 --> 09:57.840
Exactly.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.640
Just shaping them to be more what you think they should be.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.120
What's up with water, though?

10:03.120 --> 10:07.440
Because I'll never leave a third of a cup of Diet Dr. Pepper sitting around.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.640
That's Diet Dr. Pepper.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.560
Somebody's been cleaning up after you for two weeks.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.400
I'm going to go ahead and say that's incorrect.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.360
It's good to go.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.040
That's Diet Dr. Pepper.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.040
I would never leave a soldier behind like that.

10:17.040 --> 10:21.280
Water, I can get you out of the same room that the toilet's in, Water.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.560
That's what you are to me.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.200
If you think about it, it's completely nonsensical.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.760
Don't worry about a glass of water sitting out in the air.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.160
Because that's the same air you're breathing.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.440
It's different, though.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.200
Except in one circumstance, if it's under a ceiling fan,

10:37.200 --> 10:38.880
because everything's coming off that fan.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.840
Yeah, that's it.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.360
Everything's coming off that fan.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.960
Let's establish some danger zones.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.640
Now, Justin just spilled some Monster Energy drink on himself.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.800
Under the ceiling fan, can't drink that water ever again.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.480
There's a lot of bad stuff in there.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.640
Under the air conditioning vent, I don't know who's up there or what they're doing.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.720
Other places, if I enter the bathroom with a cup of water, that's where that lives now.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.360
Because the bathroom air is bad.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.800
Kitchen, I don't know.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.640
Chicken particles could be floating around in there.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.360
Salmonella.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.560
Can't have the water around there.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.240
This might just be very localized to me.

11:08.240 --> 11:12.000
But if I see my cat within 30 feet of it, I can't trust it.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.560
Because my cat will shove her whole face into a glass

11:14.560 --> 11:16.640
to get a little sip of water from my water.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.800
Why does the water taste different, though?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.520
What's getting in there to make it taste so bad?

11:21.520 --> 11:22.080
Fluoride.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.120
The fluoride's in it before it starts.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.960
But then it controls your mind and tells you it tastes bad,

11:26.960 --> 11:29.040
so you drink more, so you get the water pressure's up.

11:29.040 --> 11:29.760
Follow the money.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.720
Is it dust?

11:31.360 --> 11:33.440
Is it just dust particles from...

11:33.440 --> 11:35.840
I'm breathing it all the time.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.340
Here.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.240
I'm not tasting the bad taste in my mouth from the air.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.320
Griffin, perhaps your supposition is incorrect.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.600
It's not what's getting into the water, but rather what is leaving the water.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.680
All the good flavors evaporating out as it sits in the open air.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.120
This is all perspective, though.

11:51.120 --> 11:56.560
Did you ever have friends in school when they showed up and they had a smell?

11:56.560 --> 11:58.400
That was just what their house smelled like.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.840
You knew that you'd left some clothes there

12:01.840 --> 12:03.840
because they would have that person's house smell.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.280
Nobody knows their own house smell.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.000
That's true.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.680
I worry about that all the time.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.680
Go away from your house for two weeks and come back,

12:09.680 --> 12:11.440
and you're like, oh, this is me.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.320
This is my brand.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.640
That's really actually very jarring when you're on vacation for a week

12:16.640 --> 12:17.440
and you come back and you're like, whoa.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.480
Who made grilled cheese?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.040
Oh, wait a minute.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.000
It's always grilled cheese up in here.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.040
That's always my house.

12:21.040 --> 12:21.760
Oh, no.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.120
I'm grilled cheese man.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.680
And everyone else who's ever come into my house knows it.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.960
That's why Candles got invented.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.280
It's just air hacking.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.840
I call Candles air hackers.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.960
Hey, do you have a Yahoo?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.160
Hack the air.

12:34.160 --> 12:34.880
I got this one.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.080
I'm gonna send him by level 9,000.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.920
Yeah, Drew answers user Johnny, who asks,

12:41.200 --> 12:43.840
by the way, we got to talk about that hack.

12:44.560 --> 12:48.400
There's a Yahoo hack, like 500 million accounts exposed.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.000
How's your guys shit going?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.840
Doesn't sound like it's going very good.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.800
Hey, Yahoo answers are definitely gonna be dead like by next week, right?

12:54.800 --> 12:57.040
You're gonna have to sell it to pay for all the accounts.

12:57.040 --> 12:57.680
All the hacks.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.480
All the hacking.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.280
Okay, great.

12:59.280 --> 13:05.920
Hey, their information got 500 million people hacked, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.800
Half a bill, no big deal.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.000
Half a bill, no big deal.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.760
Who has got Yahoo account?

13:09.760 --> 13:12.000
Like, what are you keeping on there?

13:12.000 --> 13:12.960
What are the secrets?

13:14.640 --> 13:15.520
All right, Griff, I'm ready.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.640
Hit me with Yahoo.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.200
All right, this one is asked by Yahoo answers user Johnny, who asks,

13:20.640 --> 13:22.320
are roller coaster good for you?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.440
Update, like for your body.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.560
Are roller coaster good for you?

13:29.920 --> 13:31.520
Are roller coaster good for you?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.920
Let's talk about the health benefits of a coaster.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.080
Good for, here's what I say, massages, very good for you.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.920
Moving the toxins around, I guess.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.160
Yeah.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.640
Squeezing the nodules and getting the bad stuff out

13:44.640 --> 13:47.200
and moving the bad stuff to the good nodules.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.840
And then releasing the knots and the tension and the aura.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.200
I think a good coaster, flipsy spins all around.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.120
And when you get out of the end of it, your muscles are all confused

13:57.120 --> 13:58.560
and just loose and wild.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.040
I think it's like a reverse massage.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.920
It's like putting tension into the body.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.960
It's not rubbing you in the specific way you need to be rubbed.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.240
Let me posit a circumstance in which it can be very good for your body.

14:12.240 --> 14:12.960
Okay.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.560
A kidney stone.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.520
Just breaks it all up.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.240
Well, you got lodged in there, you can't get it out.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.840
You can't get the kidney stone out.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.320
Maybe it's lodged in there, shaped like an arrowhead

14:22.320 --> 14:24.160
and it's buried in like the wall of your kidney.

14:24.160 --> 14:24.960
Jesus, come on.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.760
I'm sorry, Griffin.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.640
So you're positing that like,

14:28.640 --> 14:30.640
oh, I have a really big kidney stone.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.840
What am I gonna do today?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.240
I think I'm gonna hit up Great Adventure.

14:34.240 --> 14:34.960
Just get out there.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.360
Yeah.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.560
Is Great Adventure a park?

14:36.560 --> 14:37.120
It's a park, isn't it?

14:37.120 --> 14:37.680
I have no fucking idea.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.640
Let me try one that I know.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.840
I'm gonna go to King's Island.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.480
Yeah.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.160
Yeah, I feel like we talk about King's Island a lot.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.120
King's Island's really great.

14:43.120 --> 14:47.520
I think roller coaster good for me because,

14:47.520 --> 14:48.240
and this is just like,

14:49.040 --> 14:50.080
I don't know if you guys know this about me,

14:50.080 --> 14:51.280
it's just like a fun weird,

14:51.280 --> 14:54.160
like a very random, just like funny thing.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.920
It's the only way I can get a boner.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.360
Oh no, what?

14:57.360 --> 14:58.080
Yeah.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.600
So I'll hop on like the Harry Potter experience.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.480
I haven't actually been there,

15:02.480 --> 15:06.800
but I'm sure I would go hog hyphen wild on it.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.960
But yeah, I'll just go on a roller coaster

15:08.960 --> 15:10.960
and get a bone bone and then, you know.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.400
Is that good for you?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.360
It'll last me a little, you know, long enough.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.680
And then it's, I guess,

15:17.680 --> 15:20.080
I mean, the closest amusement park to me

15:20.080 --> 15:22.720
is Six Flags Fiesta, Texas,

15:23.600 --> 15:26.480
which is about an hour and a half drive.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.480
So it takes some work.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.200
Is it really called Six Flags Fiesta, Texas?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
And I don't think it's in a town called Fiesta.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.920
I think it's just like letting you know,

15:35.920 --> 15:40.480
hey, it's time to party, specifically Griffin.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.600
So I have an annual pass.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.120
They basically just let me come and go.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.160
I'm good friends with Barry who runs the rides there.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.120
All the rides, huh?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.960
Well, just the one closest to the entrance

15:48.960 --> 15:50.960
because I'll just like run in there, just dart in there.

15:50.960 --> 15:51.600
Be like, yo, Barry.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.600
He's like, yo, trying to get wood?

15:53.600 --> 15:54.480
And I'm like, yeah.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.600
And so I'll hop on it.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.640
So Barry knows.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.080
Yeah, Barry knows, Barry knows, Barry knows.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.720
And then we'll go and then there's a, yeah.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.040
I don't think roller coasters are good for your body.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.120
Well, I disagree because it's the, again,

16:05.120 --> 16:07.200
it's the only way I get more.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.840
Yeah, okay, you've got an affliction.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.680
I'm saying like by and large,

16:11.680 --> 16:12.800
I think there's like,

16:12.800 --> 16:14.640
I think you're kind of getting beat up in there.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.640
I don't know that I've ever gotten off a roller coaster

16:16.640 --> 16:18.320
and thought, ah, better.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.200
That's the stuff.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
Is adrenaline good for your body though?

16:20.800 --> 16:21.760
Fuck yeah, dude.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.600
Fight or flight getting triggered?

16:23.600 --> 16:25.200
That's good because you go in there and you,

16:25.200 --> 16:26.240
like you go into,

16:26.240 --> 16:28.000
sometimes you just got to fight a roller coaster.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.720
You know what I mean?

16:28.720 --> 16:29.280
Yeah.

16:29.280 --> 16:29.760
Yeah.

16:29.760 --> 16:33.040
It's a very aggressive, very just sexual experience.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.480
It's just being on a roller,

16:34.480 --> 16:34.960
just being on a good coaster.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.640
Is it the loops that give you the wood Griffin?

16:36.640 --> 16:37.200
The what now?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.640
I don't want to, I don't want to circle back,

16:38.640 --> 16:39.840
but is it the loops that give you the wood?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.920
I think it's just a blood flow thing.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.320
It's getting on one with a good corkscrew

16:44.320 --> 16:45.680
and then the centrifugal force

16:45.680 --> 16:47.440
just puts my blood exactly where I need it.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.720
The tip of your penis.

16:48.720 --> 16:48.960
Well.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.680
It's a little lewd Travis.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.680
It's a little lewd to talk about that.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.600
Are roller coasters good for your body though?

16:55.600 --> 16:56.000
Do you think?

16:56.800 --> 16:57.280
Probably.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.000
Holistically speaking, I think they're like a net loss.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.600
I think you get bruised.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.120
I think you get shaken all around.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.080
Sometimes your head goes,

17:08.000 --> 17:08.800
between the two head rest.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.680
This is true.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.240
Could you make a roller coaster that is good for your body?

17:12.240 --> 17:12.560
Okay.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.480
I'm saying that maybe like,

17:14.480 --> 17:15.440
that's what you go into,

17:15.440 --> 17:16.480
design like,

17:16.480 --> 17:17.200
hey everybody,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.720
this roller coaster is going to feel like a nap.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.600
At the bottom,

17:19.600 --> 17:20.320
what about this?

17:20.320 --> 17:21.680
At the bottom of the dip.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.480
Going up, going up,

17:24.480 --> 17:25.200
going up, going up.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.200
I'm going down.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.080
I'm screaming.

17:28.080 --> 17:28.880
My mouth is open.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.200
What's at the bottom?

17:31.200 --> 17:31.920
Salad.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.480
You're just going through, you're fine.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.520
You're just like shoving it in there.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.800
And then halfway through the ride,

17:37.800 --> 17:41.200
it just stops for 45 minutes and like a pillow comes out

17:41.200 --> 17:42.420
and you can just take like,

17:42.420 --> 17:44.000
just a quick 45 minute nap

17:44.000 --> 17:45.200
because that's always good for everybody.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.120
45 minute nap is a fucking nightmare

17:47.120 --> 17:47.960
and I wish you would know.

17:47.960 --> 17:48.800
21 minute nap?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.880
26 minute nap is like where you want to be.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.400
Well, agree to disagree, I prefer 21 minutes.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.000
So Emma Martina Luigia Marano,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.200
born 29 November 1899, is the oldest living person.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.600
And by the way, internet,

18:02.600 --> 18:05.000
it took me a way too long to figure this out.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.120
We should just, if I type oldest,

18:07.120 --> 18:09.360
then there should be a website called oldest living person

18:09.360 --> 18:10.560
that just tracks that shit.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.720
Maybe that's the next project

18:11.720 --> 18:13.840
from the people who brought you which one vapes.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.920
Anyway, Emma, huge coaster head.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.280
So there's something, there's something there.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.240
What's the quote?

18:20.240 --> 18:22.140
Is there, you said there was a quote in there

18:22.140 --> 18:25.360
about like how much Emma loves coasters.

18:25.360 --> 18:29.060
Yeah, it says, boy howdy,

18:29.060 --> 18:31.200
I just love getting spun around

18:31.200 --> 18:33.480
and getting wood on these coasties.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Wait a minute.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.940
And it says I can't do them anymore though

18:39.200 --> 18:42.360
because I would turn to dust if I went on a roller.

18:42.360 --> 18:46.160
If this woman went on Son of Beast at Kings Island,

18:46.160 --> 18:48.160
she would just be reduced to ash.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.480
Doesn't, it doesn't, it's been closed for a half decade.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.800
She would, it would be quite a feat

18:51.800 --> 18:53.720
if she went on the non-existent roller coaster.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.000
But anyway, huge coaster head, Emma Marano.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.640
No big deal, just like 116 years old.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.480
That's pretty good.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.940
116 years young.

19:01.940 --> 19:02.780
No, old.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.280
No, she's very old actually.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.160
Looking really good though.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.540
The top result is also Emma Martina Luigi Marano diet.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.280
If you type in Emma, then like it fills to that

19:13.280 --> 19:14.400
because you know some people are like,

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
I wanna be 116.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.760
Secret, I'm guessing, lots of pasta,

19:18.760 --> 19:22.120
lots of coasties, lots of wood.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.720
Okay, that's one option.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.920
That's one option is just you gotta move the blood around

19:26.920 --> 19:29.480
and you gotta fill that tummy with pasta.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.840
Gotta get that wood.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.760
The last few days, someone has left a bike

19:32.760 --> 19:34.200
parked on my sidewalk near my house.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.240
Kickstand down, no lock.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.600
Just standing there and not even in front of any residents.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.800
It's not in bad shape.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.160
It only needs a new front tire to be rideable.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.860
I was sitting there for three days straight

19:44.860 --> 19:45.700
with no movement. It was sitting there.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.120
You weren't sitting there watching it, just not moving,

19:48.120 --> 19:50.660
afraid the bike would run away if you made sudden movements.

19:50.660 --> 19:53.660
It was sitting there for about three days straight

19:53.660 --> 19:56.380
with no movement or anyone coming to get it.

19:56.380 --> 19:59.800
So I said, fuck it and took it, am I good?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.840
That was from Cycle Salvage in the American South.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.780
It's from bike thief in Birmingham.

20:05.780 --> 20:08.240
Thief, a bike taker.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.680
This person's a bike thief, right?

20:09.680 --> 20:10.520
Yeah, you took the bike.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.360
I'm sorry, you're back.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.040
Like, how long would a car need to sit on the street

20:14.040 --> 20:16.440
before you're like, no one's coming back for this car, yeah.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.440
That hooptie's got a busted spoiler.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.400
I'm just gonna take it.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.240
What?

20:21.240 --> 20:22.600
It sat in front of my house for three days

20:22.600 --> 20:24.800
and no one moved the car, so I guess it's a free car.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.920
You know, I tried the handle and it was unlocked,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.240
so I grand thefted the auto.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.160
You can't just take a thing

20:31.160 --> 20:32.800
because someone left it stationary.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.800
This thing is old and bad, so it's mine now.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.540
It wasn't a fucking cat that you found outside

20:38.540 --> 20:41.560
that was hungry, it was a person's bicycle

20:41.560 --> 20:43.720
that maybe they need to reinflate the front tire,

20:43.720 --> 20:45.160
but that's no excuse.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.340
You're on some wisdom of Solomon shit,

20:47.340 --> 20:50.200
like the bike goes to the person who loves it the most.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.960
And maybe you're about to like try to deny this,

20:51.960 --> 20:53.000
but let me ask you this,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.040
and be brutally honest with both me and yourself.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.840
What kind of due diligence did you do?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.200
Did you put signs up that were like,

21:00.200 --> 21:02.080
hey, if you come looking for this bike,

21:02.080 --> 21:03.880
I've got it, it's safe, you can have it,

21:03.880 --> 21:05.800
or were you just like, this is mine,

21:05.800 --> 21:07.400
no one will ever know this is mine?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.320
Like how much work did you do to make sure

21:10.320 --> 21:13.080
the rightful owner would not think,

21:13.080 --> 21:15.240
I know, crazy, it was just stolen?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.960
It's just, you just stole it.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.120
You just kind of stole a bike a little bit.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.280
It's not the worst stealing of a bike that ever was.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.120
No, it's not like you chopped the lock

21:25.120 --> 21:28.280
and took a little kid's huffy, but it's not great.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.600
God, I would love to have been there

21:29.600 --> 21:33.160
when you finally broke and just did the damn dirty thing.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.360
Can you imagine where you have to be at,

21:35.360 --> 21:38.360
just like, okay, fuck it, I'm just gonna do it.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.080
Just like you had to stick your courage

21:40.080 --> 21:42.120
to the sticking place and just like walk

21:42.120 --> 21:44.880
down your driveway and just like grab it.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.140
Like, am I really doing this?

21:46.140 --> 21:47.560
Am I really, I bet it was so exciting.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.400
I bet you were thrilled.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.680
Like, am I really stealing this bike?

21:49.680 --> 21:51.240
Oh my God, I'm stealing this bike.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.080
I'm doing this.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.400
I bet they did it slow at first,

21:53.400 --> 21:55.680
like they probably eased up and acted like

21:55.680 --> 21:56.520
they weren't taking it.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.760
They were just like dusting off.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.240
And yelled, and yelled like, I'm taking this bike now.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.440
I hope nobody stops me.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.280
You're lucky as shit that you weren't bait by, oh yeah.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.200
John Keenanus was across the street in a car.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.400
Detective John Keenanus.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.080
It was an episode of What Would You Do?

22:15.080 --> 22:17.400
And you just lost the morality test.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.240
I will say it is impressive that no one

22:19.240 --> 22:20.080
just stole it.

22:20.080 --> 22:20.920
Yeah.

22:20.920 --> 22:21.740
I mean, someone did.

22:21.740 --> 22:22.580
Someone did.

22:22.580 --> 22:23.420
Steal it.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.760
That person was the you.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.040
I would love a followup where John Keenanus

22:28.040 --> 22:31.800
does join a police force and becomes Detective John Keenanus

22:31.800 --> 22:34.360
in a sequel show called What Did You Do?

22:34.360 --> 22:37.520
And he just busts people for crime.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.660
He's like, I've got a special TV segment.

22:39.660 --> 22:42.140
You stole the bicycle and we've been filming it

22:42.140 --> 22:43.080
for three days.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.600
Oh, well, yeah, I guess you got me.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.440
I guess I learned my lesson.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.320
You sure did.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.160
You have the right to fucking remain silent.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.560
I'm Detective John Keenanus.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.020
No second chances.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.180
That's the third.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.020
That's the kind of man I am.

22:55.020 --> 22:56.120
That's the kind of man I am.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.680
No more you took the bike fever.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.840
You stole it.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.680
You did.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.580
You did steal it.

23:04.580 --> 23:07.080
Okay, break it down into its base components.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.320
There was a thing that was not yours.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.160
Yes.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.080
And you made it yours.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.360
By way of your taking of it.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.720
Without paying for it or even asking

23:15.720 --> 23:17.040
for permission of a thing.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.000
Yes.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
That's stealing.

23:19.000 --> 23:19.920
That's, and I don't-

23:19.920 --> 23:22.240
I've just described stealing.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.040
I mean, let's be honest.

23:24.040 --> 23:28.080
That bike was probably stolen from someone else, right?

23:28.080 --> 23:28.920
Every bike has been stolen.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.400
I'm gonna go back to Austin and open up my garage

23:31.400 --> 23:32.680
and both of my bikes are gone.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.280
So like all bikes are stolen.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.120
Yeah.

23:35.120 --> 23:35.940
Basically.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.080
I think someone stole this and then like,

23:37.080 --> 23:41.040
maybe they lost their nerve or saw a cop or something.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.480
Yeah, maybe it's cursed.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.500
It could be a curse.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.160
It could be one of those Jumanji bikes.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.120
Could be a Jumanji bike.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.200
And now you're what, riding it around?

23:48.200 --> 23:50.640
Okay, listen, question asker, here's my question for you.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.000
You take your hot bike,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.760
you're riding your hot bike around the neighborhood

23:53.760 --> 23:56.900
and somebody goes, hey, I think that's my bike.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.300
How do you respond?

23:58.300 --> 24:00.880
Because that's going to color like the rest of my,

24:00.880 --> 24:04.480
if you're like, oh, it was sitting in front of my house.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.300
And you question asker,

24:06.300 --> 24:07.920
the fact that your mind is racing right now

24:07.920 --> 24:09.680
to think about ways to prevent this,

24:09.680 --> 24:12.240
that the proof is in the pudding right there.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.080
I mean, you stole the bike.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.400
I'm worried that now,

24:14.400 --> 24:16.460
after the thrill of stealing a bike has happened,

24:16.460 --> 24:20.120
that you're now going to crave that high again.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.760
And like, I don't know that,

24:21.760 --> 24:25.040
I don't know that any bike is safe around you now, you know?

24:25.040 --> 24:27.800
And then pretty soon it'll be a velocipede, you know?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.240
There's only one circumstance

24:30.240 --> 24:32.180
in which you find a bike in the wild

24:32.180 --> 24:33.160
and you can make it yours.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.280
And I think it's if you fish it out of the river.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.600
Yeah. If you go fishing,

24:36.600 --> 24:37.860
and this is why most people fish,

24:37.860 --> 24:40.000
like it's not to fish, it's fucking boring.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.920
They're all hoping to get a bike.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.960
Well, because that's not stealing,

24:42.960 --> 24:43.920
that's rescuing a bike.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.480
You saved a bike at that point.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.080
And it's good for the environment.

24:47.080 --> 24:47.920
Yeah.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.320
I want to suggest sort of middle ground

24:50.320 --> 24:51.280
and see how it grabs you guys.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.120
Okay.

24:52.120 --> 24:57.040
What if you take the bike and ride it as your own,

24:57.040 --> 25:00.040
but every night when you're done with the bike,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.720
you return it to the sidewalk

25:01.720 --> 25:03.120
and leave it standing there just where you found it.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.120
For somebody that steal a bike,

25:05.120 --> 25:06.520
don't have a bike, steal a bike,

25:06.520 --> 25:08.200
have a bike, give it to be stole the bike.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.840
No, I'm saying you like,

25:10.840 --> 25:13.080
don't try to break this wild bike.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.040
Don't try to like make it yours.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.560
I'm saying like, leave it as a wild bike

25:17.560 --> 25:20.280
that when you need a bike, it's there for you.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.320
It's a community bike, but you ride it,

25:23.320 --> 25:25.320
but you don't try to take possession of it.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.160
You just use it when you need it.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.760
And if it's no longer there at some point, oh well.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.040
That bike's moved on to its next purpose.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.880
Because what are you doing by taking it?

25:33.880 --> 25:34.800
Here's what you're really,

25:34.800 --> 25:38.020
like let's put a pin in it.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.160
When you take it, what you're saying is,

25:40.160 --> 25:42.280
I hope no one else steals, this is for I do.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.120
Yeah.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.360
That's all you're doing is like,

25:44.360 --> 25:46.880
I'm gonna pre-steal this so no one steals it

25:46.880 --> 25:49.240
from the imagined possession that I've graded around it.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.320
The only thing you can do now

25:50.320 --> 25:52.080
is go throw it in the river

25:52.080 --> 25:53.600
for some lucky fishermen to find.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.620
And maybe leave a note on it that's just like,

25:55.620 --> 25:57.800
this bike is not cursed or like, which bike?

25:57.800 --> 25:59.600
And write on the note, serendipity.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.080
Because I saw the movie a long time ago.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.840
Well, you duct taped a DVD of serendipity to the bike.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.560
Do they, if they throw the bike in

26:06.560 --> 26:09.200
and then catch it themselves, is that then,

26:09.200 --> 26:10.320
is it like baptism?

26:10.320 --> 26:12.680
Is it then like, but they can't do it in the same,

26:12.680 --> 26:14.160
it has to come back around to them.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.280
They can't do it in the same event.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.560
Through all the worlds.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.380
Yeah. Okay.

26:17.380 --> 26:20.280
Because also, the experiences that bike has had

26:20.280 --> 26:21.960
will make it a fuller, richer bike.

26:21.960 --> 26:22.800
You know what I mean?

26:22.800 --> 26:24.680
If that bike is truly lived, you know?

26:24.680 --> 26:26.840
Guys, I miss my bike.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.840
I can't wait to get home and put some laps on it.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.660
I miss my bike.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.720
I can't wait to get home and tune her up.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.520
Yeah, assuming it's still there.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.080
Oh, it won't be, but if it is,

26:37.080 --> 26:38.980
I'm gonna grease the chains and pump those wheels

26:38.980 --> 26:39.820
and just tune her up.

26:39.820 --> 26:41.040
Have you ever had a bike stolen from you?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.640
Yeah, I had one stolen when I was a kid.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.720
I had one stolen.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.560
Grivance?

26:44.560 --> 26:45.380
No, I'm due.

26:45.380 --> 26:46.220
I'm due for it.

26:46.220 --> 26:49.120
Mine was on the porch of the Fine Arts Building in Oklahoma

26:49.120 --> 26:52.720
and my lock was broken on my U-bolt lock thing.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.680
So I just kind of draped it around so it looked locked.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.000
I was inside the building for about 20, 30 minutes

26:58.000 --> 26:59.360
and came back out and it was gone.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.420
And there was shrubbery and foliage all around the porch.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.720
So someone had to walk up and check and test every bike

27:05.720 --> 27:10.080
to steal my $80 Walmart bike.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.320
No, I've never had a bike stolen,

27:11.320 --> 27:13.160
but when I flew here for the TV show,

27:13.160 --> 27:16.040
I left my bike and the front tire's a little beat up,

27:16.040 --> 27:17.320
but I left it outside of somebody's house

27:17.320 --> 27:18.520
and I just put the kickstand down.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.460
I didn't lock it because Austin's a pretty friendly place.

27:20.460 --> 27:23.320
So I left it there and I'm sure it'll be,

27:23.320 --> 27:24.720
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.960
Someone's negligence is not an excuse

27:26.960 --> 27:28.160
to steal things from them.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.300
Yes, that's right.

27:29.300 --> 27:30.820
They accidentally left their bike there.

27:30.820 --> 27:32.560
Maybe they needed to run in some place real quick

27:32.560 --> 27:33.960
and it took them longer than they thought it would.

27:33.960 --> 27:34.800
Three days.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.640
Yeah.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.460
Three days longer than they thought it would.

27:36.460 --> 27:38.520
They had to just run into that puzzle dungeon real quick.

27:38.520 --> 27:39.340
Yeah.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.560
Should we go to the money tone?

27:41.560 --> 27:42.380
Yeah, let's go.

27:42.380 --> 27:43.640
Wee!

27:43.640 --> 27:45.320
I'm gonna need money to buy a new bike

27:45.320 --> 27:46.440
because mine's in hell.

27:46.440 --> 27:51.440
So our first sponsor this week is Blue Apron.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.100
If you have been looking to maybe expand

28:05.100 --> 28:08.420
your cooking prowess, but you don't know where to start,

28:08.420 --> 28:09.640
it can be pretty intimidating,

28:09.640 --> 28:12.140
but Blue Apron makes it really easy.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.600
They're gonna deliver you a box

28:13.600 --> 28:17.560
with all the food you need, fresh summer vegetables,

28:17.560 --> 28:20.600
fresh, you know, great produce, great meats,

28:20.600 --> 28:22.400
and step-by-step instructions with pictures

28:22.400 --> 28:27.400
that'll let you create delicious home-cooked meals

28:27.480 --> 28:30.440
with perfectly pre-proportioned, pre-proportioned?

28:30.440 --> 28:32.520
I have a lot of trouble with that one every time.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.360
Pre-proportioned ingredients?

28:33.360 --> 28:36.120
Hey, Blue Apron, you make an incredible product

28:36.120 --> 28:38.480
and your liner notes here that we're supposed to read

28:38.480 --> 28:40.960
are pretty good, but I think we need to just come up

28:40.960 --> 28:43.440
with a different word, because we just goof that one hard

28:43.440 --> 28:44.720
each time.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.720
And this is for less than $10 a meal, which is pretty great.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.520
They've got variety, new recipes are created weekly

28:50.520 --> 28:52.620
and are not repeated within a year.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.100
You can customize what you want based on your preferences.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.640
If you have, you know, dietary things

28:58.640 --> 29:00.000
that you're trying to stick to,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.960
Blue Apron can accommodate that.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.800
And it's easy and fun.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.920
Some meals that are coming down the pike in September,

29:05.920 --> 29:08.120
paprika, spiced shrimp, and cheddar grits

29:08.120 --> 29:10.920
with tomato and sweet corn, delicious.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.880
Spicy hoisin, there's your ASMR, everyone.

29:12.880 --> 29:13.720
Spicy hoisin.

29:13.720 --> 29:14.780
Or they just threw up.

29:14.780 --> 29:15.620
Chicken.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.000
That's the mouth sound Griffin made was not.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.640
That's how I, this is how, this is how I,

29:18.640 --> 29:20.760
so I have different ways of eating each kind of food.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.240
So the way that I did shrimp and grits was.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.080
So keep, read the next one and I'll tell you how you got.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.480
Spicy hoisin chicken stir fry with baby bok choy

29:29.480 --> 29:31.060
and sesame ginger cucumber salad.

29:31.060 --> 29:31.900
I love.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.720
So that one, I do big bites, big animated bites on that one.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.400
That sounds like a Sesame Street character

29:39.400 --> 29:42.320
eating a transition into the next scene, like a monster.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.340
What's the next one?

29:43.340 --> 29:44.320
I'm not doing any more.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.640
Eggplant and chickpea, chickpea tag to gene.

29:47.640 --> 29:50.640
Fuck, we gotta learn how to say this word, fellas.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.720
Anyway, that one's like.

29:51.720 --> 29:55.360
And I do like a bunch of really quick little bites.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.200
Right.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.020
Check out this week's menu

29:57.020 --> 29:59.740
and get your first three meals for free with free shipping

29:59.740 --> 30:02.000
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.780
You'll love how good it feels and tastes

30:03.780 --> 30:05.880
to create incredible home cooked meals with Blue Apron.

30:05.880 --> 30:06.720
So don't wait.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.480
Blueapron.com slash my brother.

30:09.480 --> 30:10.320
What is that?

30:10.320 --> 30:12.160
Kind of like bad corn.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.360
Little bites, just little bites.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.600
Little bites.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.800
Can I tell you about Squarespace?

30:15.800 --> 30:16.640
Wait.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.820
I would like to tell you about Squarespace, please,

30:19.820 --> 30:21.600
for once, can I just?

30:21.600 --> 30:23.760
We never let Travis tell us about Squarespace.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.080
Can I just, please?

30:25.080 --> 30:26.080
But if it makes you feel any better,

30:26.080 --> 30:28.320
it's because we think you're gonna do a really bad job.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.040
I'm not, I'm gonna do a good job.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.820
So, you know, websites, where do you get them, right?

30:33.820 --> 30:36.640
Like, it seems like everyone's got one

30:36.640 --> 30:40.320
and they're like, maybe it's a website all about like,

30:40.320 --> 30:41.680
I don't know, who vapes,

30:41.680 --> 30:44.400
or like the invasion of Normandy or something.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.960
I think you have to go to the store

30:47.960 --> 30:49.640
or maybe there's like a government place

30:49.640 --> 30:52.120
that you have to go to and ask them for a website

30:52.120 --> 30:52.960
and then they do one.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.400
You know what, I used to think that.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.240
Yeah.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.580
But no, you just go to squarespace.com.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.360
They've already got a bunch of websites

30:59.360 --> 31:01.040
that they'll just give you.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.320
I don't think it works that way.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.520
So they bought all the websites and then you go there

31:04.520 --> 31:06.440
and they're like, that'll be $5 for a website.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.480
And I say, okay.

31:07.480 --> 31:10.000
An old man leads you down a dusty corridor

31:10.000 --> 31:11.480
and he asks you some questions

31:11.480 --> 31:13.400
about the kind of person you are.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.200
And then he just reaches up and selects a website.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.040
He grabs.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.800
This one will do nicely.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.960
Grabs an old Mason jar full of websites

31:20.960 --> 31:21.960
and he unscrews the lid

31:21.960 --> 31:23.960
and upends the websites out onto the table

31:23.960 --> 31:24.980
and you get to pick the one you want.

31:24.980 --> 31:28.200
He said, well, no, it couldn't be.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.840
I've had this one here for years.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.720
Certainly not.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.760
Only one dark wizard has claimed this website before.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.100
It doesn't work like this at all,

31:36.100 --> 31:37.660
but it is very easy.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.320
Travis, our prediction of you doing a bad job

31:40.320 --> 31:42.520
like Swing Squarespace has been prescient.

31:42.520 --> 31:46.540
Voldemort also has a website that uses Ruby.

31:46.540 --> 31:48.160
I thought I was actually doing a pretty good job

31:48.160 --> 31:49.920
till you got started on this old man tangent.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.440
Well, no, this is the important thing about commercials

31:52.440 --> 31:54.940
is to not let the other two brothers assail.

31:54.940 --> 31:55.780
Yeah.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.280
Stand your ground.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.240
Let me run through it.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.800
So Squarespace will teach you

32:00.800 --> 32:02.420
and show you everything you need to know

32:02.420 --> 32:04.040
to build a pretty amazing website.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.880
I mean, macroshows.com on Squarespace.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.360
It took me about 30 minutes.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.000
How much did you have to pay the old man

32:09.000 --> 32:11.600
at the store for macroshows?

32:11.600 --> 32:13.560
I don't remember, but it was very reasonable.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.000
It was a very low amount.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Does he deal in trades?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.400
No, but with every website,

32:19.400 --> 32:21.400
you do get one Werther's original,

32:21.400 --> 32:22.640
still warm from his pocket.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.520
Travis, you are letting us walk all over you.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.360
Let me tell you about the features.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.380
It's easy.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.200
You get a free custom domain.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.520
They got beautiful templates, seamless commerce tools.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.360
So if you want to make money off your website,

32:35.360 --> 32:36.200
you can do that.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.920
Now, how did you fold the commerce tools into McElroy Shows?

32:38.920 --> 32:41.240
Every time you click a link on macroshows.com,

32:41.240 --> 32:43.080
you get charged $5.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.600
What does the website man get?

32:45.600 --> 32:47.880
The website man gets 4.99 of it.

32:47.880 --> 32:48.720
That's a lot for the-

32:48.720 --> 32:52.320
I get one penny, but I'm literally doing no work.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.720
The website man doesn't,

32:53.720 --> 32:55.180
he dresses very poorly.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.440
And you would think,

32:56.440 --> 32:59.040
with all the money he's making from the website residuals-

32:59.040 --> 33:00.000
He's very invested.

33:00.000 --> 33:00.840
He has a very diverse portfolio.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.600
You are a fucking doormat right now.

The perfect advertisement for our website service.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.920
You know that openly hostile sound you've been looking for?

33:46.920 --> 33:48.360
Listen to this.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.380
Got a personal message here.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.300
Jumbotron message for Anthony,

33:51.300 --> 33:54.060
soon to be Le Mou, Le Mou.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.720
Le Mou?

33:55.720 --> 33:58.680
And it's from Allison, soon to be Le Mou.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.680
Ha.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.680
Who says, I love you more than Griffin loves horses.

34:02.680 --> 34:03.980
False.

34:03.980 --> 34:05.040
Travis loves dogs.

34:05.040 --> 34:05.880
Impossible.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.160
And Justin loves not having to say big words in Jumbotrons.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.000
Correct.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.120
I can't wait to marry you on Saturday

34:12.120 --> 34:13.280
and spend the rest of our lives

34:13.280 --> 34:15.020
listening to the brothers together.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.720
I love you so much, Burbles.

34:16.720 --> 34:19.080
You can hit me up on my mobile anytime.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.920
Oh, this wedding's actually happening this week.

34:20.920 --> 34:21.760
We crushed it.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.200
We stuck the landing on the date, folks.

34:24.200 --> 34:27.920
October 1st is when Anthony and Allison are getting married.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.440
Congratulations, you two are very excited.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.440
Hope everything goes well.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.280
I'm sure it will.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.360
And enjoy your new life together.

34:34.360 --> 34:38.760
I got a message for I-Tay, that's Allison Taylor,

34:38.760 --> 34:42.340
from Beelife, which is Blythe.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.800
Who is Blythe?

34:43.800 --> 34:46.360
Hey, happy birthday to you, I-Tay.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.340
Thank you for introducing me

34:47.340 --> 34:49.160
to the magical world of Bim Bam,

34:49.160 --> 34:52.480
biking and all things majestic.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.300
Cheers to all the bike riders and Mario, no, sorry.

34:55.300 --> 34:58.560
Hey, bike riders, thanks for listening to my message.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.680
Hey, hey, got a second bike riders.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.120
This one goes out to all the biker people out there.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.280
This goes to all the bike thieves out there.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.160
Take another run at this,

35:09.160 --> 35:11.680
read the rest of the fucking message.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.180
Thank you for introducing me

35:13.180 --> 35:14.380
to the magical world of Bim Bam,

35:14.380 --> 35:16.840
biking and all things majestic.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.620
Cheers to all the bike rides and Mario Kart times

35:19.620 --> 35:20.460
that are ahead.

35:20.460 --> 35:24.840
Also, happy birthday for like four years, girl.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.920
This one's for June.

35:26.920 --> 35:27.760
Didn't quite.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.400
So I wanged it just a little bit.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.240
Didn't quite get there.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.880
I feel like that you introduced,

35:31.880 --> 35:33.800
if I can double check this again,

35:33.800 --> 35:36.160
you were introduced by your friend

35:36.160 --> 35:38.240
to my brother, my brother, me,

35:38.240 --> 35:40.320
and the concept of biking.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.720
Yeah, it's tight, dude.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.560
You know cars?

35:42.560 --> 35:44.200
Imagine half of that.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.760
Hey, look what I stole for you.

35:45.760 --> 35:46.600
Look what I stole for you.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.200
It's like a car, but half of that and the engine is you.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.920
I would love to be in Blythe's childhood home

35:51.920 --> 35:55.240
when she sees kids outside moving quickly past the window

35:55.240 --> 35:58.960
on some kind of wonderful metal monster.

35:58.960 --> 36:02.240
If you're on a bike, you're the engine

36:02.240 --> 36:05.100
and all the food you ate that day is the fuel.

36:05.100 --> 36:05.940
Think about it.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.280
So you could go to Taco Bell and be like,

36:08.280 --> 36:11.360
I'm at the gas station for the me engine.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.200
If you think about it.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.920
Give me some bike fuel and a tostada.

36:13.920 --> 36:14.760
Can I get a bike?

36:14.760 --> 36:16.740
Can I get a Crunchwrap bike fuel?

36:19.240 --> 36:20.160
I'm Barbara Gray.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.000
I'm Brandi Posey.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.040
And I'm Tess Barker.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.120
We're Lady2Lady.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.760
Do you want a sleepover in your ears?

36:24.760 --> 36:25.880
Is that a friend in your pocket

36:25.880 --> 36:27.800
or are you just podcast to see me?

36:27.800 --> 36:28.760
We're a portable hangout.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.840
You can bring to the gym on the subway or on an oil rig.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.680
Seriously, we have listeners who do that.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.480
Chill with us while we get high with Margaret Cho.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.440
Talk showgirls with Katya from Drag Race.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.240
And hear Broadway star Anthony Rapp sing Hamilton.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.880
I am not throwing away my shot.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.280
I am not throwing away my shot.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.600
Hey yo, I'm just like my country.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.800
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry

36:47.800 --> 36:50.160
and I'm not throwing away my shot.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.240
That's Lady2Lady.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.240
Can you keep a secret?

36:52.240 --> 36:53.460
Neither can we.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.240
You guys want a Yahoo?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.440
You know what Griffin, I would.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.680
How about this one sent in by

37:01.680 --> 37:04.440
level 9000 Yahoo Juju Juju Juju Juju.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.080
It's from Yahoo Answers user 420.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.920
Nice.

37:08.920 --> 37:09.760
Who asks?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.060
That's not one that got removed.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.180
No. Amazing.

37:13.560 --> 37:17.160
And it's in pets horses asks,

37:17.160 --> 37:19.520
have you met or seen any celebrities

37:19.520 --> 37:21.720
through the horse world?

37:21.720 --> 37:23.320
Which is of course,

37:23.320 --> 37:27.440
if you look at a mirror during the dark hour,

37:27.440 --> 37:29.120
You can see into the horse world.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.800
You can peer through the Equestriaverse.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.880
You can peer into the Equestriaverse

37:32.880 --> 37:34.640
and its secrets will be revealed.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.520
I'm just wondering if anyone else has,

37:36.520 --> 37:41.520
I've seen Patrick Swayze, so this one's from a minute ago.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.000
I've seen Patrick Swayze at the, unless, oh my God.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.660
Swayze's in the Equestriaverse.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.460
Is that where he went?

37:49.460 --> 37:51.640
We've gotta get him out of there.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.600
Gotta get him out, DD2's gotta happen.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.880
Actually, you know what?

37:54.880 --> 37:56.520
DD2 did happen, by the way.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.160
Wait, wait, DD2. It's called Havana Nights.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.560
Yeah, DD3.

37:59.560 --> 38:00.400
Yep. Yeah.

38:00.400 --> 38:03.960
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.080
I've seen Swayze at the Kentucky Horse Park before

38:07.080 --> 38:10.240
and in WEF, that's the Winter Equestrian Festival,

38:10.240 --> 38:13.200
in Florida, Seinfeld was there because his daughter rides

38:13.200 --> 38:14.360
and I talked to him.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.360
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.620
Here's what I said.

38:18.620 --> 38:19.460
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

38:19.460 --> 38:22.320
Mary Kate Olsen tried my friend's horse the other week.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.440
Let me, let me try your horse.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.000
It is mine now.

38:26.000 --> 38:26.880
So we get to talk to her

38:26.880 --> 38:29.040
and I shook Steven Spielberg's hand.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.200
His daughter was in my junior hunter class.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.760
That's for hunting horses.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.600
The horse world.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.440
Wait, wait, wait.

38:34.440 --> 38:35.680
Like you see him out in the wild like,

38:35.680 --> 38:37.240
shh, shh, shh, I got a shot.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.720
No, you don't kill the horses.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.520
You ride the horses into the hunt.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.960
It's just you and the horse killing

38:42.960 --> 38:44.760
much smaller defenseless animals.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.960
I just think it's cool that celebs compete

38:46.960 --> 38:49.160
in the same sport I do and when they're in the horse world,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.600
they're still viewed as celebrities,

38:50.600 --> 38:52.140
but people generally leave them alone

38:52.140 --> 38:53.780
like they're normal people showing.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.160
No paparazzi or anything scattering.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.880
Ah, a blessy.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.020
Oh, thank you.

38:59.020 --> 39:01.680
No paparazzi or anything annoying scattering to them

39:01.680 --> 39:03.380
or to talk or greet them.

39:03.380 --> 39:04.920
It's just interesting.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.160
Do you have any celeb stories that relate to horses?

39:07.160 --> 39:08.420
Cher!

39:08.420 --> 39:09.260
I love to hear them.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.080
Oh, Cher?

39:10.080 --> 39:11.520
Yeah, she loves riding horses.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.360
Cher me those.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.720
Cher, Cher, nice horse!

39:14.720 --> 39:16.000
Hey, Cher!

39:16.000 --> 39:20.320
This person, through being a part of the horse world,

39:20.320 --> 39:23.000
has met Seinfeld Spielberg.

39:23.000 --> 39:23.840
Yes.

39:23.840 --> 39:24.660
Married Kate.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.040
Uh-huh.

39:26.040 --> 39:26.880
Suaz.

39:26.880 --> 39:31.880
Suaz, Suaze, and like everybody's just totally chill.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.440
Yeah, everybody's totally chill with that.

39:33.440 --> 39:36.280
I'm saying that the horse world is fucking star-studded.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.440
Do you know who loves horses?

39:37.440 --> 39:38.280
Who?

39:38.280 --> 39:39.120
I'll give you two people who love horses.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.200
Please tell me now.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.120
Martha Stewart.

39:41.120 --> 39:41.960
Okay.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.780
Crazy about them.

39:42.780 --> 39:43.620
Channing Tatum.

39:43.620 --> 39:44.460
Yes, very much so.

39:44.460 --> 39:45.280
Crazy for horses.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.120
That makes perfect sense.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.040
Goes crazy for them.

39:47.040 --> 39:47.880
He's got his own.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.720
He's gone riding with Martha Stewart.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.320
I know this from Baby Geniuses.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.360
They do a whole segment called Band Challenge

39:53.360 --> 39:55.520
about Martha Stewart's pony, Band Challenge.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.300
Hunter Jumper says,

39:57.300 --> 40:00.600
I've never met anyone at a horse show, frown face, but.

40:00.600 --> 40:04.400
Never, and I mean, I've never met anyone at a horse show.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.000
But Bill Gates used to work with my dad

40:07.000 --> 40:08.400
and would come speak at his meetings.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.280
Same with Steve Jobs.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.840
My friend was in the Justin Bieber movie

40:10.840 --> 40:13.140
and a close family friend has worked with Channing Tatum.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.240
My family also goes to the TED conferences every year.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.080
We meet a lot of people there.

40:16.080 --> 40:16.920
Hold on!

40:16.920 --> 40:17.740
Hold the fucking phone!

40:17.740 --> 40:20.080
That's not what we asked!

40:20.080 --> 40:22.720
It's not, have you ever met anyone, period.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.240
That's a really acceptable diversion.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.200
Justin, have you ever met anybody at the horse thing?

40:26.200 --> 40:28.000
Well, no, but I saw Dave Chappelle

40:28.000 --> 40:29.480
on the street in New York once.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.320
So that was cool.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.160
So that was cool.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.000
Also, my dad is Steve Jobs, so fuck you.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.200
My dad hangs out with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, or did.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.040
Did, yeah.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.920
We've just lost a lot of people since September 4th, 2009.

40:43.480 --> 40:47.080
Have you guys ever met anyone through the horse world?

40:47.080 --> 40:51.080
Have I met anyone through the horse world?

40:51.080 --> 40:52.280
So one time during the dark hour,

40:52.280 --> 40:54.520
I did look into the mirror during,

40:54.520 --> 40:55.820
it was a thunderstorm outside,

40:55.820 --> 40:59.540
and I looked into the mirror

40:59.540 --> 41:04.540
and Wanda Sykes was on the other side.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.400
Wow!

41:05.400 --> 41:06.640
Yeah, Wanda Sykes was looking.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.240
She was also, during the dark hour,

41:08.240 --> 41:10.440
was looking into the mirror through the Equestriaverse.

41:10.440 --> 41:15.040
And it was hard to see her through all the billowing mains

41:15.040 --> 41:17.120
and just sort of like dust clouds being kicked up

41:17.120 --> 41:19.560
while these Mustangs just sort of ran through.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.520
But yeah, we definitely saw, and I waved and she waved.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.960
She looked a little bit uncomfortable, but it was nice.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.680
Did she have a prophetic message for you?

41:25.680 --> 41:26.880
Because I've heard if you look in the mirror

41:26.880 --> 41:29.160
in the dark hour and you see Wanda Sykes

41:29.160 --> 41:31.740
in the horse world, she'll tell you something

41:31.740 --> 41:33.600
that you wish you didn't know about your future.

41:33.600 --> 41:37.040
I mean, any communication was sort of,

41:37.040 --> 41:40.500
language gets destroyed in the horse world.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.520
So it's really, it's tough.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.200
It was just Wanda Sykes screaming.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.400
It was Wanda Sykes, and she was screaming something.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.440
And I was trying to read her lips,

41:47.440 --> 41:48.840
but there were so many horses.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.840
That's the worst part, she was screaming a date.

41:51.840 --> 41:52.680
Just over and over.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.500
And she actually reached out

41:53.500 --> 41:54.880
and she wrote something on a notepad.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.000
And as soon as she held it up, her mirror shattered

41:57.000 --> 41:58.560
and she was actually lost to the horse world.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.360
Oh, I hate to see that.

42:00.360 --> 42:01.960
You hate that when that happens.

42:01.960 --> 42:04.520
I've never met anybody specifically

42:04.520 --> 42:06.740
through the horse world, but when I was in Scotland,

42:06.740 --> 42:09.240
Theresa and I did go on a horseback ride through the Glen

42:09.240 --> 42:10.480
and I rode a horse.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.320
And I-

42:11.320 --> 42:12.160
What was the horse's name?

42:12.160 --> 42:13.060
I can't remember the horse's name,

42:13.060 --> 42:15.680
but I swear it was, it was in,

42:15.680 --> 42:17.200
I don't know if it was like a spiritual thing

42:17.200 --> 42:18.040
or just like a spiritual successor thing.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.680
Oh, it was a spiritual thing, definitely.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.420
Because the horse was Napoleon Bonaparte.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.260
I can tell- Oh, shit.

42:23.260 --> 42:24.840
I can tell by the way the horse shit.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.160
Like, it shit, it was very, like, defiant and powerful.

42:28.160 --> 42:31.440
Napoleon, small man, huge craps.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.760
And he would do it right in the middle of the ground,

42:34.760 --> 42:37.280
staring at, like, staring into the eyes

42:37.280 --> 42:39.880
of his, like, officers to, like, show dominance.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.560
And he would only do it once a week

42:41.560 --> 42:42.880
because he wanted to get a really good one.

42:42.880 --> 42:43.720
And he'd be like,

42:43.720 --> 42:45.720
Zutolo, it's time for the mega craps!

42:45.720 --> 42:46.560
And it would actually, like,

42:46.560 --> 42:47.960
kind of lift him off the ground a little bit.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.800
Yeah, it was like a fun cartoon dookie.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.400
And that's exactly what this horse did.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.320
And I was like, oh my God.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.880
Do you think, you know, like,

42:52.880 --> 42:54.360
you see those sedans that have, like,

42:54.360 --> 42:55.400
four people carrying it?

42:55.400 --> 42:57.720
Like, don't you think that, as it's this way,

42:57.720 --> 42:59.120
dominance, those should all have holes

42:59.120 --> 43:00.280
in the bottom to shit out of them?

43:00.280 --> 43:01.120
Yeah.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.120
Because, like, what could be more, like,

43:02.120 --> 43:04.560
there's one thing cooler than being carried by four people

43:04.560 --> 43:06.760
and it's like, I'm actually gonna take a dump right now.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.920
Sorry.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.440
Please try to keep it steady.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.480
How about another question?

43:10.480 --> 43:13.120
I wanna get in the horse world.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.680
Do you have to pay your way in?

43:14.680 --> 43:15.920
I mean, yes.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.800
Do you have to own a horse?

43:17.800 --> 43:18.620
Yeah.

43:18.620 --> 43:19.460
That probably helps.

43:19.460 --> 43:20.520
They probably don't want any looky-loos

43:20.520 --> 43:22.720
that are just like, I don't have a horse,

43:22.720 --> 43:24.040
but I'm super into them.

43:24.040 --> 43:24.860
Yeah.

43:24.860 --> 43:25.880
You're just a poseur.

43:25.880 --> 43:26.920
You're a casual.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.440
Hit me with a cue, y'all.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.280
Here it comes.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.520
I was eating the cookie after lunch,

43:31.520 --> 43:33.000
before going to the, I want a munch!

43:33.000 --> 43:33.840
Squad!

43:33.840 --> 43:34.660
Squad!

43:34.660 --> 43:35.500
No, you fucked it up.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.340
I got it.

43:36.340 --> 43:38.520
That was a good time that you did it very well.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.360
Thank you.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.400
I want a munch!

43:40.400 --> 43:41.240
Squad!

43:41.240 --> 43:43.120
Am I supposed to sing it?

43:43.120 --> 43:45.240
I want a munch!

43:45.240 --> 43:46.080
Squad!

43:46.080 --> 43:48.640
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.800
The hut's back.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.720
I don't know, has the hut been up in the squad before?

43:52.720 --> 43:54.920
The hut is sticking cheese and hot dogs

43:54.920 --> 43:55.740
and fucking everything,

43:55.740 --> 43:57.920
so yeah, I'm assuming they've been in the mix.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.080
Here's the literal title of this press release.

44:00.080 --> 44:00.920
Give it to me.

44:00.920 --> 44:02.560
This is not a drill.

44:02.560 --> 44:05.400
Jesus God, no, it's happening for real!

44:05.400 --> 44:08.340
Pizza Hut unleashes latest cheesy goodness

44:08.340 --> 44:11.160
in all new grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.100
What the fuck did I tell you?

44:12.100 --> 44:14.800
Pizza Hut embarrassing us with cheese.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.200
Okay, here's the beginning of the press release.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.560
We like to refer to press releases here on the Munch Squad

44:20.560 --> 44:22.080
because who better to talk about this stuff

44:22.080 --> 44:23.200
than the experts?

44:23.200 --> 44:24.900
Justin, wait, before you jump into it really quick,

44:24.900 --> 44:25.840
and this is important,

44:25.840 --> 44:26.980
this is like a drill, right?

44:26.980 --> 44:27.820
This is like a-

44:27.820 --> 44:29.480
No, this is not a drill.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.320
This is like a practice run.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.120
Grilled cheese, good.

44:33.120 --> 44:35.240
Original stuffed crust pizza, good.

44:35.240 --> 44:38.640
Grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza, real good.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.760
Nice, that's good copy right there.

44:40.760 --> 44:43.480
It features extra gooey cheddar

44:43.480 --> 44:48.480
and mozzarella cheese stuffed and baked onto the crust.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.520
Finish off the grilled cheese crust.

44:50.520 --> 44:53.080
It's topped with toasted breadcrumbs and melted butter.

44:53.080 --> 44:53.920
Excellent.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.200
Because that's been the problem with crusts

44:55.200 --> 44:56.160
to this point. More bread.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.720
It's just bread and butter.

44:57.720 --> 45:02.440
I just love the Hut's genuine cheese,

45:02.440 --> 45:05.720
like they're- It's all hand rolled.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.800
They use the sauce and the corks.

45:09.200 --> 45:12.320
My question is this, cheddar.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.560
Is there anything in there, Justin,

45:13.560 --> 45:15.640
that stipulates what separates this

45:15.640 --> 45:18.560
from a cheese stuffed crust pizza?

45:18.560 --> 45:21.520
I just fucking outline for you

45:21.520 --> 45:25.160
that includes hand rolled artisanal mozzarella.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.840
Is that the mozzarella?

45:26.840 --> 45:29.280
And toasted breadcrumbs and melted butter.

45:29.280 --> 45:30.600
Probably.

45:30.600 --> 45:34.760
The butter is probably what separates it from the herd.

45:34.760 --> 45:38.360
These motherfuckers put breadcrumbs up on the bread.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.040
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to throw in here.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.840
That's unacceptable, guys.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.520
It's impossible.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.880
Where did they get the crumbs from?

45:44.880 --> 45:47.400
They must have destroyed other bread.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.200
They must have taken whole bread

45:49.200 --> 45:51.720
to ruin it for other bread.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.200
Every pizza takes two pizzas to pizza

45:54.200 --> 45:57.040
and that's just, I'm an eco conservationist

45:57.040 --> 45:58.160
and that just sets me off.

45:58.160 --> 46:02.560
Here's a quote, perhaps the most unnecessary

46:02.560 --> 46:06.200
explanatory quote in American rhetoric.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.200
It's from David Tim, chief marketing officer of Pizza Hut,

46:09.200 --> 46:11.880
so you know he can be trusted.

46:11.880 --> 46:13.480
The grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza

46:13.480 --> 46:16.200
is the perfect combination of a classic grilled cheese

46:16.200 --> 46:17.400
and traditional pizza.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.240
Thanks, David.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.080
Thank you.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.960
I did wonder where you were going with this bad boy.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.320
You know what would be a way bolder statement?

46:23.320 --> 46:25.600
It's an imperfect comment.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.920
This hybrid should not and could not exist.

46:27.920 --> 46:28.760
Here's the truth.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.240
We've been working on this for two years

46:30.240 --> 46:31.680
and we just got to a point where it's like,

46:31.680 --> 46:33.480
we can't put any more R&D into this.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.240
We just have to release it in the wild.

46:35.240 --> 46:39.920
The result is a delicious, flavorful, and indulgent pizza

46:39.920 --> 46:43.040
that packs the punch of a gooey, cheesy, crunchy

46:43.040 --> 46:43.880
grilled cheese.

46:43.880 --> 46:44.720
Luxuriate.

46:44.720 --> 46:47.720
How much selling does it take to get the concept

46:47.720 --> 46:49.720
of the crust is like grilled cheese?

46:50.720 --> 46:52.680
I know what you're doing.

46:52.680 --> 46:56.000
And then it says, the result of eating this pizza

46:56.000 --> 46:58.920
will either be dumped forever or never dumped again

46:58.920 --> 47:00.640
or it's like unclear.

47:00.640 --> 47:02.520
Or like both, but alternating

47:02.520 --> 47:04.160
and you never know which one is going to be.

47:04.160 --> 47:08.920
Indulgent is maybe the best adjective

47:08.920 --> 47:12.680
because it's literally one shade below

47:12.680 --> 47:15.360
like gluttonous fuck pile.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.720
This is a real hedonistic pizza.

47:17.720 --> 47:18.720
Enjoy.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.080
Feed your corpulence.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.760
Bathe in olive oil and red wine as you enjoy it.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.720
Add this to your self-slime trash bag.

47:26.720 --> 47:30.520
Yeah, the perfect appetizer for a night at the vomitorium.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.840
Then have your servant come in

47:31.840 --> 47:33.840
and tickle your throat with her feathers

47:33.840 --> 47:35.360
so that thou must enjoy more pizza.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.720
Rub this on your face.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.760
You would think the press release would end there.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.800
But someone wrote all that stuff

47:42.800 --> 47:45.480
and was like, I still don't know if they get it.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.280
They say, this is how they justify cheese

47:48.280 --> 47:52.200
is rapidly becoming one of America's favorite foods.

47:52.200 --> 47:54.960
Dot cheese? Dot chase?

47:54.960 --> 47:56.600
It's 2016.

47:56.600 --> 48:01.600
Cheese has been a predominant part of cuisine forever.

48:02.420 --> 48:03.260
It continues.

48:03.260 --> 48:05.520
Related, pizza is often ranked

48:05.520 --> 48:07.560
as the most popular food in America.

48:07.560 --> 48:08.400
Get out.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.640
Pizza Hut puts that in every one of their press releases.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.600
Pizza, still very good.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.680
Still very, very good and popular.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.040
We did millions of dollars of research

48:17.040 --> 48:20.480
to determine that people seem to like cheese and pizza.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.520
And I'm reading here down on the press release, it says,

48:22.520 --> 48:24.920
fuck hamburgers, that's crazy.

48:24.920 --> 48:28.020
Then it continues to round out the equation.

48:28.020 --> 48:29.780
Grilled cheese has been pegged

48:29.780 --> 48:32.340
as one of the most comforting foods ever imagined.

48:32.340 --> 48:35.520
Now all these favorites, and there are quotes on that,

48:35.520 --> 48:37.760
favorites can be enjoyed as one.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.680
This is like the person that tells you a joke

48:39.680 --> 48:42.240
and it's like, no, the horse has a long face.

48:42.240 --> 48:46.120
So why the long face is because the horse has a long face.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.800
I'm gonna read the last paragraph here, okay?

48:49.800 --> 48:52.320
Because the fact that this is a paragraph

48:52.320 --> 48:54.720
as part of a press release going out to the press

48:54.720 --> 48:56.720
does just delight me.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.880
Is there a newspaper, by the way, of record

48:58.880 --> 49:00.720
that is like great quotes,

49:00.720 --> 49:03.520
definitely gonna toss these in our story, cheese.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.840
It's very important right now.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.080
Pizza on the rise.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.760
People like pizza and cheese and they like grilled cheese.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.400
It's not the presses.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.360
Steven with his front page.

49:14.360 --> 49:17.160
The grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza

49:17.160 --> 49:19.240
can be topped with any one of the following

49:19.240 --> 49:21.480
fresh Pizza Hut ingredients.

49:21.480 --> 49:24.560
Fresh mushrooms, fresh spinach, fresh red onions,

49:24.560 --> 49:26.880
fresh green bell peppers, sliced banana peppers,

49:26.880 --> 49:28.960
sweet pineapples, sliced jalapeno peppers,

49:28.960 --> 49:31.680
Mediterranean black olives, Peruvian cherry peppers,

49:31.680 --> 49:33.600
and diced roma tomatoes, as well as pepperoni,

49:33.600 --> 49:36.360
Italian sausage, premium salami, classic meatballs,

49:36.360 --> 49:39.320
slow Russian ham, hardwood smoked bacon,

49:39.320 --> 49:41.520
grilled chicken, beef, and seasoned pork.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.400
Pizza lovers can customize their pizza

49:43.400 --> 49:44.920
with a choice of five sauces,

49:44.920 --> 49:47.200
including classic marinara, premium crushed tomato,

49:47.200 --> 49:48.280
creamy garlic Parmesan.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.160
This is now a menu.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.240
Hey, your press release is now a menu.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.720
They can also top their pizza

49:52.720 --> 49:54.440
with a choice of sauce drizzles.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.080
This is just your menu, idiot.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.320
It's your menu, dummy, idiot, dumb asshole.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.520
You just put this in your press release.

49:59.520 --> 50:00.760
It's just your fucking menu.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.400
Are you fucking Charles Dickens working on a word count

50:03.400 --> 50:04.240
so you get paid by the law?

50:04.240 --> 50:06.720
The things you can put on the pizza is all the things

50:06.720 --> 50:08.160
because there's no pizza law.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.080
These are the prices.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.240
These are the prices and the different sizes

50:12.240 --> 50:15.000
and here's every phone number to every Pizza Hut.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.040
So please. You call, you'll talk to Bill.

50:17.040 --> 50:19.240
He'll walk you through the process from that point.

50:19.240 --> 50:21.040
Hey guys, this is a great press release.

50:21.040 --> 50:24.000
I was just wondering, my name is Dr. Salad

50:24.000 --> 50:25.600
and I was wondering if there's anything for me

50:25.600 --> 50:27.360
at your establishment.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.160
Mr. Domino's has been able to help me out lately

50:30.160 --> 50:32.480
so I'm not such a heel with my local parties.

50:32.480 --> 50:33.360
Go fuck yourself.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.120
Cheese is so popular right now.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.520
Unless we can put grilled cheese into a salad somehow.

50:37.520 --> 50:38.560
That's crazy. That's ludicrous.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.840
Also, can I just make one quick note?

50:40.840 --> 50:41.760
They try to sell you a line

50:41.760 --> 50:44.640
about how they'll make your crust a pretzel.

50:44.640 --> 50:46.000
Griffin and I specifically requested-

50:46.000 --> 50:46.840
Oh, what the fuck?

50:46.840 --> 50:47.720
I didn't even think about that.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.320
It's all I've thought about for three days.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.360
Griffin and I specifically requested a pretzel.

50:51.360 --> 50:54.200
After a long shoot, a long day of shooting

50:54.200 --> 50:59.200
and doing, oh, we had to eat late night pizza

50:59.200 --> 51:00.800
and we specifically asked for a pretzel crust

51:00.800 --> 51:01.640
and did we get it?

51:01.640 --> 51:02.460
We did not.

51:02.460 --> 51:03.300
We did not.

51:03.300 --> 51:04.680
But could you get, wait,

51:04.680 --> 51:07.600
could you get a grilled cheese crust that's pretzel?

51:07.600 --> 51:09.360
Yeah, we can get whatever the fuck we want.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.800
There's no pizza law.

51:10.800 --> 51:11.640
There's nothing left.

51:11.640 --> 51:12.720
No, I actually don't think that that would work.

51:12.720 --> 51:13.560
I don't think you could.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.040
Anyway, let me actually read the question.

51:17.040 --> 51:18.440
I was eating a cookie after lunch

51:18.440 --> 51:20.200
before going to the computer lab.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.120
When I got there, I realized there was a crumb

51:22.120 --> 51:24.500
from the cookie stuck in a fold in my shirt.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.840
Without thinking, I popped it straight into my mouth.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.640
Several people in the lab stared at me in shock,

51:30.640 --> 51:33.200
even though I explained it was just a cookie crumb.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.080
No, no, no, no.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.640
You don't understand.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.200
It was a crumb from a cookie.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.780
I was enjoying a delectable Otis punk wire

51:42.780 --> 51:45.360
and I just couldn't let a single morsel

51:45.360 --> 51:46.200
of that bad boy get away.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.520
Oh, there's some under my nails.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.440
Oh, you're scandalized,

51:50.440 --> 51:52.560
because perhaps I should have shared.

51:52.560 --> 51:56.320
Sorry, all the Otis spunkmire for me, unfortunately.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.960
What do you want to call your cookie company?

51:57.960 --> 51:59.520
Well, I have a pretty appetizing name.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.360
What is it?

52:00.360 --> 52:01.960
It's Otis spunkmire.

52:01.960 --> 52:06.960
I can't put it on things.

52:07.400 --> 52:08.520
Finish the question.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.920
Okay, should I just brush it off

52:10.920 --> 52:13.040
or was I okay not letting it go to waste?

52:13.040 --> 52:15.440
That's from Insatiable Appetite in Athens, Georgia.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.840
You were absolutely not okay.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.280
That is unacceptable.

52:18.280 --> 52:19.100
What is it?

52:19.100 --> 52:19.940
Oh, it's acceptable.

52:19.940 --> 52:21.600
Well, the problem is they did not clarify

52:21.600 --> 52:23.600
the size of said crumb.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.960
If you have a cookie crumb on your shirt

52:25.960 --> 52:30.000
that's a passenger on you, that's embarrassing.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.460
Eating it isn't, that is whatever.

52:32.460 --> 52:33.640
Why do you fucking care?

52:33.640 --> 52:37.040
I don't know the level of CSI bullshit

52:37.040 --> 52:39.520
you would need to go through to confirm 100%

52:39.520 --> 52:41.440
that it was definitely a delectable

52:41.440 --> 52:42.560
Otis spunkmire cookie crumb.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.120
Especially when you work,

52:44.120 --> 52:46.720
let me change the question again, in a lab.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.200
Yeah, you work in a lab.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.560
In a computer lab.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.280
It's not like you don't fucking science.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.120
They're not like dicing.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.400
I missed the word computer.

52:53.400 --> 52:54.220
They're like, oh man,

52:54.220 --> 52:56.560
we've almost finished splicing the genome.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.600
Oh no, I made the one that gives me wasp wings.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.280
But this is wee, that's how science works.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.800
That's how science works.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.120
Okay, other options though,

53:05.120 --> 53:06.440
like people were acting pretty upset,

53:06.440 --> 53:07.680
but what would they have thought

53:07.680 --> 53:09.560
if you picked a cookie, come off your shirt

53:09.560 --> 53:10.800
and just like flicked it at them?

53:10.800 --> 53:11.640
Like that would be bad.

53:11.640 --> 53:12.460
I think they probably would have thought

53:12.460 --> 53:13.880
you were a real like bad boy.

53:13.880 --> 53:14.720
What were you supposed to do?

53:14.720 --> 53:16.560
Go get a napkin and throw away?

53:16.560 --> 53:17.400
Like what is this?

53:17.400 --> 53:18.700
No, hold it out in front of you

53:18.700 --> 53:20.200
as though we're like a spider and like,

53:20.200 --> 53:22.840
ooh, I've got a crumb, what do I do?

53:22.840 --> 53:24.440
I'm really panicked.

53:24.440 --> 53:27.920
Why are these people fucking mad dogging you?

53:27.920 --> 53:29.160
Hey, that's what I would say.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.040
If I picked delicious crumb from a spunk and chomped it,

53:33.040 --> 53:34.440
and you guys looked at me like,

53:34.440 --> 53:35.800
I would look at the two of you and I'd say,

53:35.800 --> 53:38.200
hey, mind your own fucking business.

53:38.200 --> 53:40.920
What I eat and do to my body is none of yours.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.800
It's possible that all of these other people

53:42.800 --> 53:44.360
at the computer lab, like they all got together

53:44.360 --> 53:46.720
and they just watched Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.560
Oh.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.560
And they just see you like pluck a crumb and eat it.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.760
And they're like, what if,

53:50.760 --> 53:52.600
oh, and they all just horrified themselves.

53:52.600 --> 53:57.200
What if that was Richard Moranis himself?

53:57.200 --> 53:59.280
I don't think he got shrunk in the movie.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.880
Except he did in the second one.

54:00.880 --> 54:02.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

54:02.000 --> 54:03.600
No, he did in the third one.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.160
Yeah, Honey, we shrunk ourselves.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.240
Then why did you say that he did?

54:06.240 --> 54:07.080
He shrunk the kids.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.480
But he didn't in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.840
He said it in the movie, the kids got shrunk.

54:10.840 --> 54:13.960
He shrunk the kids, he exploded his infant son.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.200
And then he-

54:15.200 --> 54:19.360
The order was, shrunk the kids, saved them,

54:19.360 --> 54:22.200
thought, I'm gonna keep doing this,

54:22.200 --> 54:24.280
I'm gonna keep following this particular dream.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.840
Blew up his son and was like,

54:25.840 --> 54:27.720
oh, Richard, baby, oh.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.640
No, I'm gonna keep doing it, I think.

54:29.640 --> 54:31.680
And then did himself.

54:31.680 --> 54:32.960
And I think that was the final straw

54:32.960 --> 54:33.800
because we didn't get a-

54:33.800 --> 54:35.320
Yeah, the fourth one has to be-

54:35.320 --> 54:36.480
Well, then there's the TV show.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.880
The fourth one has to be Honey,

54:37.880 --> 54:39.760
I think this relationship has run aground.

54:39.760 --> 54:40.600
Honey, I think we need to take a break.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.360
Wait, there's a TV show?

54:42.360 --> 54:44.600
Yeah, with Peter Scolari.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.760
Was the TV show just like every episode,

54:46.760 --> 54:49.800
like, how the fuck does this keep happening?

54:49.800 --> 54:51.640
It was all different machines,

54:51.640 --> 54:53.520
there was the shrinkery was in there.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.560
Do you think that when they were naming

54:55.560 --> 54:57.720
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids 2,

54:57.720 --> 55:01.480
somebody said, we'll go with I Blew Up the Baby

55:01.480 --> 55:04.120
and everybody went, let's see if we can come up

55:04.120 --> 55:05.040
with better than that.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.120
And it was like, I made the baby real big,

55:07.120 --> 55:08.320
I big jumped the baby.

55:08.320 --> 55:13.320
If each one is a sentence that you are saying

55:13.360 --> 55:16.560
to your spouse, then I think by five,

55:16.560 --> 55:19.200
it would just be like, Margaret,

55:20.800 --> 55:23.880
Margaret, I can't fucking believe this.

55:23.880 --> 55:25.320
I know this is gonna be hard to believe,

55:25.320 --> 55:28.000
but it happened again and it's still not my fault.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.400
Baby, I blew up the baby.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.520
Honey, we shrunk ourselves.

55:31.520 --> 55:35.960
Sweetheart, I done fucked this one so bad.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.920
Margaret, this is gonna be the end of our marriage,

55:39.920 --> 55:40.760
isn't it?

55:41.720 --> 55:44.280
Honey, I want you back, that's what it says.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.400
Honey, I want you back and also I'm very small,

55:46.400 --> 55:47.720
please come get me.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.360
Please pick up your very small husband.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.600
Honey, I final listened to your complaints

55:51.600 --> 55:55.120
and blew up my wiener, just like a crazy great hog.

55:55.120 --> 55:58.440
Honey, I shrunk your dad to the point of non-existence

55:58.440 --> 55:59.480
and now he's gone.

56:00.720 --> 56:02.560
Honey, I'm sorry about your dad.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.800
Honey, I shrunk my ego and blew up my level

56:04.800 --> 56:06.760
of consideration for you and listening.

56:06.760 --> 56:08.880
I blew up my listening skills.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.480
Please take me back.

56:10.480 --> 56:12.760
What do you think, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids TV show

56:12.760 --> 56:13.600
is about?

56:15.440 --> 56:17.640
Episode per episode, what do you think?

56:17.640 --> 56:20.240
Episode one, coming strong out of the gates.

56:20.240 --> 56:23.840
I think it's a pretty traditional child shrinking romp.

56:23.840 --> 56:28.840
Episode two, I think they probably should,

56:29.880 --> 56:31.200
I mean, it's all size play, right?

56:31.200 --> 56:33.560
So I think the dog probably gets weird.

56:33.560 --> 56:36.360
Episode three, the whole house got little.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.560
Oh no, all our stuff.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.640
Episode four, he accidentally shrinks

56:39.640 --> 56:42.080
the relationship counselor that they bring in.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.600
And then they just carry him around in their pocket.

56:43.600 --> 56:44.600
He's like a recurring character.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.760
Yeah, it was very cute though, I do like that part.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.440
Episode five, they shrink their son

56:49.440 --> 56:50.800
but blow up their daughter.

56:50.800 --> 56:53.000
And at this point, Peter's just like,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.560
I'm just trying to find new fun ways of mixing it up.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.400
He's just trying to feel alive.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.360
He can only feel alive by shrinking at this point.

56:58.360 --> 57:01.200
I'm just gonna hit both of you guys with some titles

57:01.200 --> 57:04.560
of episodes of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids the TV show.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.160
Honey, we've been swallowed by grandpa.

57:06.160 --> 57:09.120
Literally out the gate, they nail it.

57:09.120 --> 57:13.480
Let me just get on, let me just torrent this real quick.

57:13.480 --> 57:16.720
Torrenting, torrenting, shut up, I'm watching this now.

57:16.720 --> 57:21.640
Shut up, give me 22 minutes, nobody talk.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.480
Just let me sit here in it.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.320
Honey, the house is trying to kill us.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.320
Holy shit.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.640
Honey, I'm haunted.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.720
Honey, I'm haunted?

57:29.720 --> 57:32.680
Honey, you've got nine lives.

57:32.680 --> 57:37.640
Okay, so this is the, what's the fucking cat movie

57:37.640 --> 57:38.960
that's out right now, Happy Cat.

57:38.960 --> 57:40.760
Honey, they're after me Lucky Charms.

57:40.760 --> 57:42.840
No, that's not, that can't be.

57:42.840 --> 57:46.360
Okay, Wayne's invention succeeds in finding gold.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.440
A pot of doubloons claimed by a leprechaun

57:49.440 --> 57:51.800
just having fun with it.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.240
Hold on, just having fun with it.

57:53.240 --> 57:56.040
Listen, I know that the movies are pretty whimsical

57:56.040 --> 57:58.160
with the ant dog and the oatmeal pie.

57:58.160 --> 58:00.120
This is a franchise rooted in science.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.840
But you can't just be like, I don't know,

58:01.840 --> 58:03.920
you know, scientific leprechauns.

58:03.920 --> 58:05.720
Honey, I blew up the leprechaun.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.520
Honey, I know what you're thinking.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.160
Honey, you're living in the past.

58:10.160 --> 58:12.480
That's like a, is that a two-parter?

58:12.480 --> 58:13.840
That's where it all starts to go downhill

58:13.840 --> 58:14.840
for the Zelinsky's.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.600
Honey, I have conquered death.

58:17.600 --> 58:21.960
By the way, they did 66 episodes of this motherfucker.

58:21.960 --> 58:24.160
By the way, I bet Peter Scoleri really feels

58:24.160 --> 58:25.600
in ownership of this role at this point

58:25.600 --> 58:28.000
since he's been doing it 15 times as long

58:28.000 --> 58:28.840
as Rick Maraniss.

58:28.840 --> 58:31.000
Way, way longer than Richard did.

58:31.000 --> 58:31.840
Honey.

58:31.840 --> 58:32.800
What's the finale call, you think?

58:32.800 --> 58:33.640
Honey, who done it?

58:33.640 --> 58:34.560
Honey, we died.

58:34.560 --> 58:37.400
Honey, time stretches before me is an endless loop

58:37.400 --> 58:39.840
through which I'm trying to escape.

58:39.840 --> 58:41.600
Time is a flat circle, honey.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.840
Honey, time's a flat circle.

58:43.840 --> 58:45.680
Honey, now we're all sons of bitches.

58:45.680 --> 58:49.160
Honey, I invented the atomic bomb accidentally.

58:49.160 --> 58:51.720
Honey, I've become death destroyer of worlds.

58:51.720 --> 58:55.000
This is, oh man, this seems like a pretty good show.

58:55.000 --> 58:55.840
It really was.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.680
I actually remember enjoying it immensely.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.480
Honey, I shrink all of Australia

58:59.480 --> 59:01.120
and it's just fucking gone now.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.920
Can I tell you, Scoleri's a treasure.

59:02.920 --> 59:03.760
I love Scoleri.

59:03.760 --> 59:04.920
Scoleri's a fucking treasure.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.120
Yeah, he's great.

59:06.120 --> 59:07.800
Honey, I'm the sorcerer's apprentice.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.760
That was the last episode?

59:08.760 --> 59:09.600
No.

59:09.600 --> 59:12.120
No, the last one's called Honey, Who Done It?

59:12.120 --> 59:13.720
It's a murder mystery, I guess.

59:13.720 --> 59:15.000
Kind of seems like an anticlimax.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.920
You would think they would end with some shrinking.

59:16.920 --> 59:17.920
You would think they would bring it back

59:17.920 --> 59:21.240
and be like, honey, let's bring it home with some shrinking.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.000
Some good old fashioned shrinkage.

59:24.560 --> 59:27.000
Honey, the next last episode is Honey, I shrink,

59:27.000 --> 59:28.800
therefore I am.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.640
So that's where it was.

59:29.640 --> 59:31.040
I was kind of a thinker.

59:31.040 --> 59:33.160
I would like to see one episode in which

59:33.160 --> 59:35.200
he uses the enlarging, right?

59:35.200 --> 59:38.440
But enlarges everyone to 1.1 scale.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.360
So that is like 1.1 times the size.

59:41.360 --> 59:45.960
So it's definitely like weird, but not the inconvenience

59:45.960 --> 59:47.360
that they were dealing with otherwise.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.840
It's not like a giant baby.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.840
It's just like a seven foot tall man.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.520
Well, this has got to be an expensive show, I would think.

59:53.520 --> 59:54.520
Oh, definitely.

59:54.520 --> 59:55.880
What with all the science.

59:55.880 --> 59:58.360
And I mean, they're just going through kids nonstop.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.680
What with all the...

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.880
Do you know how many kids they lost in the original Shrink?

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.720
A lot?

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.560
A lot.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.440
They would just let them out on the lawn

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.720
and then that's it for them.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.920
1.5 kids.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.720
That ant killed six kids.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.720
But the ant has been working in this town

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.120
for so many of the stories that ant could tell.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.360
Honey, I'm rooting for the home team.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.240
That's just one where there's no science,

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240
no wackiness. Nick is upset

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.080
because he's having trouble playing baseball.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080
So he asks his dad to make some inventions

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.160
to help him play baseball better.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.920
That's just cheating, Wayne.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.120
No angels in the outfield, only man.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.240
Elsewhere, Diane is worried about her recital

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.760
and Amy uses a cream that camouflages pimples,

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760
but she uses too much and it hides her nose.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.360
No, no, no, no, hold on.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.040
You can't both give me baseball machines

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.880
and invincible nose.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.480
You're telling me there's two wacky science subplots

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.360
in each episode of Shrink?

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.880
You can't put both in there, Wayne.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.680
Yeah, okay.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680
Last one, I promise.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.360
Honey, the bunny bit it.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.160
Nick invents a machine of his own

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.640
in an attempt to resurrect his dead pet buddy Copernicus.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.480
Oh my God.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.680
Things go wrong when his invention

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.680
summons a monstrous creature from another dimension

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.760
that possesses the body of his deceased friend.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.320
Holy fucking shit.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.240
How's your Saturday morning programming, everyone?

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.520
That's real?

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.880
Nick defeats death and invites a demon

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.400
from another world into our plane?

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.840
Honey, we've lost the plot.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.920
Honey, we went the wrong place.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.960
That's gonna do it for us, folks.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.000
We hope you've enjoyed the program.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.320
Thank you so much for hanging in with us

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.240
on this kind of weird, bumpy three-week schedule.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.960
We'll be back to normal soon after.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.520
I'm gonna actually predict that the next episode

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.520
is probably gonna be a little bit late

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.000
because we are- May we?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.840
No, no, no.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.680
We'll get one up.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.880
It's just I'm traveling that weekend

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.240
and we are gonna be fucking wiped

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.080
because we're doing- I'm gonna be trying

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.440
to find a house.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.920
Yeah, Travis is house hunting.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.440
So the next week will probably be a bit off schedule.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.000
We apologize, but we're gonna get this thing back on track.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.200
We'll probably end up sitting on that live show too

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.200
because girlfriend and I have got-

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.960
Yeah, we need to put some stuff in the tank for this one.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.080
We need to bank some stuff.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:01:59.920
Gotta bank some stuff.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920
And also we're recording it,

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.160
so we probably can put it out.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.160
That's a good point.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160
A lot of twists and turns.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.000
A lot of twists and turns.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.400
This is quite the rollercoaster.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.600
The show, by the way, I just want everyone to know,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.400
I'm very proud of how it's coming along.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.960
I cannot wait for everyone to see it.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.400
Yeah, so we're all- I think you're gonna like it.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.680
If we've sounded like exhausted

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.240
and we did a live Facebook live thing for CSO,

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.080
and a lot of people are like,

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.240
God, they look so tired.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.960
It's not coming from a place of us being like bummed out

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.440
or anything because the show's going really, really well

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.600
and I'm really happy with it

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.680
and I think it's gonna be really good.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.200
We're just leaving on the fucking horse.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.040
We're just all going so deep in the pain.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.520
We're using every bit.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.360
You know what I mean?

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.080
We don't have anything that at the end of the day,

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.040
I am a toothpaste tube rolled from the bottom, you know?

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.720
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.560
for the use of our theme song,

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.400
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.840
It's a great album that you should go get.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840
Also wanna thank Maximum Fun for having us.

Go click on podcasts.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.760
Go listen to stuff like Beef and Dairy Network

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.020
and Judge John Hodgman and stop podcasting yourself.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.160
We all have other shows and video stuff

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.080
and Twitter stuff that you can find at McElroyShows.com.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.720
I would like to plug one in particular.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.760
We just did an episode of Schmaners

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.880
in which my wife did like a biography of Emily Post.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.720
Oh, interesting.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.760
That was amazingly fascinating.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.540
Emily Post like was incredible

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.880
and like Theresa did a great job with it.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.440
It's my favorite episode I think that we've recorded so far.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.400
And I just wanted to plug that and say,

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.440
go check out Schmaners, listen to that Emily Post episode

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.960
and educate yourself on Emily Post.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.920
She's amazing.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.760
Yep.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.640
Is that it?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.600
That's gonna do it for us, folks.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.880
Thank you so much for sticking with us.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.440
We have a final question.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.280
Yeah.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.120
Found by Griffin.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.360
And what we do every week is Griffin reads this

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.600
and we kind of think about it and dwell on it

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.440
and then we come back the week after.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.800
Just sort of focus on most of our energies

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.680
and just like release.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.120
Yeah, it's so nice.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.820
Anyway, this one was sent in by Rachel Roseng.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.200
Game recognized game, Rachel Roseng.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.440
We need to write down a fucking list

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.760
of what everybody's stuff is.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.800
You need to write down a list.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.280
Yeah, you definitely need to do that.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.120
Thank you, Rachel Roseng.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Earl, who asks,

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.720
what is Mary Tyler Moore's role in the big scheme of things?

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.560
So good.

Listener supported.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.600
Why would you listen to a podcast of TV pilots

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.040
that never got made?

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.880
It must not have been any good, right?

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.240
I don't know for a fact that anyone read it.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.640
They couldn't get to deal with that.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.040
There was kind of a regime change.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.240
Someone at the studio who was in a decision making capacity

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.640
said, these guys seem like losers.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.120
They just blamed it on, OK, well, it must be women.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.960
We got word that USA had decided to stop doing comedy.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.320
Why aren't we making this?

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.760
It was so good.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.040
