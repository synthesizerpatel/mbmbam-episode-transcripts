WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
If you're all alone, with a pretty verse

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
Carve another notch in your bedpost, you've done it, you've made time in your week for us

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
My brother, my brother and me

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
This is an advice show for the modern era, I am Justin McElroy

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
And this has been my brother, my brother and me, the end

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Have a great week

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Have a great week, it's the beginning, don't worry about it

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Can we address?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Just right from the get

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm addressing it

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
We fucked up

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Take it a head on

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Fucked up

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
We fucked up

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
We done fucked up

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
We done fucked up

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
We done y'all wrong

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
This show is like two weeks old, it's like a two week old infant

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And we went ahead and we done skipped a week

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Done skipped a week

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Can we assign blame?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Memorial Day, what's up?

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
So we're blaming Memorial Day for our malfeasance

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Memorial Day caused us to forget

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah, we forgot to make the show for you

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Right

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, I'm eternally sorry

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
I want to apologize because I expected like we skip a week

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
And then all the love falls out the bottom

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And we lose all the love

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
But I did a Twitter search for the title of our show yesterday

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
As I want to do

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And still just a lot of people support

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
A lot of questions, not a lot of anger

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Mostly just sorrow

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
And I want to apologize

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
A deep hunger was the theme

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
I want to personally deeply apologize to little Badkins

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
He's a way fish young lad who lives on the streets

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
He was heart broke

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
He was, I'm so sorry Badkins

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We'll send you some new matchsticks

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Can we just say, make it official

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Episode 008 right now, official decree

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
We will never miss another week ever again

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Until we die

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Until we die, and even then we'll get two more shows out

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, ghost shows

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Here's our first question

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Comes to us from FormSpring

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
FormSpring questions are anonymous

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
If you want to send a question to us

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Listen to the end of the show and we'll tell you how

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I've been seeing this girl lately

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And every time we have plans to hang out she bails on me

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
If we don't make plans

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And I tell her I'm just going to show up

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
She's cool with it

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Is this a case of plans are meant to be broken

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Or is it something more

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Oh my friend

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I didn't know that was an idiom

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
No dude, plans are meant to be broken

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
No actually, that's kind of counterintuitive

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
To what a plan is

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
They're actually meant to people do things

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
If plans

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
What's the difference between making plans

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And telling her you're going to show up

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Is that not a plan?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Is that not a thing?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
That seems like an awfully narrow distinction

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I think it seems like if you and I

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Should go somewhere

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Okay cool

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I'm not going to do that

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm going to be at a place

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Are you going to be at that same place?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
We'll see

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I think maybe she's just not

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Necessarily

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Into this relationship right now

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Or maybe she just loves

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Scavenger hunts

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Have we considered that?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Maybe she likes to pretend it's serendipitous

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
She doesn't want to meet you

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
She wants to find you

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And a lot of the times

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
We try to tell ourselves with stuff like that

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Maybe she's just the type of person

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
That breaks plans

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And she's all willy nilly and crazy

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
No, she just doesn't want to hang out with you

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
She is the type of person

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That doesn't particularly care for you

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So much anymore

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Plans are meant to be broken

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Hey they are

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
My GF

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm a different person now

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
She's always wanting to go out to dinner

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
But she expects me to romantically choose

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Where to eat and pay

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Despite the fact that she pretty much

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Always eats steak no matter where we go

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Also money is tight

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Should I cave to her demands?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
My suggestion

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Plan on a really fancy dinner

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And tell her about it and then don't go

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And she'll look at you like what?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And you'll be like plans are meant to be broken

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Can I just say how much I love

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
The concept of romantically choosing

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Where to eat dinner

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Like baby girl

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I've been thinking about it for a long time

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
But I think

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Golden corral

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Golden corral girl

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
You want to get some of them hot buttery rolls

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Sensual rolls

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Sensual rolls

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Um no

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
She wants you to be in charge

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Like a man say this is where we're going tonight

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Steco

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Also start calling your

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Call your GF Steco

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
She'll love it

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah and also

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Don't let your girlfriend eat steak everywhere you go

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
What's the matter with her

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
It's not healthy

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Take her to a vegan restaurant

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And see if her head implodes

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Next time she buys steak just cough

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And be like please choose another option

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Cough

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Please choose the chicken

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
She'll have the chicken

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Are you dating a caveman maybe

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Or a feral wolf

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Maybe you should romantically order for her

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
She'll have the chicken

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Thank you Garcon

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
As dry as possible please

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Another form spring question

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Does my best man have to be a man

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
My closest confidants

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Are all female

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And I have just casual mostly

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Uncaring relationships with the majority of

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Guys in my life

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
His closest what

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Confidants

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That's how they say it

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
In France

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I don't know that's awfully progressive

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't have a problem with it one bit

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
No you wouldn't

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Well I have a lot of female friends

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Right but we'll never have to deal with this

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Because we've already agreed that we're going to be

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Each other's best man

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
This is correct

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
We've signed that blood pact

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I forget how it breaks down

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Alright

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
What if like Steve Gutenberg

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Rolls up the day of my wedding and is like

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Hey I've got like two hours to kill

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Could I do it? That's fine

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Would you understand Justin?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh what if for the Goots?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Yeah when the Goots in there

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The only thing I would wish is that we could be co-best men

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And I could go to things remembered

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And have a co-best men

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Necklace made that would be broken into

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Two parts with two separate chains

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
So it would be like a dead hooker

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Or a death stripper

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And one of you would get one part and one of you would get the other

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And when you link it up it shows

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It shows

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
That you are co-best men right

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Also I want to kill a hook with Steve Gutenberg

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Once again we've created

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The greatest movie idea ever

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The new Steve Gutenberg

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Vehicle co-best men

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
That sounds like

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
An Adam Sandler movie

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
No it's Steve Gutenberg and Dave Coulier

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Kevin James and Adam Sandler in co-best men

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Hey guys

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You can do it

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Can we give this guy some real advice

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I think it's okay

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah it's fine

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But make her wear a tux

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Hey can I say this? It's your wedding so tell everybody to eat a bacon

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
In this scenario would you

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Have to refer to her as best man still?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I would say best woman

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I think I would still go with best man

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I was kidding about the tux

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
But I think

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Talk to your fiance first

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Gender switching

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Is not that

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Sydney had

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Guys in her party but they weren't bridesmaids

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
They were bridesmen

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Can you have groomsmen?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I had to walk down the aisle

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
With one of them

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It may be best maid

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Best lady

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You should probably marry your best lady

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
You have to realize

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
That's what's going to happen

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Day of the wedding

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Right before you get cold feet

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Your lady friend

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Confesses her

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Your wife might have a problem with that

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
That's what I'm saying

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Talk to your fiance first

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
My official advice is I don't know

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Is your best woman going to be

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Jennifer Lopez?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
If so you're definitely

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Going to switch over at the last second

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Hey you know

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Guys I have this problem

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Every time I talk to some stranger on the phone

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
They mistake me for a woman

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
What can I do in the future to prevent this?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't drink whiskey or smoke so forget about that

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah are you 12?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
That you don't drink whiskey or smoke?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Maybe pick up one of those and we'll meet you halfway

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Could I suggest

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Either saying your name

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But what if your name is like Aaron

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Double A Aaron

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And that doesn't help the matter at all

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So to cut any confusion I would say

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Just call a person up

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And they say hello

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And you say hi this is Aaron

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Man can we

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Hi this is Aaron I'm a fella

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And let's keep going

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm known dude Aaron

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You should do

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
My name's Aaron got a wiener can we talk?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
My suggestion would obviously

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Be to talk like Christian Bale

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
From the Batman movies

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You reach Aaron's residence

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm a Russian chicken

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I want a chick

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm gonna wear an

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Augie Paz

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Or just go with it

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
That's not your problem if they think you're a woman

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
That's their problem

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And their embarrassment when they realize

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
The faux pas they've made that's a power play dude

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Some people are paid

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Big money to live life as a woman

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And they get the full taste of it for free

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
If you could do

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You could leverage that if you were

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
In the

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Telemarketing industry

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Leverage it in the sense that

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I think female telemarketers

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Probably are more successful than dudes

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Cause they can call up lonely dudes

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And you know

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Get a foot in the door

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Telemarketresses?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Telemarketrinas

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Telemarketrinas

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah just go with it

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I've known a girl for a while

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And since I got back from college for summer

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
We've been hanging out a lot

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But I'm not sure if I can make it a relationship

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Because we go to school 100 miles apart

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Advice

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
100 miles ain't nothing

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
100 miles is a

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Pretty long distance actually

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
No it's like 2 hours

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I say don't date a girl

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Who lives farther away from you

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I was gonna say that you could walk

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
To but that's

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Probably better

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Could you throw in a pinch

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I could throw a shot put

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
100 to 150 yards

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
That's why my wife lives with me

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
In my house

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
How far do you think you could throw a baseball?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
About 5 feet

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
50 feet

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
You think you could clear it from the mount?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I'd get it at home play

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh yeah I'd get it at home play

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Funky of the year and they'd hire me on

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Funky butt loving

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Funky butt loving?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
What?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Here's my advice

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Would you give him a high stinky cheddar?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Yes I would

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
This young person has already

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Answered their own question

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
You don't think you can make it a relationship

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Guess what? You're not gonna

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You would know

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
He's unsure

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah but he would know

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
If it's a cross country trip

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
If 2 hours isn't worth it to you

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Then I think you've already answered your own question

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Real life

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Is gonna work really hard

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
In every relationship

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
To try to tear it down

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
If you're not sold on it from the jump

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It's not gonna pan out

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
If she's the one

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
You wouldn't be asking us this question

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
If you were sure about it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You wouldn't trust us to the reality of a long distance relationship

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Is way harder than you think it would be

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
100 miles apart

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You know where I live 100 miles from?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Kings Island, I don't get there

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And you love Kings Island, that's the relationship

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I do, I love the Viking

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Fury, I wanna make that relationship

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Beautiful boat

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Let's do one from Yahoo

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
This one comes from Chris D

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Chris R?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Not Chris R, Chris D

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Please help

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Where should we make out?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Well, me and my girlfriend

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Are both going into 9th grade

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
We're both 14 and she wants to make out

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Where should we make out?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And this is my first make out

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
So any tips would be great, thanks

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I heard like during a movie

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
In the theaters, but I don't know

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Any places would be great, thanks

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Easy 10 points

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I think if any places are great

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You should stop worrying about it so much

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Dude, you can't

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Has it been so long

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Since you went into 9th grade

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And we're about to have your first make out sesh

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That you can't recall the mortal

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Terror that is involved with

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Finding a locale for this

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
To go down

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
This is hard, now it's suddenly hard

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, cause I can recall

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Exactly, and I also recall

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
The

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Unorthodox

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Solution that I came up with

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Oh Christ

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It was in Ritter Park

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Which is a park

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That was a few blocks from my house

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
In our hometown of Huntington, West Virginia

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And there's a

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
There's a little

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Concave, like a little

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Circle

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
A little stone circle

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Of benches that's kind of hidden

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Beneath the shady trees

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
But

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I think that that circle was

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Constructed as

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
A monument to

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
AIDS

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Yes, it's the AIDS circle

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Which is probably

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I don't know

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Disrespectful

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Maybe not romantic, maybe not the most

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Romantic thing I've ever done in my life

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
But you have to get your make out on

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And you have to do it in a place where your folks won't catch you

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Did you wrap it up?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Cause that would have been disrespectful

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah, definitely, I played it smart

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Even at 14

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I find dens

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Dens and basements

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Dens and basements are awesome

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Friends tree houses

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Parents can't stay up forever, dawg

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
They're old

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm almost parent age, trust me

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You can't stay up that long

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You'll outlast them

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I don't think I've

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I never, ever, ever got fresh in a movie

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
If I see you making out in a movie

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm gonna fucking smack you

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
If you're gonna do it

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Sit in the back

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Cause people paid so much money to go to that movie

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
They don't need to hear you're smacking

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But it's in 3D

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Here's the thing

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Right now you're paying 12 bucks

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
To get into a movie

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
15 bucks, don't waste that money

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Watch the damn movie

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That's 15 dollars

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You're halfway to a cheap hourly motel

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Unless the movie

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Is really bad and you can add

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Some humor to it

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
You know, like

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Train my dragon

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
If you're in the middle of it

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I like that one

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
There are people like me that will sit

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Uncomfortably close to you

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
So that you are not able to do that

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
On the note that I just brought up

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I wouldn't do it in like a kid's movie

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Don't go to like a generated movie

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Some of us have

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Made out during Toy Story 2

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It was creep

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Flubber

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Dear podcast

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Okay, kind of inhuman

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Last night I went to my friend's

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
21st birthday party when suddenly his girlfriend

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Who was very drunk told me

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
She had feelings for me

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I don't feel the same about her

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
So my question is how do I or even

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Do I tell my friend

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Okay, hold on

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
You're at

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Your friend's birthday party

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
His lady tells you

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
She has feelings for you

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You don't have feelings for you

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Guess what you got buddy

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You got a little something I like to call a non-problem

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
You do not have an issue

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
That you need to address

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Here's the important

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Little segment there

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
She was very drunk

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Doesn't matter

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I say things

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Say things you wouldn't believe

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It's astonishing how many questions we get

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Where my answer is just pack up

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
And move away and never talk to anyone

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Involved in a scenario again

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Because that's literally the only

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
The only solution I have for this

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Maybe that's why I've been such a globetrotter these past few years

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You keep messing up social

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Situations and you gotta move

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
In my mind this is unfixable

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And you have to get out of there

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's called a global reset

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
You can either stick around, don't say anything

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And then have it be awkward forever

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Or you can tell your friend and he'll get mad

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
At you and

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You know

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Here's what I'd do if I was you

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Don't

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Don't say anything

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But frequently

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Ask your friend how his relationship

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Is going and then when he answers

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You say oh yeah? Cool

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I guess

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Can I suggest a honeypot

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Scenario

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Where you tell the

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Friend and then if he doesn't believe

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
You'd be like no no no check it out

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And then you

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You get the friend drunk

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
No well no that's exploitative

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But you know

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You were gonna suggest a baiting situation

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Yes get her to confess those feelings again

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I like that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Like you're wearing a wire

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Or your friend is like hidden in the closet

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And ask her about the new package

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And ask her where Omar is

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I assume that's a joke

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Cause we haven't washed the wire

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You need to talk to your friend's girlfriend is what you need to do

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
No you don't need to tell

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh shit people don't want to hear about things

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
They don't want to talk about them

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Your two options are honeypot or move the fuck away

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Change your name

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Change your name

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm gonna switch these gmail

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Gmail questions cause these people have their names on them

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Ender

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I know right

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Ender writes tons of people I went to high school

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
With are already about to get married

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Or are married and I've only been out of high school

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
For two years what am I missing here

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
A girlfriend

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah let me throw in a little side note here

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
This email comes to us from Utah

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't know if that changes

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Your outlook on this but it does for me

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
So they get married

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Like six years earlier than

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Probably the median age in the nation

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I think that's a fair

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Figure

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
What you're missing is a partner to go through life with

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And you are going to die alone

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Ender you're not missing anything

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You're 20 years old

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You're kicking it living it large in Utah

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Yeah

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Going to jazz games

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Listening to jazz games and

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Listening to jazz and

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Going to jazz basketball games

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Just jazzing

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
In general

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You need to stop all that jazz and get yourself a girlfriend

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I don't

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Are you going to college

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Well he didn't say he's going to college

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
He said he's been out of high school for two years

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Just pair up quick

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Cause your options are dwindling everyday

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I'm probably the only person from Huntington

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Who's not married

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And I

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I'm so fucking lonely

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
All the time Ender do it just find someone

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Anyone

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You know one of my friends once told me

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Who was married he said marriage isn't a goal

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Marriage isn't something you work towards

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's something that happens

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
So

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It is a goal in the sense that if you don't cross it

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
By the time you die then you've failed it

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Yes

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Whatever it's a goal if you don't cross it by the time you're 30

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It comes out

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Speed it up Ender

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Matt writes to us from gmail

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Says myself and my friend

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And my brother and me

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
That's not true just myself and my friend

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Myself and my friend recently went for the same job

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And he got it ahead of me

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Do you have any advice for how to

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Deal with this

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Yeah keep your mouth shut Matt

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Move to a different town

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Just move away dude

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
No I mean that sucks

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
That sucks pretty royally but

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
You gotta ask yourself what would he do

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
If the scenario was switch

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And it sounds like he's a really good friend

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And that he wouldn't

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Cause a big stink about it

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I think in any situation even if he would do that

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
You gotta be the bigger man

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And if he's really your friend you gotta be happy for him

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
You know what I mean

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
At the end of the day what is more important the job you went for

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And the friendship with this kid

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Well the job

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Probably

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It sounds like a great gig

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
With a nice big salary and lots of benefits

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And also Matt

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
He's probably more qualified than you

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
He probably got it based on merit

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
He deserves it

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
He earned it What did you do

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Wow

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Good jobs Matt

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Can we give Matt an internship

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
At NBNBAM Industries

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Matt is the first intern of NBNBAM Industries

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
What's he gonna do

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
He's gonna promote the show

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Is it paid

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
He's gonna sell tribes and away slavery

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Can we scrounge some money together

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
To give this guy a salary do you think

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
If I get any money I'm gonna spend it on a Facebook

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
App for our show

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah that's true

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
6x9

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Who's a known gmail user

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Asks I've recently moved

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
To the states from Australia

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And I'd like to find a low calorie

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Beer to drink I have no problem

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Sampling from your wide selection of microbrews

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
On occasion but I'd really like a nice beer to drink

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Regularly and I don't need the extra

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Calories I'm looking for a taste sensation

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
But something that tastes better

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Than brackish water would be nice

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Any suggestions PBR

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
He asked PBR

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Get out of this website

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Get off the podcast

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I mean you can't go wrong with an MGD-64

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
How about I slap both of you

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
In the mouth

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That's the only low calorie beer I mean

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
No okay let me

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Hip you guys because you're

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Like children you're like an infant

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Tickling yourself with a razor

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Number one

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Is your an

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Infant tickling yourself with a razor

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
The best low

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Calorie beer is Guinness

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Which clocks in at

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
125 calories per bottle

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That's high calorie

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
That's not comparatively high

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Calories the idea that beer

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Has calories in it

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Is astonishing to me

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I don't know why I've never been able

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
If you drink too much beer you get fat

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
My brain has never been able to

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
It's a liquid

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
It's not a food

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Have you tried pork chunk

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Ale

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I don't think it's real

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I would say that

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Your top three

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I think Guinness is good

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Right after that I think the

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Two best light beers you can get

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Are

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Sam Adams Light and

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So if it has light on it

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Then that's what that means

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
You would be surprised

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I would actually check calorie

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Comparisons

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
A lot of those light beers

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Are not as low calorie

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
As

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Like a Guinness or something like that

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Guinness is low in calories

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I'll tell you what I had a lot of

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
When I was up Shytown

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Is that light?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Would you say that's light

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I would say that's probably

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Ripping with calories

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It felt airy in my mouth

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It had an airy quality to it

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I would say go with that

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
And don't worry about the calories

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Because you deserve it

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Girl

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
You're worth it girl

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
130 calories per bottle

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Not bad at all

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Also

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Jack and Diet Coke

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It saved you a bunch of calories

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Dominic

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Says I'm trying to be more outgoing

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And looking for more venues to meet people

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And possible relationships

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Would church groups be a good start?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Even though I'm not particularly

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Churchy

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Or do you have any other suggestions?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay Dominic

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
That won't be a great conversation starter

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Hey what's going on

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Mallory

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
No I'm not particularly churchy

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I'm not churchy

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
This is apparently working for you

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I think so

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I made a lot of good connections

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
In

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Church

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
My old church

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I actually went out to dinner last night

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
With old Alex White

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Good people

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I don't know if he's thinking

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
About love

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Relationships

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I think maybe he's just talking about friendships

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And if that's the way to go

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Now if you're looking for someone

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Who's going to give up to pussy

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
God

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Well

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
There it is

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Speaking of

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Speaking of

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Speaking of

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Speaking of

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Speaking of not particularly churchy

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
This yahoo answers question

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Comes to us from Dick

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh man

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Dick asks

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
If there is no oxygen in space

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Then how does the sun burn?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Answer that atheists

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Christians 1 Atheists 0

He's got you there

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Game over

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Fuck

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Ah shit

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I don't have an answer for that

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I know you don't

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Hey do you guys see what Dick said?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Theology professors across the country

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Who just like

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Exploded

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Oh wait a minute

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Dick just solved it for all of us

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Everyone knows that the sun burns cause the devil lives inside

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Yup the devil lives in the sun

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Duh what's up

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It's your first night at the rodeo apparently

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I have to thank

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I did a little bit of

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Crowd sourcing that question

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Was actually sent to me by

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Godly is the person's name

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Who sent that to me so thanks Godly shout outs

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Shout outs

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I've been having problems

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
With expressing my anger

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Says Sean from Gmail

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And I was wondering if you could help

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I'm a 17 year old New Zealander and over here

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Any showing of anger to anyone

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Will often result in a physical fight

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I have the problem that I seem to

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Either bottle it up

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I've been meditating late

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And it seems to help a little in thinking about things

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Or completely fly off the handle and hurt people badly

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I was wondering if you guys could help

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Hey Sean

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Hi

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Sean

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
You're a

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
You're talking to three guys

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Who are raised Baptist if you're looking

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
For guys who are telling you to not bottle

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
It up you've come to the wrong podcast

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Keep it inside

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Or get to your bottle

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Breaks and then you get a bigger bottle

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I don't

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't know

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I can't I think the last time

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I got angry was when I was

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I was

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Making a left turn onto

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
The interstate and someone behind me

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Was upset by the fact that I was making

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
A left turn so they passed me and gave me

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
The finger and I just wanted to get out

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Of my car and

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Just

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Hurt them

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm so bad at it see

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Would you rather be Sean the guy who

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Expresses his

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Feeling in a healthy way or Sean

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
The guy who at any second

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Could fucking flip and fight somebody

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I kind of like the last

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Sean yeah right

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
That Sean's cool that Sean's crazy

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Like Sean's crazy

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Nobody knows what the fuck Sean's about to do

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
What's Sean doing now

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Sean's drinking everybody stops

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Looks at Sean real slow

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And maybe this time Sean laughs it off

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
But next time fucking Sean

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Is basically a human

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Version of Kerplunk

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Yeah only the marbles are his

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Rage and every time you

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Scuff his pumas you're pulling a stick

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Out

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And once you step on that

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Poo that wrong time you're sunk

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Also Sean in real advice

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You're 17 dude you're a wash of hormones

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And emotion yeah completely normal

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You will calm down as you get older

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Meditation's the best way to go

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Just think about everything someone's

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Scuffing your pumas not a time

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
To pull the stick out no if you

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I mean if he's 17

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
If you don't let that anger out

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Then you'll get really bad acne

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That's where

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Those hormones gotta work

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Them out of your body little anger volcanoes

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I actually saw

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
A dermatologist when I was 17

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I had really bad skin she said

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
You got lots of anger volcanoes on your face

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Thanks

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
What's Sean

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Don't hurt anybody Sean

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Everybody

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Don't follow our advice ever

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Dude have you guys heard about Cody

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
From Gmail where he's going

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Next weekend no

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
He's taking a trip up with his

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Family up to Canada

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Oh Canada I like it up there. Homeland of

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Rafi

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I love to drink

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
And I'm 19 years old which means

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I can drink in Canada however

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
My mom hates that I drink

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
How can I get shit faced in Canada

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Without my mother getting upset

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Cody

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I have great news for you

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
This is a wonderful

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Time

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
To start practicing the art of

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Flaskmanship

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
She don't need to know anything

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
She turns away for 30

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
10 8 seconds

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
You got that flask out you pound it

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
You're done

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I would say also that it sounds like

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Laws aren't keeping you from drinking

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So much in the US of A

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
So what's the concern

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Well there's a difference

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
There's a difference between

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Our laws

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And statutes and mama

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Law mama law

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I think he might be afraid of

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Transgressing

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
On mama laws

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Which I understand

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Maybe what he's saying

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Is the reason he's excited about drinking is because

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
It's legal right what I'm saying

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Is it doesn't seem to be slowing down

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Although I'm sure the beer in Canada is so

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Dope

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Cody why do you need to get shit faced

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
As you put it

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Can you not just

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Have a beer or two

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Do you have a

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Do you have an eye opener Cody

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Do you ever have an eye opener do you ever drink alone

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Again I

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Would you say your mom has a problem

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
With it do you mean she keeps having interventions

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
For you because that's a different thing altogether

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I've got

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
A Canada fetish so I imagine

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Everything is cooler in Canada maybe

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Getting drunk in Canada is like the sweetest

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Thing ever like maybe a mount he sees you

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
On the street and instead of arresting

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
You like he gets off his horse he's like hey go

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Ahead just take one around the block

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Winnie

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Maybe

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Getting fucked up and eating poutine

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Is like you know

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
A religious experience

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Joel writes to us

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
From Gmail he says I'm in a bit of a

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Predicament I recently moved to a new

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Town and I only know a few people I'm not

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
In college so I can't meet people that way

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And I'm 19 so I can't meet people in bars

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Can you guys put your heads together and

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Give me some pointers on how to meet people and make friends

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Joel started the D&D group

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
That's a really good I'm actually

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
You're joking but I met a lot of people

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That way I'm not joking I think that would be fun

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Give a call to Dominic and go to church

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
With him sometime

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
He just wants to tell you about a friend of his his name

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Is Jesus on the serious on on Justin's

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
First point there's a website called meet up

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
You can use that to find groups of people

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
That have your interest maybe not D&D maybe knitting

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Maybe scrapbooking maybe that's

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Joel's game you can find a group

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And do that thing with them

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I wish he had told us what city he was in

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
And then we could have some MBMBAM

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Like friendship connections

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Here's what we'll do Joel go to Facebook

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Go on our appreciation group

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Put some stats

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Some things you're into the city you're into

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
We'll make that connection

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Height weight eye color

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Basically a match.com profile

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
But put it in our Facebook group

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And then see if you can find any

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
People should be using our Facebook group for friendship

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And love connections I know

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I wish more people were doing that

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I want by our next show to have at least one

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Piece of verifiable evidence

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Of two kids who found each other

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
On the Facebook group got together

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
And fucked

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
What kind of verifiable evidence

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Are you looking for? Kicks

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Jesus

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Here's one

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Yahoo answer also sent

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
To me by Action Allen

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Thank you Action Allen this one comes from Kyle S

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
He asks

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I need a list of the

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Most practical kicks

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
What?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
What? Oh just you wait

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I want a list of kicks

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
All must be practical and where they would land

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
So far the obvious ones

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Front kick to groin

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Mid area head

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm sorry

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Side kick to groin

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Mid area I personally don't like

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
This one because it's hard to see

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Round kick

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
To lower leg back of knee

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
All suggestions are welcome

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I'm about to kick the spirit

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Yeah how about

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Below to your subconscious

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Hey listen

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Why do you need this list?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Sean what are you doing?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Guys can we get

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
He's got the front he's got the side he's got the round

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Have you considered a donkey kick?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
A back kick as it's

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Referred to it in some circles where

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
An assailant comes behind you

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You can usually kick the front

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Of their knee or groin area

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
And that will completely take them

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Out of the fight all together

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Have you tried a spin kick?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Spin kick's really good

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
That's the coolest kick you can do

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
When the point of your boot goes into their

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Butthole

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
A butthole kick

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
A butthole boot knocker

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
A well aimed butthole kick

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Have you tried perhaps like a

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Ryu style bicycle kick where you fly

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Through the air for 10 seconds and squeal

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Like a pig? How about an awesome kick

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Where you literally take their head off

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And one cleans it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Have you tried the mental kick

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Where you don't actually kick

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
But they think that you do

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And then in three days their stocks crash

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
What about the kick where you

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Take your foot off and make the guy smell your foot

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Like in a funny movie

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
The Zoans

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
That Zoan movie. That's pretty funny

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Have you tried a taint kick?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
What?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
A taint kick where you kick them square in the tank

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
And it lifts them off of the ground and into the air

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
By about three feet

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
That one's really hard to do. Could I suggest a kick kick?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Which is where you kick their kick

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And disrupt their kick

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
They're meant to kick

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
You gotta be careful though because if you don't time it right

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
They'll kick your kick and then you're fucked

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That's a kick kick kick

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
The triple kick. The KKK

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Have you tried a punch kick?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Which is where you take your shoe off

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And put it on your hand

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And then you punch them with it

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Oh god

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That's a pretty

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Comprehensive list I feel

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah I think that's all the kicks

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
That's all the kicks I know about I guess

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
What about the junior kick where you kick their kid?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah that's sometimes more painful

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
In the long run I mean

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
What do you think? One more question?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Before the last question? Yeah

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
You got time for one more? Griffin you pick

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You pick this time

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
This one comes from Allison via Gmail

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I like a sociable smart

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Funny nerdy guy

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
But I don't know where to find them

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Why'd you pick this one? Weird

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't want to show up at a magic game and be laughed out

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Because I'm playing with my merfolk deck

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And can't remember all of the rules

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Or be ignored because I'd rather watch someone play the horror games

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
For example Fatal Frame 2

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
So that I can cover my eyes when it gets scary

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
How do you suggest I go about finding

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
These guys without running into the creepy stalkers

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
On Craigslist? Do they even exist?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Say it

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Griffin you are fucking adorable

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
You can tell me how girls get your attention

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Sorry okay well thanks

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Well thank you

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
This one was a confidence booster

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
For me

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
A little pep in my step

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
The pep in your step kick is good too

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That one hurts really bad

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Whoa that has something extra

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
He kicked me right in my pep

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Wow right in the pep

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I will say that

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
In situations like this

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't think

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I don't think ladies need to use their

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Their nerd charm to try and attract

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Fellas because their usual old

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Feminine wiles will

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Serve them pretty well

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Yeah I think actually you're going to attract the wrong

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Kind of guy by being outwardly nerdy

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Yeah maybe that's just me

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Here's the thing

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
The nerdy guys they already want to go out with you

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Because according to your email you're pretty

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And they're guys

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
They're probably lonely

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Here's the trick though

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
The trick is you've got to find the right kind of nerdy guy

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Because

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
God love them you may not want to end up

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
A lot of nerdy guys can be kind of socially

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Eh retarded

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And I don't mean that in the

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Retarded sense I mean socially retarded

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Like slow

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Inept just comically inept

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Look at our emails

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Just pick like the top 5 from the people who

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Email us every week and we'll send them to you

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
No kidding

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah not a joke

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I think the MBMBAM community is a good

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Place for you to cast

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Your proverbial net

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Yeah that should pan out real good

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Just go on our Facebook group and post a

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Picture of yourself and say you're looking to meet the eyes

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
We don't have time to read his question

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But we got a question

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
From a gentleman

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
We've been debating how to pronounce his name

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Khem Lewis

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I think Khem

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Lewis sent us a picture after we

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
We mentioned that we got a ton of questions

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
From people who don't know how girls work

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And he sent us

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Pictures of himself and his girlfriend

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
And he looks like a really dope

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Like a kind of guy

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Like a dude I could be best friends with

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Best friends

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
He's got himself a cute lady friend

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I imagine that Khem Lewis

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Is the norm

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
In our little family

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
That we've built

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
You live in that house of cards and tell me how it works out

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I think he's the coolest

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
He's the best of us

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Don't try hitting on Khem though

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Because he's got a lady friend

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Khem's not the fan we deserve

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
She's a cutie

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Also

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Allison

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Opposites attract

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Be your classy lady that hides from

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Horror games and shows up with her

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Merfolk deck

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I don't know what that means

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And you want guys

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
That are attracted to you in a

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Romantic sense and not a friend sense

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
So you don't have to appeal to their

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Nerdy side

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Appeal to their man side

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Griffin how does a girl get your attention?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
She sends me flattering

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Emails over the internet

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
No she

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
She goes naked day one

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
No I very much fit into this

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I try to put on air

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm so cool but

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
I fall into the group of people

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Where if a lady walks up to me and is like

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Hey I'm like I love you

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Thank you

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
For giving me this chance

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I love you

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I promise that I will take this trust

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
This sacred trust that you've put in me

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
By saying hi

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
But seriously sir do you want

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
A grande or a bento?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Do you ask everyone that?

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Let's go out

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
You want to go to Starbucks?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Damn it

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
We're already at Starbucks

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
But first I want to tell you fine

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Folks at home how you can get in touch with us

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Twitter and use the hashtag

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
NBNBAM we like that one a lot

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Because it helps promote

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
The show you can go

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Gmail NBNBAM at

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Gmail.com you can use form spring

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Which is at form spring dot form spring

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Slash emails

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Slash show

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Slash form spring

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
If you want the actual link to that

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
You can go to NBNBAM dot com

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Where you can find all this jazz

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Um

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
The Utah Jazz

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Also thank you so much we've passed

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
300 ratings on iTunes

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And we're approaching 150 reviews

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Really great

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Can we just have a solid minute

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Where we thank everyone for being so great

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Like we missed a week

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And people were hungry for it

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And I hope that this

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I hope that we can somehow in the future

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Find a way to make up for it

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
But please tell somebody

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
You know about the show

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Cause it

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
It really does

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
That's the only way we can spread

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
We're not advertising or anything

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
You gotta

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
We're gladvertising

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
The show makes you happy and then you tell people about it

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And here's what happened

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
We were going to advertise and then we watched a lot of Mad Men

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
And then we just ended up getting drunk

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I can't feel that world

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I can't put money in those

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Misogynist hands

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I would suggest maybe listening to us in your car

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Maybe you're doing that right now

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Look out! Just kidding

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Roll all your windows down

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And just blast it

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Yeah

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
And then we'll be like hey people on the streets

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Download NBNBAM

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Hey everybody

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Look at this fresh car

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
You wanna be like him?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
He knows what he's doing

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
We gave him this car

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Make sure you check out our Facebook appreciation group

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Allison's gonna be on there

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Joel's gonna be on there

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Dominic's gonna be on there meeting

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Christian girls

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
That's what he's into apparently

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But that's the

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That's the whole podcast

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But we wanna have something to grow on

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Something to ponder over the next week

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The ensuing week

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
We promise it won't be a week until the next NBNBAM

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Next Monday

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
So Griffin why don't you break us off a slice

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
This one comes to us from

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Yahoo Answers user Chuck Boris

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Who asks

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
How many drops of LSD

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Should I give a 4 month old to get her to stop crying

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I'm Justin McElroy

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I'm Travis McElroy

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I'm 7

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And this is my brother and me

44:14.000 --> 44:40.000
You will never know me

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
You
