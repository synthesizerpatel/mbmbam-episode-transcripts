00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
If you're all alone, with a pretty person, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
If you got no place to go, with a pretty person, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
True. Or just Ja!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
We be jammin'!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
No, I don't think that.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
No, you don't.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Maybe in jam making.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Speaking of which, we've gotten way too many jam making questions lately.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Guys, do we look like we know about preservatives and shit?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
That is so, so not our area of expertise.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah. We don't know anything about marmalade. You want to bring that marmalade heat, you're gonna find some willing participants right here.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
But as far as just straight preserves.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Fruit preserves.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Pickling, brining.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Griffin German.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Apple butter? What's up?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
This is an advice show.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
As you've probably already deduced, this is an advice show for the modern era.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
So we're just going to, oh, my name's Justin McElroy, by the way.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm Travis McElroy, BT dubs.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
It's what? It's just even shorter than BT dubs.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
It's new school.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You guys ready for a question?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You guys ready to help some people out?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Can we talk about something real quick?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Please do.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I don't know why, I just wanted to wrap.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I feel like there are events that are happening regarding the show that we should discuss.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Oh, oh, oh.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, I was going to wait until the end to talk about that, but we were...

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I mean, let's just thank everyone up front.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, well, thank you.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
It's been so cool.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
For us in a, I think it's votejet.com or something.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, prestigious.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
They're basically like the Oscars.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
It's like a Gallup poll.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Very official.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Gallagher.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Like a Gallagher poll.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's basically like a Gallagher poll.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Like a Sledge-O-Matic.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Anyway, they're doing this contest for the top comedy podcast,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
and we're currently in third place because people have been voting for us off the chains.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Thank you so much for doing that.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
We're in third, eleventh, and fourteenth, I believe.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, we're in a lot of places because their polling system needs some work.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It does need some work.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
They need to put all our votes together.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
But we certainly appreciate your efforts there and your support.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
As always, it means a lot to us.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
You have no idea how good it does our heart.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
We want to help you, though, by making you smarter and probably safer with our advice.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So here we go.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Say you're walking and you see an attractive lady as Swarmspring.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
This is a sexy hypothetical so far.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Good start.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Sexy start.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
You want to appreciate her attractive features,

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
but you also don't want to come across like some creepy construction worker.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
What's etiquette?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
If you see her while making eye contact as you pass, help.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Swarmspring.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
You have to make some audible noise.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Some audible noise has to come into the equation.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
I don't know if it has to be a fully formed sentence or what,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
but you do have to.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
She's not going to get it just with a sideways glance.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You've got to give her like that.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, but she's going to get it.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You know what's up.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Hey, and joking aside, don't do anything.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's the 21st century.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Are you kidding me?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's a bow.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Mouth siren.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
You're a human being.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You're a human male.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You take a look at her as she's approaching you.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
You decide instantly whether or not she would be a suitable sexual partner,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
and then you keep that decision to yourself.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
You walk home and you watch some TV.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
That's your day.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
That's your afternoon.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's not going to be like, hey, lady, I like your gams.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Getaway sticks.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Nice pins, lady.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Nice pins, babe.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
You, Lou, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Give her a good work there.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Nice work you've done there.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Just look at her and just say, nice.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
That's a handsome package you've put together there.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I like what you've done with all this.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Don't do any of that.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Shake what your mama gave you, but say it as you're walking away and go to full spread.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Just look at her and say, I'm sorry.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
You don't realize what an inconvenience that is for that woman that you've called out on the street.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
Even if you did this with the most chaste intentions, it's probably going to be creepy for that woman.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
Unless you are immensely attractive.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
If you're immensely attractive, you say whatever you want, okay?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You can do whatever you want if you're immensely attractive.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Physically attractive.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
You can lean out of your Mustang and say, I'll never appreciate you, and she'll hop on in.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Yep.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I'm sort of like your dad.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Let's go.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I'll ignore you most of the time.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay, I would suggest a warm smile.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
If you give someone a warm smile, if they are creeped out by a warm smile, they're the creep.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Because you were just smiling.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But it also says, hi, we made eye contact.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Warm smile.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And maybe you'll see something in there.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Some sort of like that spark.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
If she's the one, she'll know it.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
That's the sound my sparks make, too.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Like you're a transformer.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
But you've got to practice that warm smile.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Practice it.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
If you give her a creepy Cheshire Cat snagglepuss smile.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
If you look in the mirror right now, you're probably working with something positively reptilian.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
If you can't pull it off, try doffing your cap and saying, ma'am.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
If you love press.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I like it.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Don't do that.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Why not?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I can't get behind the...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
What if you do it in a fun accent?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
There's no way to not do that.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Excuse me, madam.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You can't do it without a fun accent.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I fucking hate those dudes.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Who try to pick up the accent as far as by...

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Fancy a shag.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Some sort of creepy affectation.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, man.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And then you've got to scuttle off.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Boop boop boo.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You're gone.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
I do not believe that there is a good way to pick up someone as you're walking in the opposite direction from them.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Hang a U-turn and just follow them.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, exactly.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Give them a flat tire.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Step on their heel.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And make their shoe come off.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
And be like, oh, how awkward.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Stay about three feet behind them and say things like, where you headed?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Where you going?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I'm right here.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I'll just be with you for a while.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I'm with the FBI.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So I feel like we've helped him enough.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Is it ever acceptable to go to a bar alone?

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't have a lot of friends who are over 21 and I really can't have them over at my apartment for parties.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
This is the guy from last week who just wanted to go to bars and he lost all his friends.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Now he wants to know if he can go to a bar by himself.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
I would say that it is a...

08:24.000 --> 08:34.000
Unless you are, again, just really overwhelmingly physically attractive and can almost be guaranteed to go home with a sexual partner that evening.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Or at least get a phone number or something.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Or make a new friend.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah, that's the thing.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
There are more reasons to go to a bar than to...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Here's the thing.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I've thought about this question a lot.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
And the answer is yes, it is acceptable to go to a bar alone.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It depends on what kind of bar you're going to.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
If you're going to a sports bar and you're going to be hanging out with a bunch of people that you can have discussions with about what's going on in the game or whatever.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And form new friendships and talk to people.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, it's a great place to meet new people and make friends.

09:10.000 --> 09:20.000
If you're going to a bar to sit in a table in the corner by yourself and drink 20 beers, no, that's not okay.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
I actually went to a bar alone last night.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
Just because I didn't really do much of anything this week as far as leaving the house.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
And I work from home, so sometimes I have to make myself go out.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I don't think I've ever met anyone at a bar, really.

09:38.000 --> 09:48.000
But it's nice to just get out of the house and be surrounded by other people and have a drink and watch the wrap up of the day's baseball contests.

09:48.000 --> 09:58.000
The good thing about going to a bar alone is that you can really feel free, especially if you're looking to mix up your situation, i.e. meeting new people, trying new things, whatever.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
If you don't go with anybody you know, there's no real expectation to quote unquote be yourself.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
You can sort of try different things and be whatever kind of person you want to and no one's going to call you out on it.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Like speak with a foppish British affectation.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Don't do that.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
In my circle of friends, I'm that guy who knows nothing about sports.

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
But I could go to a sports bar and be that guy who's really into football and no one around me is going to go, you don't know anything about football.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
But when you start shouting, asking when the Orioles are playing, you're probably going to get some.

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
I think the best thing to do if you're going to a bar by yourself is to think of it as becoming a regular in a bar.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
There's a bar in Huntington called Hanks, which is a great place to do that.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Like the same 20 people are there every day.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
And it's a place where, you know, the few times I've gone there, I know the people there now.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
So a bar like that, great.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Don't go to like a club by yourself because then you're creepy.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
But, you know, go into like a hangout.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
No, I think it's OK to go to a club, especially if it's like a dance zone.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
You want to be able to like get out there and just shake it.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
Like you want to be able to, with every song that comes on, no matter how bad it is, be able to throw your hands up with wild abandon and say, that's my jam.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
You're saying like go to a bar alone, leave the bar alone.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Sam, feel the rain on your skin and just for once just get out there, you know?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
This is where your book begins.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
This is still unwritten.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
In fact, if you're wondering about your book and where to kick it off, it's here.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Feel the rain on your skin.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
This is the answer to our second question.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Setting a good pace for this one.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Good pace.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Yahoo Answers.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
This Yahoo Answer was sent in by Wax Catharsis.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Thank you, Wax Catharsis.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
He's becoming a platinum submitter of funny Yahoo questions.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
He gets access to the lounge.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user know-it-all who asks, who sings better, Justin Bieber or Cisco?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
The thong song.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
What?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
That's all part of the question.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Why wouldn't he hook us up with a Bieber title?

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
He goes on to explain the thong song was the biggest single since Billie Jean, Michael Jackson.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Do you think that Justin can top that?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
He's coming from the Cisco side.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
He's defending Cisco here.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
He has got that full-on Cisco heat.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Cisco is the greatest artist that has lived since Michael Jackson.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm pretty sure he had the number one single.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
One of his friends said, Bieber is the greatest musical artist of our generation.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
He said, excuse me, what about Cisco?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
He was laughed down.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
He turned to his only friend, the internet, to prove him right.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Yahoo Answers is always there for you.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
That Cisco knowledge.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Where do you guys stand?

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Do you view Bieber or Cisco?

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
Bieber has so much to go through in his life that Cisco has already gone through.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So you're saying Cisco's got the experience?

13:02.000 --> 13:11.000
Or do you say Bieber still has so much in front of him that he can be shaped and formed by his experiences to a sum that is greater than Cisco?

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
I think that what needs to happen is a musical apprenticeship of Justin Bieber to Cisco.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh my god, reformed Drew Hill with Cisco, Justin Bieber, Ellen DeGeneres.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
And that kid from Hanson.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
The little one.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
The kid from Hanson.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
The littlest one.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
The baby.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The one that's like three or four.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Still.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Forever.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
The forever baby.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Super group.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Forever baby is another good name for our band.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Call them the traveling Wilburys too.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
They'll just go around.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Here's the thing though.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
They would never collaborate on a single musical project.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
They would only do versions of their own composite songs.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Like they would sing thong songs.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
They would sing Baby.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Listening to one of their CDs would be tantamount to listening to it now.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That's what I call music in 1994.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
That's the experience.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
How many of those did you guys own?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Be honest.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Zero.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Zero.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I owned three.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
What?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah, I owned three of them.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
The third one was an ironic present from Justin Minsker.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And how many times did you listen to that ironic present?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Oh, a lot of times.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
A lot of times.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
There's a really good fastball cut on that one.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
A really deep cut.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
A deep cut?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
They got it out to the bernyard fastball track.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Was it um, was it perchance the way?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Hey my bim bam.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
I recently started dating this guy and he's really awesome and everything.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
But I don't think he changes his sheets often.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
How can I encourage him to tidy things up a bit?

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
Ooh, this is a great question because this is one of those weird like um,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
I find that a lot of people have made that jump from childhood to adulthood

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
and not picked up on the fact that you got to change your sheets.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I had no idea.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Travis had no clue.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm not going to say how often I change my sheets, but how often is regular?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You're supposed to do it twice a month.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Twice a month, realistically, people are doing it once a month.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Let's be honest.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
What if you don't sleep on your sheets?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
What if you sleep on top of a comforter?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Then you're some kind of caveman.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
You're a caveman.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
You're sleeping on bearskin rugs.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
What if you don't want to bother with changing your sheets?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
So you sleep on top of a comforter and then use a quilt.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
What if you sleep hanging upside down in your closet?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And you use a quilt for a blanket.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Do I have to change my comforter?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Is it whatever layer you sleep on top of?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
It's whatever you put your dirty skin on you dirty fuck.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
This is why you have bed bugs.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
This is why America has bed bugs.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Bed bugs don't just come from your body.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Your body isn't dirty and then bed bugs come out of it.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Bed bugs live in your eyes.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Everybody knows that.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Hey, don't joke around about that because then I'm going to have thoughts.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Justin once convinced me that there were tiny spiders that lived in my eyes.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
And that's what made the sleep crust when you wake up.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Oh god damn it.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Awesome.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
And you love spiders too, which is the best thing.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
Okay, so here's the way to do it, okay?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
You've got to just change those sheets.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I'm sorry.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You've got to change your sheets.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
But it's not her choice.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
It's her boyfriend.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Think about what a nice thing that'll seem like.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Hey, I just noticed your sheets were looking a little ratty.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Like maybe it had been a few weeks since you changed them.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
And then in his head he'll think, oh shit, it's been a few months.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
And he'll be thankful to you for not rubbing it in his face.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
But like pretty much every other option you have is going to be super passive aggressive.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
What you're going to have to think about is maybe he doesn't have another set of sheets.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Does he?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Buy him new sheets.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Buy him new sheets.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
Be like, hey, I was at Walmart and I thought these sheets really matched your curtains or something.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
And here you go.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And then give him the option.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Hey, I got a suggestion for reform spring.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
How about you just started dating this guy and you're already intimately familiar with his sheets.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
Maybe you need to figure out what you can get right with Jesus.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Think about that.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Maybe.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Think about it.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
Nobody's going to milk the cow they buy at the store for free.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Think about it.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
That's what my granny always says.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
But granny said to me at least.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
She was she was really bad at idioms.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
She was really bad at idioms.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
They used to they used to call her the idiom dummy, which to me was a missed opportunity.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
But somebody laughed at that out there.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Trust me.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I have a situation that is.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Oh, that has been long been debated amongst my friends.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Is it wrong to take Nick?

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Can we go wrong?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
OK.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
Is it wrong to take a naked jacuzzi with your dad and other men in a men's locker room after a hard workout?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
No one.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
No one checks.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
There's there.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
There is.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
OK, before you start leaping to conclusions, no one checks anyone out.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
But it seems silly to me to dirty a new swimsuit after working out, especially since it's a five minute jacuzzi before a sauna.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
I mean, even if I wore a swimsuit, you are naked under anyway.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
No, no, no.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
OK, let me beat that.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Jeff, let me be devil's advocate for Jeff real quick.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
If you do not wear a swimsuit, you get in a jacuzzi naked with your dad and other friends.

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
The components of that stew that you're you're you're broiling there is dicks and water.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
OK, can we agree that is a dick, a hot dick and water stew that you are brewing up.

18:40.000 --> 18:50.000
If you wear swimming trunks, then the components to that stew are swimming trunks, water and dicks still.

18:50.000 --> 19:01.000
So if no one's checking anyone out, you're just adding some some cloth and some mesh to to the dick jambalaya that you're you're creating there.

19:01.000 --> 19:10.000
OK, but let me counterpoint that by saying that same logic can be applied to any situation in which clothes are worn.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
You know, like if we're naked under our clothes anyways, why don't we all just go to school naked?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, that's not a good that's not a good excuse.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
But it's different because we wear clothes in normal life so that nobody can can see our dicks when you're in a jacuzzi.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
It's not about the site. It's about the knowledge.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
It's about no, it's about it's about the water convection.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Right. It's all about convection science.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Explain to me this, Jeff. Now, I'm I'm not you, Jeff.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I've not walked a mile in your shoes, but maybe you can explain this to me.

19:42.000 --> 19:50.000
If I'm walking through my gymnasium and I'm walking to the sauna and along the path to said sauna,

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
I see my dad and a bunch of old men naked in a tub and my dad's like, hey, Jeff, do you want to get in this tub with all of us?

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
We're naked and our balls are out and everything. Do you want to do you want to get into this?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Jeff, our Jeff, our balls and everything.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Don't even kid yourself. Everything's Jeff.

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
I have changed my answer. Any scenario that you can enter into that may possibly,

20:21.000 --> 20:30.000
even if it's like a zero point zero zero one percent chance of touching dicks with your dad is a scenario that's worth avoiding.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
What if there's an earthquake? Oh, no. Get out. No, I'm coming. Oh, no.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
I got to get I got to go to the bullet store and kill myself. Jeff, you can't take what?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
OK, why did we even entertain this possibility? Jeff, you can't take naked baths with your dad.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
And you get a cell phone call. And someone's like, what are you doing, Jeff?

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
You're like, I'm just taking a naked bath. My daddy and some old friends and their balls are out.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
That's great. Let me give you a formula. All right.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
You plus naked dad taking naked bath. Not OK.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
Why does adding like eight other naked dudes make it better? That does not make the situation better.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Is my parka too much? No, it's not enough. Jeff, it's never enough.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
You're taking a naked bath with your dad's and all his old friends.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm going to go out on a limb and say if you were in eight separate Jacuzzis,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
but only naked and looking at each other, it's not any better.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, it's not any better. It may be worse.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
What's the maximum distance that you have to keep your naked genitalia away from from your dad?

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Three states or one layer of cloth.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Unless that cloth is trunks. Now, one addendum.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
I think this scenario is OK if you're Greek, if you're like super Greek and not like you have a little bit of Greek in you.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
But I'm talking like heavy Greek. No, heavy Greek.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
Then it's complete. If you're going heavy Greek, you're OK to take a naked bath with your dad.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
That's the science. I've started dating an awesome girl.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
Oh, rub it in, guy. Yeah, real nice guy who didn't think to sign his email.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
Oh, no, no, no. It's two lines. Thanks, Jeff. No problem.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
I've started dating an awesome girl. I found out she likes to watch hilariously bad movies.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
This is one of my favorite pastimes, so I'm pretty excited.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
What terrible films would you recommend for a fun date?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Can anything be both horrible and romantic? OJ.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
OJ. OK, Griffin is going to suggest a film to you that I am going to immediately poo-poo and I will tell you why.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Griffin, go ahead. It's The Room.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
OK, but it's not The Room. Think about this for a second, OK?

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
You just started dating a girl. You're like, hey, I have this hilariously bad movie.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
And at first it will go great. It will go really great.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
For like the first 15 seconds? No, for the first 15.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.000
Well, yeah, yeah, basically for like the first three minutes. There's like a lot of sex scenes and like really gross sex scenes.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
And like uncomfortable, non-sexy sex scenes. Like the grossest.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
It's really gross. I think he's got to get to know her a little better.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
I disagree. I mean, I think it depends on what age you are.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
I think if Jay's in high school, then maybe not, because that's something that high schoolers aren't ready to see.

23:08.000 --> 23:18.000
Tommy Wiseau's horrible, glistening like swamp thing body thrusting up and down on top of Lisa or whatever that actress's name is.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
That is a nightmare. But I think once you're old enough, you can see the humor.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm going to throw a Kung Pow into the fist.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
See, but that's not a terrible movie. But you like that movie.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. But it's like, I mean, it's it's funny, but like it's it's pretty bad.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
You feel bad for liking it. Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
I'd like to recommend two films that you should check out after last season.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Oh, man. It is really brutal and Birdemic.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
If you can find Birdemic. See on the Birdemic front, get on that Netflix instant queue and just start searching for sci-fi original movies.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
It's a killer mega shark versus giant octopus. Yeah, that's a good one.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
That one's good. How about how about Mega Fault, which was Brittany Murphy's last cinematic onus?

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh, my God. Not only does she look like she's already dead in that movie, it is.

24:14.000 --> 24:22.000
Oh, come on. It's it's about a giant earthquake that can kill people, even if they're in helicopters in the sky.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
OK, it's a turn. It's apparently. Yeah. So it's a good choice in there, Jay. Jay, I say wait a couple months on the room.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
But Justin, what is it that Dwight always makes people watch on Bad Movie Night?

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
What is that movie with John Ritter? Oh, no, no. Real Men. That's a fine film.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
No, watch that. It's awesome. Yeah, it's a really good movie.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
But God, it's just rub it in Griffin's face day. I'm in a seven year strong relationship with the one.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
What are some good romantic ideas for showing her how much I appreciate her?

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
The standby is a nice home cooked meal with candles. Anything that comes to mind?

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
Forbespring, if you're making your wife a candle at dinner, you are ahead of the curve.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
And can I just say, he doesn't say wife. So if that's not the case, how about putting a ring on it?

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah, that would be a pretty nice. I think that's why that ring on that was invented.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah. You know what you could do? Get the ring and then keep focusing on the dinner thing.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
So that way, if you ever burn dinner, you have a backup plan.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Sorry about the roast, but do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
Do I have to eat your gross burnt roast? If so, no. Nope.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
Eat as much roast as you want. That's what marriage is. Eating as much roast as you want.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
I think you got to just surprise her. I think that is the best way.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
Surprise. Thoughtful surprise. Skywriting. Skywriting.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Guywriting is good. Have a guy have naked men spill it out in your lawn.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Guywriting is great. In a jacuzzi. Freshly jacuzzi.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
Hey, by the way, retroactively, Jeff, jacuzzi is not a verb. Stop it.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
We took a jacuzzi together.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
We took a jacuzzi. No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
You took a dick bath together.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
I jacuzzi you of taking a naked bath with your dad.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
I feel like we've already ruined his chance at romance for his whole life with this episode.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
He'll be lucky if he can feel anything ever again.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Here's a romantic idea. Don't let her listen to this episode.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, that's it. Baby, I was going to make you listen to this podcast I like, but then I decided not to.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
You're welcome. Surprise.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Yeah, she'll know.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Griffin, you got a Yahoo? I do, actually. I was just about to bust it out.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Break it off. This one was sent in by Mike Susek. Thank you, Mike Susek.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
It comes to us from Yahoo! Insta's user InJordan72.

26:50.000 --> 26:58.000
Hmm. He asks, is it possible to be addicted to Tabasco sauce?

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
I put Tabasco on everything. I think it may be unhealthy, but I just can't stop.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
I went to my local community center, but they said they didn't have any programs for my type of addiction.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I don't know where to turn it. My mouth is on fire. Help.

27:11.000 --> 27:20.000
Hey, I got, you know, a small suggestion that you may find helpful.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
Stop eating so much fucking Tabasco sauce.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah. Why don't you try just if you're about to put it on there.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
If you see yourself opening the cap of a large bottle of Tabasco,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
then don't do that and go do something else instead.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I am going to throw out, though. Here's my thought.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
If all he's been doing is putting Tabasco sauce on everything and like burning his mouth,

27:45.000 --> 27:50.000
everything is going to taste like cardboard now, like wet nothing cardboard.

27:50.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, he's killed. Mix it up. Get the planet's finest condiment, Sriracha, and start putting it on stuff.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
Mix it up. I guess I got some garlic in there. Got some Thai chilies. Delicious.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
There's this show that I've started watching recently.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
It's called Freaky Eaters, and it's about people addicted to weird things.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
And I watched this episode the other day where a girl drank 30 cans of soda a day.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
That's not OK.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe don't cure your addiction. Get on TV.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
That's what I'm saying. Hook that shit up.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Get that money.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
You guys remember when I used to put Tabasco on everything?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
And then your stomach revolted.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, my stomach died. So that's a very serious side effect.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
What most people don't know is Griffin has a monkey stomach.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I do have a monkey stomach.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
You know what Griffin's favorite fruit is now?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Nanners?

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Pears. Actually, weird. That's weird. It seems like a missed opportunity.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Tabasco pears. Griffin loves them. Can't get enough.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
Is it OK to request an attractive girl in my class after talking with her and sharing a bunch of laughs today in class,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
even if I'm not sure she even knows my name?

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
I should have said friend request.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I just said request.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I request that woman, please.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Would you like to?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I've had a couple classes with her in college the past year,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
and I would like to get to know her and ask her out eventually,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
but this is the first where we've actually talked to each other.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
Appreciate the advice. Sincerely, Facebooked. Gmail.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I love it. I love it.

29:25.000 --> 29:34.000
I feel like we have made it as an advice organization because of these pseudonyms.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
This is our second question about this whole adding a friend thing.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I think this is a new wrinkle in the Facebook era,

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
where it bothers me, but at the same time it's so convenient.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It makes stopping so easy.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, I feel like though you're going to miss out on –

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
I feel like if you Facebook friend request a girl that you don't know that well,

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
you're going to miss out on a lot of the stuff, the good stuff that comes with getting to know somebody.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
There's so much you could dig up there in a creepy way, not in a good way.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Part of this problem is that a lot of us put too much on the internet for people to look at.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
I get that.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Here's the thing.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Socializing over the internet, it's convenient,

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
and it may allow you to interact with people that you normally wouldn't,

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
but ultimately on the grand scale of social interaction,

30:32.000 --> 30:38.000
it's kind of like eating corn chips in that you can eat a whole bunch of corn chips

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and never really get full.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
It's empty calories as far as socializing goes.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
If I could translate that into human language.

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
I would rather have one really good long conversation with a person than a hundred Facebook chats,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
because ultimately I don't think those add up to anything.

30:58.000 --> 31:04.000
I got that, but it takes little to no effort to accept your friend request on Facebook,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
so it means nothing.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And you're going to get the wrong idea.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, and she says yes, and you're like, yeah, she added me as a friend.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
She probably doesn't even know who you are,

31:12.000 --> 31:18.000
but it's so easy to just click yes rather than try to figure out who that person is.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
I'm officially on the side of I don't think it's a good idea to use Facebook to get a relationship going.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Use the old-fashioned way. I think you'll be better off in the long run.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
I think that it can work, but it's probably not going to.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
There's no added benefit to using Facebook.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
It just seems like a way to hide behind Facebook.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Just go talk to her.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
If you had a good conversation with her, play off of that.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Yeah, keep talking to her.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
You know what I'd like to see?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
It meets space.

31:45.000 --> 31:56.000
I'd like to see an entire relationship that lasts an entire lifetime that just only takes place on Facebook.

31:56.000 --> 32:05.000
The two people never have any real-life physical interaction, just pokes and chats and wall posts.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
And they create a baby.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
They create a poke baby.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Poke baby.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
I have created several poke babies with our listeners.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Man, the pokes are blowing up, guys.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
They are blowing up.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Every time I log on, it's like 30 to 40 pokes.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Then I have to take five minutes to respond to all of them, but it's worth it.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
It's totally worth it.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Keep those pokes going, folks.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Keep going, pokes.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
It's how you show you care.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
I met the most amazing girl a few weeks ago.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Jesus Christ.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Wow.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Ouch.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
She's intelligent, classy, beautiful, loves wine and art.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Sounds too good for you.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Yep.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Anyway, I'm not liking the way this is going, but let her go.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Keep at it.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
Anyways, I manned up, got her number, and asked her out on a date a week after I met her.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
You ask her out in real life.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
That already puts you ahead of the curve.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
We went out, and it was absolutely amazing.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
One of the best dates I've ever been on.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
We went out to a nice dinner, raking up a bill close to $80.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Well, I've got a fairly good job.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
It was still a bit expensive for my taste.

33:01.000 --> 33:10.000
Problem is that if we're going on a second date soon, which will include dinner, and I'm not sure if I should take her to a similar place or if things will go fine if we go somewhere cheaper.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
It's only been one date, but I'm afraid I've set a standard for outings hereafter.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
What are your thoughts on the amount you spent on dates in San Francisco?

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
I have the best answer for this, like legitimately good answer.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
For what?

33:22.000 --> 33:29.000
You need to trade the cost of that dinner for the amount of thought you put into the date.

33:29.000 --> 33:37.000
So, a picnic doesn't cost you a lot of money, but if you set it up really nice, it's more impressive than an $80 dinner.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So true.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
That is such a good point.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yes.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Unless she a gold digger.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
She a gold digger?

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Which is a great time to find that out on the second date.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah, good point.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
It's either going to like separate the wheat from the chaff or it's going to save you a few bucks.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It is a win either way.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
But guys, she is intelligent, classy, beautiful, loves wine and art.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
You can't take a fine, fine woman like that to Benagans.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
But you don't.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I'm not saying go to Benagans.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Griffin, you're not paying attention.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
You're not thinking.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Take her to a museum where there is no admission but suggested donations.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
She loves art.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
And then suggest that if she wants to donate, she do it from her own purse.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Yep.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Buy a $15 bottle of wine from Kroger.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Fuck that.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Three buck chuck.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
And go on a cheese and crackers picnic.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
You're in San Francisco.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
You have great parks there.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Right?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
I see it in Full House every Thursday.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
I know.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
It's hard to have a picnic in those parks though because I mean if you have any round

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
fruits, they'll just like roll right down the blanket.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And the tanners are always raising a ruckus.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
You know them.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Get out of here Comet.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Get out of my potato salad.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Get out of my potato salad Comet.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I have a crush on a guy.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I've worked with him for a while.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
He is the reason I got into my boom-bam.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Oh, I like him already.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
I know I am hot enough to go.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Nice.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I love it.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
I love it.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
It's awesome.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Do I A. bed him and lose my best friend I work with or B. not bed him.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
How do I not sleep with someone I have a crush on?

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
P.S. would keep it in my pants for Griffin McElroy.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Tasha.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Thank you.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
What does that mean?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
I have one question here.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
What kind of praying mantis are you that if you sleep with him you lose him and kill him?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Where does he go?

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
I think Tasha, I think honestly that you, it is more fun to have someone at work that

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
you flirt with and have the possibility of doing it than to do it and it's like weird

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
forever.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
You know?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I don't know.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
What do you guys think?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Well it depends.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Do you have a crush on him and you want to do him or do you like him?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Or do you want to have sex with him and then eat him apparently?

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
And then eat his head and lay eggs in his throat.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Did you lay?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Listen I had a great time last night.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Me too.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Did you lay eggs in my thorax?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
That's really weird.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
I've got to say I feel a gurgling down in my midsection.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
It's very odd.

36:05.000 --> 36:14.000
I think Tasha if we're voting I say don't have sex with him and kill him but maybe

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
and also Tasha you're hot enough to bet him he should be advancing on you.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Let him set the pace of this.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
He should come to you.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
He should come to you.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
I think you need to start making jokes about doing him but never actually doing it but

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
always have that possibility hanging in the air.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Wait a minute.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Wait a minute.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Wait a minute.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
This guy listens to the show.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
We're officially advising this girl to give him a cold shirt.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Listen.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Okay listen.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Dude we're doing it for your own good.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
She wants to eat you.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
She's going to lay eggs in your thorax.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
She's going to eat your face and lay eggs in your face.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Have you ever seen Species?

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
We have a unique opportunity right now because this is the first time that we've gotten

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
a question like this where both parties we know are listening to the show.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Whoa.

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
I think instead of advising them to do one or the other we should just say you two kids

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
just swap tartar sauce like the next time you see each other but Tasha don't eat it.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
They need to make out in the supply closet toot sweet.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
What is it?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Toot sweet.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Today is Monday.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
They're probably not listening to the show before work.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
We'll say after work so Tuesday morning.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Tuesday morning.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
No discussion.

37:23.000 --> 37:32.000
I will say 10 o'clock supply closet Tasha and Doug or whatever your name is.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
Wednesday morning I will keep an eye out for all of the newspaper reports about people

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
over the country named Tasha and blank filing sexual harassment suits.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Or getting murdered and getting eggs laid in their abdomen.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
One of those two.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
One of those two.

37:48.000 --> 37:55.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question but I feel like there's a few housekeeping things

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
we need to take care of.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
First off NBNBAM.com is our website.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
You can go there to ask us questions, to find links, to buy t-shirts which I would suggest

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
you do because supplies are running low.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
So if you'd like a t-shirt you want to stock up for the holiday season.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
We want to issue some new items but we're kind of holding off on that until we sell

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
through on this stuff.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
So if you want something go get it.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
And if you want something new, if there's an item you think you'd like to see on there

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
please let us know.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Drop us a line.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
We can make original artwork.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
If there's a phrase that a lot of people would like on a t-shirt.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
I know we've had some requests for pack your bags and move away on a t-shirt.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
And really the holiday rush has begun.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
I don't know if you guys knew that but it's in full swing.

38:47.000 --> 38:56.000
So I think the best present for your Christmas or your Hanukkah or your Ramadan or your Kwanzaa

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
is a BIMBAM shirt.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Yep.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Forever.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Every holiday.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Shirts will last you forever.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
They're the gift that keeps on giving warmth.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Fashion.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Protection.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
Protection from spears and arrows and things.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
No it doesn't do that.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
And also jibes.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Jibes.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
No one's going to take a shot at you without shirt on.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
And if you get a second and you want to review our podcast on iTunes that's great because

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
it helps to turn people onto it.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
And subscribe.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Please subscribe and download.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
We have had a couple listening parties.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
We recorded invitations to them this week.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
If you're getting a few friends together to listen to BIMBAM.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Introduce some new people to the show.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Let's shout them out.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Jeff Monloch.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Jeff Monloch.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
And John Nugent.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
John Nugent.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Both having parties.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Turning them out.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
If you want to be in that.

39:49.000 --> 39:55.000
John Nugent is in BIMBAM Fan Club 2.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Beta.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Beta.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Beta.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Beta.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Okay.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Beta.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And Monloch is Fan Club Prime.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
So if you want to be on that exclusive list of cool fan clubs that have BIMBAM parties.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Please email us.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Let us know.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
You know.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Tell us about your party.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Who's coming.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Whatever.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
We'll record something for you.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Special.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Just to keep you sort of in close to our bosom.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Don't fake us out though.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Don't fake us out.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
You got to send pictures or it didn't happen.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
Pics or it didn't happen.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And thank you so, so much for listening.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
I haven't checked the download count in a while but I'm sure it's over a million.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
This week it was seven.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Seven people got it.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
But those seven people really liked it.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Yeah.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Oh.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Oh.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
We have a voicemail too.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Which.

40:46.000 --> 40:53.000
The number for which is 203 MBMBAM1.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Okay.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
So give us a call on that and just talk.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
We got a few calls this week and I love listening to them.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
You listen to all of them, right?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I listen to every single one.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
I just like hearing their voices.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
You know.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Yeah.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Right.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Especially if they sound real serious because you can tell they're nervous and I like that.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
That's a turn on for me.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I can taste their fear.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Last question.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Hit me.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Hit me.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Break me off a slice.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
I'm debating between two.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
All right.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Choose wisely.

41:21.000 --> 41:28.000
This one was also sent in by Mike Susek.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
It's from.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Oh God.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
I don't even know how to pronounce this name.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Binguenide Street.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
God damn it guys.

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
Who asks, how can I grow a Tom Selleck like mustache like Magnum P.I.?

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
How am I supposed to break to this?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
I'm Justin McElroy.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
And this has been my brother, my brother, me.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
You will never know me.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
Unless you're in a dick soup together.

42:03.000 --> 42:22.000
Then don't.

42:22.000 --> 42:34.000
I'm Justin McElroy.
