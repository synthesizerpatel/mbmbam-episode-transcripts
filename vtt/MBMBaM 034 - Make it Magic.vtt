00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:34.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
The weather outside may indeed be frightful, depending on your location. There's only one thing more frightful than that, and that's ignorance.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
So, come sit by the fire of wisdom. The delightful fire of wisdom with my brother, my brother, and me.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
There's some toastie over here. It's really cracklin' over here.

01:05.000 --> 01:16.000
Crackle, crackle, crackle. Foley, foley, foley. This is my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. We record at Fireside every week, whether or not you know that.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Put another log on there. It's a toastie show.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
It's funny to me that you should mention, you know, depending on your location, because just this year I realized that just because it's snowing here doesn't mean it's snowing everywhere in the world.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
This is interesting, Travis.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Whoa, really? This is like a rap and beats level of confession.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, it really was like, winter here is not winter everywhere else, and I had no idea. I just assumed when it got cold here the entire world was cold, and that's apparently not how the world works.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
That's like some middle ages shit.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, that's about the goddamn dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
This is my brother, my brother, and my pet canary that somehow gained the ability to talk is the new show.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Let's jump right into the advice.

02:08.000 --> 02:23.000
My female friend and I just got drunk at a party the other day, and she began to become a little more touchy-feely than usual, holding my hand, following me around, standing quite close to me, at one point laying down in my lap.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Wait a minute. Is she a puppy?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Yep, that could be.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I'd just like to know if this means anything.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
I've heard people express their true feelings when they're under the influence. Is this true?

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
I'd like to know, as I have more than friends' feelings for her, and I'd like to know if this could mean that she does too, confused in Kali.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Is Kali her name?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
It sounds like...

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Going well.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
As far as the whole idea of people expressing their true feelings when they're under the influence, that is true up to a point.

02:55.000 --> 03:06.000
As we've used this phrase before, a bell curve, where it's like, truth, truth, truth, truth, drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk, and then it just becomes like, I'm going to give you a million dollars.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
They're not really going to give you a million dollars. They're drunk off their ass.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
And love is one of those emotions that's heightened by affection, you know, when you've been drinking a lot of times.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Especially physicality.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, right. It becomes like you kind of love everybody.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Also, some people are just sluts.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I mean, dudes can be dude sluts, I'm not being...

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Dluts.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
There are plenty of dluts out there.

03:30.000 --> 03:41.000
It's just that sometimes when people get drunk, they're not particularly showing you the true love that they harbor for you in their heart of hearts.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
They're just being kind of slutty, and they feel like they have an excuse to do so because they're drunk.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
It could be friend feelings heightened by the drunkenness.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
And honestly, my advice to you, like the action item that I would tell you is you can't read anything into it.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Not at all. You got to ignore it.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
Not pretend like it didn't happen, but you can't be like, ah, check mark, done, I'm in there because you're not.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Now, if she had done this sober, well then yes, holding your hand, laying down your lap.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
But drunk, it's just hard to apply the logic there.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Now, it could be worth...

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Man, see, I was about to say, ask her, you know, did that mean anything?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I don't think it's awkward enough.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, it's like super weird.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
You got to slow play it.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
You got to slow play it.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Because this is how friendships get in weird, you know, half romantic situations.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You got to protect yourself.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Here's my advice to you.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Get super drunk yourself and then get handsy.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I like that.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Get reverse handsy.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
Maybe don't get super uncontrollably drunk though, because there might be some lines that you cross.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Or just fake drunk.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Drink a bunch of non-alcoholic beer and then pretend to be drunk and just kind of feel your way through and see how it goes.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
All great relationships start that way.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
People pretend to be drunk.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
What I would suggest is pretend like you read her mind.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And it's not that she was drunk, that you maybe saw a little insight there.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
But you can't use that information because you stole that information from her.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Travis is suggesting a mind freak.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, the mind freak.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You got a mind freaker.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
So you're saying pretend to have extra sensory powers?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm saying pretend like you have this information, but you can't use the information.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
You can't go up to her and be like, hey, remember the other night when you were drunk?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
You can't ever use it.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
But maybe that bolsters your confidence and you can say, well, maybe it's time to ask her out.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
You acquired that information via telepathy.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Mind freaker.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
You can't drop a mind freak reference in the non-expect.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It's because she did not choose to give you that information.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You pried it from her mind using mental powers.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah, more or less.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Mind freaker and then you real freaked her.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
When you do pretend to be drunk, make sure you pretend to be super duper incapacitated drunk and not fun drunk.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Pretend to throw up on yourself.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, pretend to throw up on yourself, really commit.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Just put a back scratcher down your throat or something and whore fall over the floor.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And then I think this would be good.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Take off your clothes except for your underwear and start pretending to be a baby.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
Because if she tends to, like if she continues to tend to you even after you're like,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Pick me up! Pick me up!

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Like in a fake brief, like a BBD diaper.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
That's love.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
She's into it then.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
You will have cracked that case.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
You might be pushing the river there.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
You might be shooting the cannon indoors.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I think a little bit.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Just overdoing it a touch.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
But boy, she loves you.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
She'll take care of you after that or even look at you in the eye.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
To clarify, don't do anything.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Don't do anything.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
How do I make someone listen to me that doesn't want to or make them do something I tell them to do?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Kitty cat, Gmail.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
This is actually something I've been thinking about a lot lately.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
The difference between respect and fear and like the absence of those two things.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Like when you tell someone to do something, they're either going to do it because they're afraid of you.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Or because they want to make you happy.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
On some level.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Even if it's like a minor thing.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And this is where the telepathy comes in.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
You use your mind powers.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
You mind freak them and then they'll do whatever you want.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Travis, why didn't I just go to Jimmy John's and get you a turkey club?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Mind freak!

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I mind freaked you.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I mind freaked you into doing that for me. Thank you.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Where is my coleslaw?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I think you can't.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
You can't make anyone do anything.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
The only thing you can do is make someone want to do something.

08:07.000 --> 08:15.000
And if you first take an interest in that person and show them that you respect them and that you care what they think.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
Then they're going to be more inclined to listen to you, I believe.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
And also, as far as listening to you, picking your battles and stuff like that.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Not just being the person that makes a big deal out of everything.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Because then you're the boy who cried wolf and nobody listens to you.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
But if you pick and choose and you only fight the battles that you're willing to fight that are important to you, people will respect your opinion a lot more.

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
I also talk less because if it's a rarity, people will be like, whoa, everyone hush up.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
They say still waters run deep.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Do they say that?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
They say that.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
That might be among the things that you can say.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Maybe if you just said that.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Over and over and over again.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah, like long periods of silence punctuated by-

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
While holding yours and rocking back and forth.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
You know still waters run deep.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
What?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Did you say something?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
No.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
People will do things that you want them to do if they think that you're one bad decision away from murdering them.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I think that you can create a whole veneer for yourself.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
Oh, like a kitty cat, that girl we know who's always close to murder.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Just like a step away from murder.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
We should probably keep doing what she wants us to do for her.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Griff, do you have a Yahoo answer for me?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I have several.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Okay.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
We should explain.

09:44.000 --> 09:52.000
The Yahoo answer service allows awful people to have their questions answered by equally awful, sometimes slightly more awful people.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
And we like to comb that service and help those people even though they didn't ask for our help.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Let's charity.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Let's do one that's going to get us in the holiday spirit.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
This one was sent in by Matt Brooks.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Thanks, Matt Brooks.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
It's by Yahoo answers user, Taco B.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Who asks?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Ladies, X-mas gift?

10:17.000 --> 10:27.000
Ladies, if your sexual partner asked for you to walk on him with your high heels for Christmas and that's the only gift he wants this year, would you do that for him?

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
Would you step on his privates for him with your sexiest heels if he proved it does not harm him at all?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Man, I wish I could be there for that particular Mr. Wizard experiment.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Let's prove that high heels don't injure my genitals.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
I have empirical evidence that you stepping right on my balls with your sexiest heels.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
This is my hypothesis.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Not a scratch nor bruise.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I like that he clears up it's the only thing he wants for Christmas.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, I should hope so.

10:57.000 --> 11:07.000
You can't be like, I'd like you to crush my genitals with your sexiest heels and also a Kindle.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
I mean, this seems like kind of a shitty present.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, it is.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
By anyone's standards, like even if you're into this kind of thing, like even if you were the biggest like ball crush fan on the planet, this seems like...

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
And I am.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Not a lot of thought went into this.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
It's like Griffin really loves mixing bowls.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Let's get him a mixing bowl for Christmas.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
That's far too obvious.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
That's way too obvious.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You didn't think...

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
No heart, no love went into that decision.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
You know what I'm saying?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Like you've got to flip it on him.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Make him think that you're going to step on his balls for Christmas and then maybe like step on his butthole.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Like it's a new thing that he doesn't know about, but maybe he'll be just as big a fan.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Discovery.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
That's the real gift here.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
What she needs to do is Christmas Eve sneak into the room wearing a Santa suit and her sexiest heels.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And he's like asleep, right?

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
He's conked out, visions of sugar plums dancing in his head, and then she just crushes his balls.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And his sugar plums.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
And his sugar plums.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He just crushes his sugar plums.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
Do you think that he would have time to get aroused or do you think like your fight or flight would kick in?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Oh man, I would be out of...

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
There would be a Griffin shaped cloud in the bed.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It would be nice to know he's real though.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That kind of empirical evidence.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Maybe not.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
What if all eight of his reindeer like just went to town, just trampled your business?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Trampled your jingle bells?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Man, there's a lot of Christmas themed names for your testicles now that I think about it.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah, you'll be sorry that they stepped on your balls.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
I think that it's normal.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Is it?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It is.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
It's okay to ask, especially if your GF is cheap.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Man, she'll be stoked.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
What do you want?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah, I'll do that.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, I'll step on your balls.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Step on your balls right here, look.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Step on your balls.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
They should make a remake of Jingle All The Way.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Uh-huh.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Where instead of a young boy who wants a turbo man.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Uh-huh.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
It's like a creepy, pervy, seedy dude who just wants a ball march.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Just one ball march.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
We'll call it Jingle All The Way to the Emergency Room and an awkward conversation with your primary physician.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
That's good.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
There's an answer on this question that I really like.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Seedless Hamster who says, I hate the people who use Xmas instead of Christmas.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
That's your complaint, doc?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
That's your concern?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Pick your battles, dude.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I would argue in this case that XXXmas would be more appropriate.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
God, what a, people are, ugh, they're wretched.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
So let's move on to something more life-affirming, an actual listener writing in.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Since high school, none of my relationships have lasted longer than three months.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
After that initial honeymoon phase, the girl tends to lose interest in me and break things off.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Is there something I'm doing wrong?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Am I possibly being over-romantic?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Or are women just not interested in me after they learn more about me?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
What advice do you have on keeping the girl?

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Three months seems like a pretty good length for a relationship.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
You can get a lot done in three months.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
I would posit that maybe you're not really being yourself at the beginning of a relationship.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
So three months in, when you start being yourself, it's not the person that they fell for.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
So my advice would be, be yourself from the get-go.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
It sounds like, I think what Travis is saying, and this could be a distinct possibility,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
that you're too good at getting into relationships.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
Also, are you really, are you, this sounds like a long series of people.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Are you really into these girls?

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
Because what I'm getting the sense from you is that they leave you, and that's what's bothering you,

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
but not that you, like, I want to know where you're at with them.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Because it sounds like there's a lot of girls who are coming and going here,

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
and you seem more worried about how they perceive you than actually losing them.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
So maybe you weren't that interested in them.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
If you're so worried about how they're perceiving you and you're trying to be romantic,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
you're trying to keep their interest, that's a huge turn-off.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
Like, you know, being yourself and being relaxed with them is much more interesting and much more relaxing for them.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
If you're working hard, it puts them on edge, you know,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
because they never feel comfortable in the relationship either.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
That's good.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
It's a toughie, because without actually, without more information, knowing what,

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
but let me put it another way, you're not necessarily doing anything wrong.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
You know, if after three months someone decides, I don't want to be with this person anymore, then that's okay.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
Like, that's their right, but it's good for you because it's somebody who didn't want to, wasn't going to work out for you.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
You know, you can have infinity three-month relationships.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Have as many as you want to, and when it's right, she'll be in for the long haul.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
And honestly, if it doesn't pan out after three months, good for you because that is not, yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
You got out early under the wire.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, really.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
You got off pretty easy if it's not going to be the right person.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
It sounds like you're pretty economically knocking off dead ends.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Maybe it's not anything that you're worried about right now.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I think you're on the right path.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
I think if you really want to do something about it, like if it's become like a serious problem for you,

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
go like two years without dating anybody.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
And then after that, you'll just, you'll want anything.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You'll just want something.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
This took a weird turn.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You'll just want anything.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
You'll keep it like a precious flower that you tend to in your loneliness garden.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah, it should be a recipe for long-term relationship success.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Desperation.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
Starve yourself and give yourself like intravenous love, affection.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Hello, brothers.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
I have just recently made a Facebook.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
What are your guidelines for friending people?

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
Should I friend only my best friends, my friends, people that I've seen around but don't know too well, et cetera?

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Because I'm getting friend requests from people that I don't even know.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Jack from Michigan.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I collect people on Facebook.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
I have like a collection, like stamps or, you know, like preserved beetles,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
which I don't want people to get weirded out when I say that.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Maybe a little weirded out.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Now, you say you're having trouble getting into a relationship, Griffin,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
and you have a collection of preserved human beetles?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Well, that's, I mean, I'm starving myself, right?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Like I'm on that diet.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm on a cleanse.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
You're on a love cleanse?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm on a love cleanse.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
But when it's time to flip the script, like when it's time for me to flip my whole program on its ear,

18:36.000 --> 18:46.000
I've got like 1,800 preserved people that I can just like dive into like fucking Scrooge McDuck's money vault.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
You best believe, like joke now, but when I flip this fish.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Do you believe the humans encased in amber and just insert a straw and suck the marrow from them?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Just suck their love marrow out them.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Like, oh man, I can't wait.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
I haven't set a date for when I'm going to flip it and just get so right,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
but I think it's going to be February next year.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Valentine's Day.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I like it.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
I keep a pretty tight ship of people that I, here's my rule of thumb.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
If someone were to tell me what they were doing that day and I know them well enough

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
where that would be relevant, interesting relationship information for me, then I would friend them.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
But if it's just going to be like just a stream of people saying inanities that only means things to them

19:36.000 --> 19:44.000
and people who know them better than I do, or super Jesusy, then they're not going to be friended.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
And by super Jesusy, I mean just it's Facebook, man.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
It's Facebook.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Just chill out.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Talk about the cool sandwich you had or something.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
I have a similar, like I'll add anybody, right?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Anybody who sends me a friend request.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah, fuck it.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
I'll add them because of the people vault.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
But the first, like if I see someone who's like Jubaama, I'm like, you're done.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
You're so done.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
You're out.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
What does that even mean, Jubaama?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Think about the things you're saying before you put them on the internet.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
You're gone.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
People don't, people don't, people don't think before they post.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
They're not, they're not considering the repercussions of their actions.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
They're just shouting into the ether.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
But that's what, that's what the internet is, right?

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
The internet is a thing that people can just shout whatever comes to, like whatever floats to the top of the garbage pile that is their mind.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And they just throw that on the internet.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
What's, what's crazy though is Facebook is like, it's a website where people you actually know,

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
like exclusively people you actually know can see like the garbage that you think and put on the internet.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
That's what Twitter is for.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
There's no censorship there.

20:56.000 --> 21:04.000
My, my only problem with Facebook is I honestly don't care if you want to post your random rantings about various things.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
Just don't fool yourself into thinking other people care about what you think.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
Like you can throw that out there, but no one's going to respond to it unless it's to say that you're dumb.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Otherwise, just keep that shit to yourself.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
You're not going to change anyone's mind because of something you posted on Facebook.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
I feel like there's so many needs to come up with some kind of, I don't know, protocol.

21:27.000 --> 21:35.000
Some kind of like, like, like a Facebook cotillion where people can learn the right and wrong things to do.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Like Emily posts.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
What's that?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Like Emily post for, for Facebook.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I don't know.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Ms. Manners type Emily wall posts.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Hey, holy shit.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Wow.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
We're on something now.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Quick, quick.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Don't let this idea fire die.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Throw some Emily, Emily, Emily wall posts.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
What does she tell you?

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
What does she, what does she, what are, what are some of her key lessons?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Never post anything you wouldn't want your mom to read.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That's good.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Don't tag images of people that they're not actually in.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Unless it's the, my brother, my brother and me party.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Unless it's the, my brother, my brother and me party, which is now up to what, 12, 13?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I don't know.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Monlock and his crew are repping the set.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Repping so hard.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Please spell check.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yeah.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
I don't want to have to, I know that it's very tempting to be like, it's snowing with like three W's.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Just stop it.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I know.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm here too.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I've heard about this.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
And by the way, if you see snow, it's snowing all over the world.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
So we all know.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah, we're all right there with you.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
We're all there in that boat.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
No cryptic posts about how heartbroken you are.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Like, I can't believe you hurt me like this.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Dot, dot, dot.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
I'm okay with those.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
I fucking drink those up.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, the ones that are like missing you.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Dot, dot, dot.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I sustain myself on people's anonymous sadness.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Like, yes.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
What I always can see is this is always the chain you see.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I can't believe you've done this, you monster.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
And then right after it, ten seconds later, a concerned friend is like, oh my God, what happened?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Is it Jeff?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Is he okay?

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
And then she's like, my TiVo didn't record Real Housewives of Orange County.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
It's not as big a deal because this is a good sort of rule of thumb.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
Maybe not for Emily Walpost, but if you are able to post on Facebook.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Shit ain't that bad.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Shit's pretty good for you.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Shit's pretty good for you.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
Like, by the virtue of the fact that you are posting on Facebook, shit's okay.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
You are okay.

23:43.000 --> 23:51.000
If you are listed as being in a relationship and it's complicated, go fuck yourself in the neck.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
That's a shitty thing.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Like, I'm in a complicated relationship with this very person.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
First of all, that could mean anything.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Second of all, you're just airing your dirty laundry.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
That seems equivalent to like, I'm in a relationship and we're having some problems.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Especially when it changes.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
That's my status.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
When you're in a relationship and then it goes to, it's complicated.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
It's like, oh, this is really weird.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
This is complicated.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Hey guys, we're having a really brutal fight.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
She hates my parents.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
They should have an option on the ropes.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Down for the count.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Down for the count.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Swirl in the drain.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh no.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
TKO.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
There's a whole spectrum of things.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Like, friends with benefits.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
If we're going to do this, let's do it right.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Just making my parents mad because he's black.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Experimenting.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
There's lots of different options.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Trying something new.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Saying this person is my wife, but really, they're just my best friend.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Ha ha ha.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Ha ha ha.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Cortisol.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Those are always the ones that piss me off.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Total beard.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
People that are like, she is married to her.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
They're best friends.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
God, I hate that.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
Can't you wait until Facebook status is our law?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
In the future, there will be no wedding ceremonies.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It's just like you change your Facebook status.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
So all those people are like, oh shit, I married Susan.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I've been dating.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
This is another city of love.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Relationships dating and marriage.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
I've been dating my girlfriend over two years and I wanted to get her a ring for Christmas.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Not an engagement ring.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
My co-workers say this is a bad idea.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
How bad could it be?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Ha ha ha.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
So bad.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Never, never ask that question.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
That's how bad could it be?

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Like if you end an idea with that, the answer is almost always like so bad.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
It's so bad that your Facebook status is going to change to it's complicated the day after.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
December 26th.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
And I'll be the one clucking my tongue saying, bitch, we try to tell you, don't do that.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
That is a bad idea.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
That's a bad idea.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Anything but a ring.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Like a necklace.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
A ring holds too much significance.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
Or, or, sack up and propose to her.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Oh my god.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Yes.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
This is what we're doing now.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
This is our Christmas Eve.

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
The thing about a ring is maybe back in the day where all engagement rings were so cookie

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
cutter, right?

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
There was a gold band and then a diamond on the end of it.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Right?

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
But nowadays people are like going to those 25 cent like gotcha gotcha machines and like

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
buying rings and like it's so romantic.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
This is from the arcade where we met.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Now we're married.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
Uh, that any ring you give her for like us, even a split second in her mind, it's going

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
to be like this ring has Spiderman's face on it.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But like, is that anything?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
I think he's just been listening to too much Beyonce.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Like he likes it.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
He does.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
He does like it.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
So he thinks he should put a ring on it, but he doesn't understand.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
There's a symbolism being referenced in that song.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
It's about, it's about getting engaged.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Um, let me, let me walk you through this.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
I'm going to, since if you're not getting it, I need to like break it down profiler

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
for you.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Here's what's going to happen.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
You, uh, hopefully standing or seated, not kneeling.

27:25.000 --> 27:34.000
Uh, you give her this ring, this, this Christmas ring and she opens it and for a hot second

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
she thinks she's getting engaged that day.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
Her mind fills with the visions of the wedding she's dreamed of since she was just a little,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
a little tyke.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
And then you tell her just a ring.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Yeah.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
There's an, and it may be a very nice ring, but she's going to instantly not like it

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
very much.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
She'll always think of it as my disappointment ring.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
How about flip side, flip side.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You've only been dating two months.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
She opens up the box.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Oh shit.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I'm so not ready to get engaged.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh cool.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It's just a regular ring.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
That sucks for you though.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Cause you're going to catch that look on her face.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Lie to me style.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
It's, it's been two years split second frown.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
It has been two years.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Oh, it says two years, doesn't it?

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
How about a big four knuckle ring that covers the entire front of her hand that says not

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
what you think.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
And so she opens it up and goes, then what is it?

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And you say, it's just a big ring.

28:35.000 --> 28:42.000
That's great because she can use that as brass knuckles to punch you in your Christmas balls.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And maybe that's his fantasy.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
She'll save some money.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Everybody wins.

28:47.000 --> 28:55.000
Listen, we have a, normally when like the steam runs out on a gag, we tend to move on

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and sort of hop, skip and jump to the next question.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
When the comedy juice has been extracted for a particular question, I'm going to really

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
take a step back here and say, like, don't do that.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Don't do it at all.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Please don't do that.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Like, this is a serious request from your friends.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I'd rather move over to me.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Don't do that.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
There will be that half second and you will ruin her Christmas.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Maybe even subconsciously, but there will at least be a hitch in her giddy up, a pause

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
in the air where something's going to have to be clarified, especially after two years.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
A hitch in her giddy up?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
That's a thing.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Are you 80?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Yes, I am.

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
Um, if after two years she's thinking it, so like she's on the lookout.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Right.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Right.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Or I like this.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I like Trapp's idea.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I do.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Just propose.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Just go ahead and fucking do it.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Make it magic.

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
Think about how magical that could be.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh man.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Christmas lights twinkling.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Think about it, but like, don't do the other thing.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
No, don't do that.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Maybe do the engagement thing like soup, like don't do it.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Okay.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Don't do it.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
How about a Yahoo?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Well, I just wanted to touch real quick.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Okay.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
If you have other Christmas questions, send them in.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
We're doing an all holiday show next week.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Ramadan.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
What?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
No, not Ramadan.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Yeah.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Ramadan.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Okay.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Eff it.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Ramadan.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Right.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
If you have a question, we'll be all the way at the end of the show.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.520
Make sure to include not only your question, but if you have any family traditions, anything

30:32.520 --> 30:35.200
like that, we'll talk more about it later.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.640
Also with pagan witchness.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.040
We forgot pagan witchness.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.040
Yes.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.040
Winter solstice.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.040
Yeah.

30:41.040 --> 30:45.760
If you have holiday traditions, send them in to us and we'll tell you if they're weird

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
or not.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.700
Which they probably are.

30:48.700 --> 30:52.760
If it includes stepping on balls with sexy high heels, bad news.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.760
Yeah.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.840
Send that to my personal address.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.600
Griffin hit me with a Yahoo?

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
Sure.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.040
This one is sent in by Modest Madison.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.040
Thank you, Modest Madison.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.120
Thank you, Modest Madison.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.560
This is by Yahoo Answers user Dearest Love, who asks,

31:05.560 --> 31:06.960
friend might be a robot.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.160
Help.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.160
OK.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.400
So my best friend of 15 years might be a robot.

31:13.400 --> 31:17.040
She beeps and boops and has a crazy phobia of water.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.400
And sometimes she spazzes out like a machine overheating.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.200
Should I confront her and be like,

31:22.200 --> 31:24.680
I think you might be a robot, or leave it alone?

31:24.680 --> 31:26.480
Help.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.680
Now, listen, straight up, everyone's immediate reaction

31:29.680 --> 31:31.400
is going to be to mock this person?

31:31.400 --> 31:32.760
No, no, no.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.800
Yeah, what the fuck?

31:34.800 --> 31:35.320
What if?

31:35.320 --> 31:36.400
It's an epidemic.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.960
Yeah.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.920
This is what I'm saying.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.680
If we don't listen to these people,

31:40.680 --> 31:43.240
we are losing our first line of defense.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.320
This is how they get us.

31:44.320 --> 31:44.820
Yeah.

31:48.920 --> 31:54.320
When someone someday has a friend who is secretly a robot,

31:54.320 --> 31:58.040
when they come, and they will, there's

31:58.040 --> 31:59.120
going to be at least one.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.320
It has to start somewhere.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.840
That's what I'm saying.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.440
Like, there has to be a first.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.480
And everyone thinks it's going to be Will Smith who's

32:05.480 --> 32:07.880
going to be that person who flips it.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.040
But I think it's going to be people like you and me

32:10.040 --> 32:11.520
and Dearest Love.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.160
Yeah.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.660
Let's get the conversation started.

32:14.660 --> 32:18.680
Here's a response by Yahoo Answers user James, who says,

32:18.680 --> 32:21.680
splash her with water and be like, oh, sorry,

32:21.680 --> 32:23.040
I thought you were a robot.

32:23.040 --> 32:28.280
If she dies, if she dies, she was a robot.

32:28.280 --> 32:28.780
OK.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.320
Fundamental problem right here, people

32:30.320 --> 32:32.040
aren't using their fucking noodle.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.920
If she's a witch, she'll die too.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.080
Yeah, think about that.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.680
What's up, mind freak?

32:37.680 --> 32:43.640
The preferred response here is to close her off

32:43.640 --> 32:48.160
in a room with no access to electricity or food or water

32:48.160 --> 32:50.760
for two weeks or three weeks.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.280
And then if she is able to, if she dies without electricity.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.240
Robot.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.120
Or food or water.

32:57.120 --> 32:57.960
She's a robot.

32:57.960 --> 32:58.600
Yeah.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.960
That's science.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.920
You could ask her to divide by zero

33:03.920 --> 33:05.680
to see what that does to her noodle.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.280
Oh, shit.

33:06.280 --> 33:06.680
Yeah.

33:06.680 --> 33:07.000
Yeah.

33:07.000 --> 33:07.500
Oh, yeah.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.600
You've got to pose a logic puzzle to her.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.160
Yeah.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.800
Like, could God make a rock so big that he couldn't move it?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.000
Yeah.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.720
If it's a religious robot, I guess,

33:16.720 --> 33:20.560
and not a religi-bot.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.000
I'm Bible-y, the Bible-bot.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.680
I know all the verses.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.880
What if you were to say, hey, pi.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.060
What was pi again, that number?

33:30.060 --> 33:31.960
And then try to remember it.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.480
And if she goes any more than four or five digits,

33:34.480 --> 33:36.160
I'm going to go ahead and call robot.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.840
Well, she might have that Rain Man thing.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.320
Oh, fuck.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.640
Is Rain Man a robot?

33:39.640 --> 33:40.720
Yes.

33:40.720 --> 33:44.340
That would be so much better now.

33:44.340 --> 33:46.000
Ask her to watch AI.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.720
And if she enjoys it, she's a robot.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.160
Rain Man is basically Minority Report now.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.720
It's like Minority Report prequel if you think about it.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.400
God damn, but people are stupid.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.520
Like, wow.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.480
It's getting bad out there, guys.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.840
It's getting rough.

34:04.840 --> 34:05.640
Yeah.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.360
I got a lot.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.080
This was a really bad week for just questions

34:09.080 --> 34:11.720
that are just the dumbest, like the dumbest people.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.840
Like the dumbest, just the dumbest people on the planet.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.240
I need to recalibrate here.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.360
MBMA, I'm tired of where I live.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.960
I want to pack my bags and move away

34:20.960 --> 34:23.800
while I'm still young enough for it to be feasible.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.160
I don't know if I should work towards moving to Los Angeles

34:26.160 --> 34:27.080
or New York.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.600
What do you suggest, aimless actor?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.800
I suggest getting a job.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.800
Nah, fuck it.

34:32.800 --> 34:33.760
Get a real job.

34:33.760 --> 34:34.760
Yeah.

34:34.760 --> 34:35.360
No, no, no.

34:35.360 --> 34:40.880
I think he's saying LA or New York.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.200
So between those two?

34:42.200 --> 34:42.920
Neither.

34:42.920 --> 34:45.720
You should go to Chicago or Miami or Utah.

34:45.720 --> 34:48.000
Really?

34:48.000 --> 34:48.760
Yeah.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.000
Utah Shakes.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.840
Huge theater company there.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.120
Also, Canada.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.840
A lot of movies are being filmed in Canada these days.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.680
If you can go to like Montreal or Winnipeg,

34:58.680 --> 35:00.840
there's a lot of movies being filmed up north.

35:00.840 --> 35:01.800
Vancouver.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.840
Vancouver.

35:03.840 --> 35:12.040
I just want to put in a hearty warning against Los Angeles.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.760
I know very few people who have moved there

35:14.760 --> 35:17.440
and want to continue living there.

35:17.440 --> 35:23.280
And I understand like City of Dreams and stuff, whatever.

35:23.280 --> 35:26.880
But man, I don't like Los Angeles.

35:26.880 --> 35:31.480
The thing is those two cities are like the tourist attraction

35:31.480 --> 35:33.040
of acting.

35:33.040 --> 35:37.600
Everybody shows up to a place like Orlando

35:37.600 --> 35:39.400
and wants to go to Universal Studios

35:39.400 --> 35:43.400
and to Disneyland for the traditional Florida

35:43.400 --> 35:44.280
experience or whatever.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.920
But there's so many other fun places

35:46.920 --> 35:49.280
to go where there's not as big crowds.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.400
It doesn't cost as much to go there.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.320
You're saying they should look for the Dollywood of acting,

35:56.320 --> 35:56.840
right?

35:56.840 --> 35:57.320
Yeah.

35:57.320 --> 36:00.400
Honestly, find the place that's right for you.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.800
Don't just go to New York or LA because that's

36:02.800 --> 36:04.680
where you feel you have to go to work.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.640
Can I suggest Dollywood?

36:06.640 --> 36:07.120
Yeah.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.320
I'm sure they have some kind of dance ensemble.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.880
There are so many people there trying to be famous.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.240
Like so many.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.520
And I get that.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.080
I get it.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.920
New York, things are happening.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.720
Like it's an exciting place.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.280
LA, I don't know.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.600
I don't get it with LA.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.240
But stick with New York.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.520
New York, there's a lot of stuff going on.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.760
But there are so many people there trying to eat your lunch.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.120
Don't you want a place where you can just have your lunch

36:34.120 --> 36:37.600
in peace and quiet?

36:37.600 --> 36:39.600
You may have less of a chance of getting

36:39.600 --> 36:44.760
super omega famous in a regional theater situation.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.800
But you'll be able to make a living acting.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.840
And if that's what you really want,

36:49.840 --> 36:52.520
then maybe explore some of those options.

36:52.520 --> 36:57.520
If anything, it's more important in your chosen field

36:57.520 --> 37:01.640
of profession that you make contacts, make connections.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.600
And if you roll up to LA or New York

37:03.600 --> 37:05.960
without any connections or contacts,

37:05.960 --> 37:08.080
then you are just like the tens of thousands

37:08.080 --> 37:10.960
of people that roll up to LA and New York every day.

37:10.960 --> 37:15.600
If you work in smaller markets at first,

37:15.600 --> 37:16.880
you'll meet more people.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.320
You'll make those contacts.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.920
And you won't just be showing up blindly with a suitcase

37:20.920 --> 37:23.600
saying, I'm ready, world.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.640
Be prepared.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.160
Have all the tools at your disposal ready to go.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.760
Don't just roll up expecting someone

37:29.760 --> 37:32.120
to point at you and say, you, you're

37:32.120 --> 37:34.560
exactly what I've been looking for.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.480
I'm Mr. Universal.

37:36.480 --> 37:42.760
It's a long process, and you can't be one of the lead chorus

37:42.760 --> 37:45.320
members in your local community theater's production

37:45.320 --> 37:47.320
of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat

37:47.320 --> 37:49.240
and then be like, made it.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.400
What's next?

37:50.400 --> 37:52.280
The silver screen.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.520
It doesn't work like that.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.940
When my friends and I talk about games and movies and the like,

37:58.940 --> 38:01.320
I tend to notice a lot of them say things that are just

38:01.320 --> 38:02.280
downright wrong.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.380
I'm a sponge, so I know a lot of useless facts about stuff.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.440
So sometimes I feel like I should correct them.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.200
However, when I do this, I feel like a grade A jerk.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.960
Is it better to just go on pretending

38:12.960 --> 38:14.520
what they said was right, or is there

38:14.520 --> 38:17.400
a way to inform them without being pompous and rude?

38:17.400 --> 38:18.720
Is there a way to correct someone

38:18.720 --> 38:22.280
without making yourself look like a know-it-all douchebag

38:22.280 --> 38:23.720
sad in New Jersey?

38:23.720 --> 38:25.120
Aw.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.680
Why is he so sad?

38:26.680 --> 38:27.560
Why are you sad?

38:27.560 --> 38:28.480
I don't understand why that question is so sad.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.320
Because he's in New Jersey.

38:30.320 --> 38:33.720
And he's a sponge, which is got to be rough.

38:33.720 --> 38:38.160
I have 100% definitive answer for you.

38:38.160 --> 38:45.160
You should not, when possible, you should not correct people.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.080
Ever.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.640
Ever.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.440
Think about the logic of the situation.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.840
Someone says something wrong, right?

38:50.840 --> 38:58.000
Someone says Mr. 500 or Mr. 5,000.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.480
What's that Bernie Mac movie?

39:00.480 --> 39:01.760
Mr. 3,000.

39:01.760 --> 39:05.000
Mr. 3,000 starred Cedric the Entertainer.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.920
No, of course it didn't.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.840
And you know that.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.800
Deep down in your heart, you know that.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.400
But someone says it.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.800
If you say, no, you're wrong, it was Bernie Mac,

39:16.800 --> 39:20.560
then you might feel a little better about yourself

39:20.560 --> 39:21.280
for a second.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.920
But that person's going to be embarrassed,

39:22.920 --> 39:25.040
and they're going to think you're a jerk.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.240
Best just to keep your mouth shut.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.080
Because this conversation happens

39:29.080 --> 39:31.680
during your monthly meeting of the Bernie Mac fan club.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.440
And he's going to have fucking scrambled eggs

39:34.440 --> 39:35.680
all over his face.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.120
And you did that to him.

39:37.120 --> 39:37.840
You did that.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.280
You can't wash that away.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.000
I mean, you can.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.800
But it'll take longer than you think.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.840
If you need to correct someone, if you must,

39:46.840 --> 39:49.800
if it's a situation where their misconception could

39:49.800 --> 39:51.360
be damaging or could have some effect,

39:51.360 --> 39:56.040
it's not just a bunch of people shooting the shit.

39:56.040 --> 39:56.760
Put it this way.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.320
I may be wrong.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.160
I frequently am.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.560
But I think, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.440
Yeah, something like, are you sure?

40:04.440 --> 40:06.640
Or I don't know if that sounds right.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.480
But you don't want to jump on them and be like, wrong.

40:09.480 --> 40:13.440
Or you could just pull them aside and be like, listen,

40:13.440 --> 40:16.240
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of the rest

40:16.240 --> 40:16.720
of the club.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.840
But I believe you meant to say Bernie Mac

40:18.840 --> 40:19.920
when you said that.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.240
It's a common mistake.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.720
They were in a lot of shared movies.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.760
I think what you want to ask yourself

40:25.760 --> 40:27.160
is, is this something that's going

40:27.160 --> 40:28.960
to continue the conversation?

40:28.960 --> 40:30.920
Or is this something that's going to awkwardly

40:30.920 --> 40:32.880
end the conversation because I just called out

40:32.880 --> 40:34.880
this person for no reason?

40:34.880 --> 40:38.600
If you guys are having a debate about Tom Cruise movies

40:38.600 --> 40:40.680
and somebody brings up a movie that he wasn't in

40:40.680 --> 40:43.960
and you want to continue on the conversation, great.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.800
But don't just be a douchebag and correct your friend.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.760
Why would they be talking about Tom Cruise movies

40:48.760 --> 40:50.760
during their Bernie Mac fan club meeting?

40:50.760 --> 40:51.680
It's a great question.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.920
Well, they had to share the hall because it was double booked.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.940
You need to get used to the satisfaction of knowing

40:58.940 --> 41:02.640
you're right without forcing everyone else to acknowledge

41:02.640 --> 41:05.200
that, unless you are Bernie Mac.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.560
Unless you are Bernie Mac.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.360
And then it's like, I told you I would be back from beyond.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.600
What?

41:15.600 --> 41:16.960
Say it.

41:16.960 --> 41:17.800
I forgot.

41:17.800 --> 41:21.400
It really exited my mind and it entered and left really

41:21.400 --> 41:22.160
quickly.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.480
That's like Bernie Mac in this world, right?

41:24.480 --> 41:27.520
Is that a metaphor for how he left us too soon?

41:27.520 --> 41:28.240
I remember now.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.960
I had a great idea.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.600
What if you did the exact opposite of what we're saying?

41:32.600 --> 41:33.160
OK.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.720
I'm not saying that you correct everyone all the time, right?

41:35.720 --> 41:37.000
Not in the middle of conversation.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.440
So maybe this is a polite way to handle it.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.080
I don't know.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.280
Nobody's done it before.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.840
This is untreaded ground.

41:42.840 --> 41:43.800
OK.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.200
What if you published your own daily newsletter

41:47.200 --> 41:49.080
that you distributed to your friends, right?

41:49.080 --> 41:50.000
But it's not news.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.480
It's corrections only, right?

41:52.480 --> 41:56.040
So every time anyone says any wrong shit,

41:56.040 --> 41:59.680
which it sounds like happens a lot in your group of friends,

41:59.680 --> 42:03.240
you just send out this newsletter like,

42:03.240 --> 42:09.240
you said George Lopez, but you meant George Lucas.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.680
That one was on Tommy.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.760
Tommy said that at 322 PM on Thursday.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.680
Star Wars would have been better, at least

42:16.680 --> 42:19.040
the first thing.

42:19.040 --> 42:22.240
I'm not convinced that Phantom Menace wasn't written

42:22.240 --> 42:25.160
and directed by George Lopez.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.480
Because you weren't fucking chortling the whole way

42:27.480 --> 42:28.680
through, that's how you know.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.160
Should you wait and collect this newsletter

42:31.160 --> 42:33.760
throughout a given day or week, or should it

42:33.760 --> 42:35.920
be like someone says something wrong, and you stand up

42:35.920 --> 42:38.960
and walk out of the room?

42:38.960 --> 42:40.440
Where's he going?

42:40.440 --> 42:41.920
He's going to his printing press.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.680
You said something stupid.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.200
He'll be back in just a moment.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.040
Or maybe there's, I don't know, maybe that's something

42:50.040 --> 42:51.640
you could use Facebook for, right?

42:51.640 --> 42:54.520
And tag everybody who said some wrong shit.

42:54.520 --> 42:58.440
No, it's a printing press or nothing.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.520
A handset type printing press.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.560
An old school Gutenberg.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.960
I want you to fucking mimeograph their mistakes

43:06.960 --> 43:09.760
and rub it in their faces with a purple ink.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.520
You need to come back out with like arm garters

43:12.520 --> 43:16.440
and an old-timey apron and your hands covered in ink

43:16.440 --> 43:19.240
and just say, yeah, I like all this.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.080
Here's your newsletter, stupid.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.720
Now, is this something we could charge for?

43:21.720 --> 43:23.880
Is this something that people would purchase?

43:23.880 --> 43:25.360
I think if I was wrong about something

43:25.360 --> 43:26.600
and someone wrote a newsletter about it,

43:26.600 --> 43:27.880
I probably would want to pay to read it.

43:27.880 --> 43:29.400
I would pay for that privilege.

43:31.720 --> 43:32.960
Gervin hit me with a Yahoo.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.960
I feel like we need to get another Yahoo in here

43:34.960 --> 43:36.500
before we wrap it up.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.280
Okay.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.200
We're probably going a bit long here, but so what?

43:41.200 --> 43:45.120
How about, you know, I've got two

43:45.120 --> 43:46.500
that I'm debating between, but I don't know

43:46.500 --> 43:47.680
that either of them will start

43:47.680 --> 43:48.980
a particularly good conversation.

43:48.980 --> 43:50.920
So what if I just did both of them

43:50.920 --> 43:53.840
and we just did like two minute, like sliders, right?

43:53.840 --> 43:54.680
Right, okay.

43:54.680 --> 43:56.080
I'm excited, okay.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.720
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers,

43:57.720 --> 43:59.440
or by Wax Catharsis.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.680
Thank you, Wax Catharsis.

44:00.680 --> 44:04.100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Michelle H, who asks,

44:04.100 --> 44:07.600
I see these beautiful pictures of Vin Diesel on the net.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.560
However, when I try to find posters, dull, dull, dull.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.560
Where can I order a great Vin Diesel poster?

44:13.560 --> 44:16.280
Or is there a place that I can take a picture off the net

44:16.280 --> 44:18.200
and make it into a poster?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.760
No.

44:19.760 --> 44:24.760
If you go to my mbmbam.com and click the buy stuff link,

44:25.200 --> 44:28.680
we have a large selection of Vin Diesel posters

44:28.680 --> 44:29.520
that I think would be right up your alley.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.600
And not just Vin Diesel posters.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.040
I would say that these pictures,

44:33.040 --> 44:35.480
these high quality glossy JPEGs,

44:35.480 --> 44:38.160
these are beautiful pictures of Vin Diesel.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.960
Artistic, like should be in a museum.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.440
Botticelli-esque pictures of Vin,

44:43.440 --> 44:46.160
just this is a gorgeous piece of art that we got.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.200
You can tell that they're art

44:48.200 --> 44:51.720
because you can see a little pube, but not like all.

44:51.720 --> 44:55.380
Just a tasteful, like a really tasteful amount.

44:55.380 --> 44:57.640
A tasteful amount of Vin Diesel's pubes.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.440
And if that's not the name of this episode,

44:59.440 --> 45:00.600
I'll eat my hat.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.440
Oh.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.000
Here's the other one.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.320
Because I feel like that one's pretty much cast.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.680
Oh, this one was also sent in by Wax Catharsis.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.440
This is our Wax Catharsis blog.

45:13.440 --> 45:18.440
Yahoo Answers user Zandra asks,

45:18.720 --> 45:21.640
is it okay to call a baby girl Pootie Tang?

45:21.640 --> 45:26.640
My cousin LaShawn calls her daughter Arianna Pootie Tang.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.560
I tell her that Pootie Tang is another word for pussy,

45:30.560 --> 45:33.120
but she thinks otherwise and still calls her that.

45:34.360 --> 45:36.640
No, it's a hilarious, hilarious movie.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.480
Yeah.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.580
They're saying you're a baby, you make me laugh

45:39.580 --> 45:41.340
and you're underappreciated.

45:41.340 --> 45:42.180
Is.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.520
And you're written by Louis C.K.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.640
I don't think there's anything wrong with that,

45:45.640 --> 45:48.780
but to be fair, I also don't think there's anything wrong

45:48.780 --> 45:51.520
with little Pootie Tang growing up and killing her mom.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.660
So, yeah, there's that.

45:53.660 --> 45:54.680
She'll have deserved it.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.520
Yeah.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.920
Like, has that, has the word Pootie Tang been adopted

45:57.920 --> 46:01.280
by the consciousness of the world to mean pussy?

46:01.280 --> 46:02.360
See, that's the thing.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.540
No.

46:03.540 --> 46:04.380
Yeah.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.620
No, yeah, it's not a thing.

46:05.620 --> 46:06.680
I've never said that.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.800
It's a movie.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.120
It's not slang for a vagina.

46:11.120 --> 46:15.040
Not only a movie, but a movie that's like 12 years old.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.100
Yeah.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.560
Yeah.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.520
Yeah, I don't think you're right on this one,

46:19.520 --> 46:21.520
Yahoo Answers, I'm glad you're listening

46:21.520 --> 46:25.280
because I think, I may be wrong.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.560
I frequently am, but I don't think Pootie Tang

46:28.560 --> 46:30.160
is a name for a woman's vagina.

46:31.160 --> 46:33.060
Let me take you aside here.

46:33.060 --> 46:34.020
Come with me.

46:34.020 --> 46:34.860
Let's leave the burning back fan club.

46:34.860 --> 46:36.200
Let's dissect this word, right?

46:36.200 --> 46:37.020
Okay.

46:37.020 --> 46:39.080
Let's do this like, dictionary.com style.

46:39.080 --> 46:39.920
Okay.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.520
Pootie.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.360
Uh-huh.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.180
Pooh.

46:43.180 --> 46:44.020
I mean, that obviously has some kind of.

46:44.020 --> 46:45.120
That sounds like a fart.

46:45.120 --> 46:50.120
It sounds like something rectal, right?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.460
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

46:52.460 --> 46:54.160
And Tang.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.060
Delicious, refreshing.

46:56.060 --> 46:58.880
Also like, creepy 1970s.

46:58.880 --> 46:59.880
Space-centric.

46:59.880 --> 47:00.720
Yeah.

47:00.720 --> 47:04.480
Creepy 1970s slang for vagina.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.540
Okay, I guess.

47:06.540 --> 47:09.240
There's a lot of things going on in this word.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.760
So what you're saying is she's calling her daughter

47:11.760 --> 47:13.280
farty vagina.

47:13.280 --> 47:15.120
She's calling her daughter.

47:15.120 --> 47:15.960
Yeah, like.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.200
And if that's not the name of this episode.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.440
I don't.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.120
Or the name of my child.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.760
Yeah, I will name my child Pootie Tang

47:25.760 --> 47:28.120
and that will be their Christian name.

47:28.120 --> 47:30.440
And I will raise them to celebrate the winter solstice.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.620
Is there any other Saturday Night Live characters

47:32.620 --> 47:33.920
that we can name?

47:33.920 --> 47:35.600
Was Pootie Tang a Saturday Night Live?

47:35.600 --> 47:36.420
No, sir.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.260
It wasn't, was it?

47:37.260 --> 47:39.000
I'm thinking of, no?

47:39.000 --> 47:39.920
Yeah, it was just a movie.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
You're thinking of Mr. Bill,

47:40.920 --> 47:43.000
another great product by Capcom Mobile.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.720
What about Ladies Man?

47:45.640 --> 47:47.160
Ladies Man.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.060
Undercover brother.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.400
You guys are bigots.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.760
I've been doing this show with bigots for years

47:53.760 --> 47:54.720
and I had no idea.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.920
I grew up, I was reared with two bigots.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.840
No, no, no, okay, hold on.

47:59.840 --> 48:03.440
I think my racial tolerance is an inspiration.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.360
It's an inspiration, my racial tolerance.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.880
That I was able to grow up in the same household

48:06.880 --> 48:10.840
as you two bigots and still not see color

48:10.840 --> 48:12.840
in the manner that I do is,

48:12.840 --> 48:17.160
I don't think heroism is too strong of a word.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.920
It may be too weak, actually.

48:21.720 --> 48:24.400
So my brothers are bigots

48:24.400 --> 48:26.880
and I don't wanna do this shit anymore with them.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.240
Man, we can't wait to do that Christmas episode.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.200
There's a lot of warmth in here.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.040
There's a lot.

48:33.040 --> 48:38.040
It will be the most racially charged Christmas episode yet.

48:40.140 --> 48:41.880
Probably in history.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.780
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

48:43.780 --> 48:45.220
But before we wrap it up,

48:45.220 --> 48:48.080
a couple quick housekeeping notes.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.600
mbnbam.com is our website.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.420
mbnbam is the name of our Twitter feed

48:53.420 --> 48:54.680
if you wanna follow us there.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.920
We're coming up on 2,000.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.680
If you wanna order products from us,

49:00.680 --> 49:03.240
we have t-shirts and hooded sweatshirts,

49:03.240 --> 49:06.240
the proceeds from which go to Big Brothers, Big Sisters.

49:06.240 --> 49:09.520
You can get those at mbnbam.com.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.160
If you wanna get them by Christmas,

49:11.160 --> 49:13.080
you need to order in the next week.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.080
The 19th is the cutoff for those, I believe.

49:16.080 --> 49:16.920
Is that right, Griffin?

49:16.920 --> 49:17.740
18th or 19th?

49:17.740 --> 49:18.580
I have no idea.

49:18.580 --> 49:20.600
I do know that we only have a few sweatshirts left,

49:20.600 --> 49:22.040
a few hoodies left.

49:22.040 --> 49:22.880
Okay.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.680
And we have raised, well, you guys,

49:25.680 --> 49:26.800
we haven't done anything,

49:26.800 --> 49:29.200
you guys have raised almost $500

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
for Big Brothers, Big Sisters,

49:30.200 --> 49:32.360
which is amazing.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.640
That's enough to buy a Big Brother, right?

49:34.640 --> 49:36.080
Yeah, that is one Big Brother.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.440
If you buy a couple more,

49:38.440 --> 49:40.760
maybe we can get him some cool shades or something.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.160
That's what Big Brothers are supposed to do.

49:44.280 --> 49:47.920
So get on there, get the goods, get the merchandise.

49:48.840 --> 49:53.600
We've got a Flash Magic 8-Ball

49:53.600 --> 49:54.680
you can ask questions of.

49:54.680 --> 49:57.520
We've got forums that are still super active,

49:57.520 --> 50:00.440
lots of people talking about lots of crazy stuff on there.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.100
And Griffin and me and Travis dip in from time to time.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.260
If you want to play World of Warcraft with us,

50:10.260 --> 50:11.660
all our login info is there,

50:11.660 --> 50:13.520
so you can just come on over and say hi.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.040
Give us some buffs.

50:15.040 --> 50:15.880
God.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.480
I'm so sad.

50:18.480 --> 50:20.000
I know, I'm getting depressed too.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.060
Shit's real.

50:21.060 --> 50:22.760
Shit's real, though.

50:22.760 --> 50:23.760
Come get some buffs.

50:25.160 --> 50:26.000
You got a buff?

50:26.000 --> 50:26.820
Come get me.

50:26.820 --> 50:27.760
You got buffs.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.520
And that's it.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.040
We also have a voicemail, right?

50:31.040 --> 50:34.380
Yeah, it's at 203-MA-BIM-BAM-1.

50:34.380 --> 50:36.960
Yeah, call us and we don't play those on the show or anything

50:36.960 --> 50:39.120
but we listen to them if you need us, we're there for you.

50:39.120 --> 50:42.040
And all the ways to contact us are on the website.

50:42.040 --> 50:45.240
You can also send in questions through the website.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.360
It's all there, one stop shopping.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.200
It's nice.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.880
Yeah, and oh, we love it when people

50:50.880 --> 50:52.640
put up quotes from the show.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.700
Sometimes they ruin jokes, but that's okay.

50:56.700 --> 50:58.080
I don't mind so much.

50:58.080 --> 51:03.080
We got people spreading the word Oizilla, O-I-Z-I-L-L-A,

51:04.760 --> 51:08.560
out there spreading the word Michael Maney, as always.

51:08.560 --> 51:11.080
Yeah, some people put up some incredible fan art

51:11.080 --> 51:12.300
for Bramblepelt.

51:12.300 --> 51:15.160
Lot of people do, but thank you everybody

51:15.160 --> 51:20.000
who submitted your Bramblepelt illustrations.

51:22.060 --> 51:25.160
And that'll do it for us.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.680
Also, just to reiterate, we have the comedy show,

51:27.680 --> 51:30.120
the holiday show coming up, so yeah.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.720
It will not be a comedy show.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.120
No, it'll be super serious.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.800
Fucking super dour, like tune in.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.920
And racially charged.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.840
Really racially charged.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.520
That episode, unfortunately, is whites only, so.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.280
We're calling it White Christmas.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.280
It's called the Bim Bam's Christmas Show for White Kids.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.600
Oh God.

51:49.600 --> 51:52.600
Just kidding, anyone can get it.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.760
Just kidding, anybody can listen.

51:54.760 --> 51:57.760
Like we encourage whites to download it, but we can't.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.600
We can't.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.440
I would like to discourage white people

52:00.440 --> 52:02.440
from listening after I get it.

52:02.440 --> 52:06.320
So Griffin, we have one more question.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.640
Why don't you hit me?

52:07.640 --> 52:10.640
Okay, let's see.

52:10.640 --> 52:13.840
This one was sent in by Jairus Mitchell.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.160
Thank you, Jairus.

52:15.160 --> 52:18.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Glow, who asks,
