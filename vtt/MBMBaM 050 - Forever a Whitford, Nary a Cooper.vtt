00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:53.280
Another year older, but about 20 years wiser. It's my brother, my brother made 50th episode

00:53.280 --> 01:01.920
spectacular. This is our one year anniversary of bringing you, taking your questions,

01:01.920 --> 01:07.360
turning them alchemy-like into wisdom. I'm your host and oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.080
I am a co-host and middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:13.280 --> 01:21.120
I'm a permanent guest host and the youngest sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Hey guys,

01:21.120 --> 01:24.960
what do we got planned for this super special episode? Because I know this is the kind of thing

01:24.960 --> 01:29.920
that podcasts, they usually don't just let it, you know, sail by. They usually do something to

01:29.920 --> 01:34.800
commemorate. Yeah, well, I have gotten you this special presentation. If you guys will open your

01:34.800 --> 01:39.680
hands right now, you will see the gold watches that I brought you. I was wondering where that

01:39.680 --> 01:43.680
came from. Yeah, that's from me. And enjoy. If you see the inscription on the back,

01:46.320 --> 01:49.920
can you read it? Go ahead and read it out loud. I'm not embarrassed.

01:49.920 --> 01:57.600
Is this Sanskrit? I can't read this. No, you just turn it upside down. Oh, it says great job.

01:59.680 --> 02:09.440
It says, in quotes, time for laughs. And it's laughs with four Fs. That's what it says.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.840
So I got those for you guys. If you guys will look outside, you'll see my

02:13.840 --> 02:20.480
one year anniversary gifts. I got you both ping pong tables. Whoa, good purchase. Thank you.

02:21.520 --> 02:26.000
And if you guys will check your mailboxes, you'll have gotten the postcards telling you that I

02:26.000 --> 02:31.520
donated trees to Jerusalem in your names. They need trees so bad over here. They do. It's a

02:31.520 --> 02:36.960
treeless wasteland that where Jesus was born. That's why he hates trees. Hey, let's get into

02:36.960 --> 02:41.120
the questions. My girlfriend and I have been dating for seven months now, and we enjoy going

02:41.120 --> 02:45.440
out to eat every once in a while. The thing is, when we order the food, she takes it upon herself

02:45.440 --> 02:50.720
to order both her food and my food. At first it was kind of cute, but now it's really starting

02:50.720 --> 02:55.280
to bother me. Should I say something to her about it? Or is this one of those things I need to let

02:55.280 --> 03:01.840
go? Flustered in Florida. Wow, that's so weird. Yeah, I've never heard of that. That's not a thing

03:01.840 --> 03:07.040
that people actually do unless they're in like a movie. What if when she ordered your food,

03:07.040 --> 03:15.360
you just screamed, wrong. Close, but not right. Let's go with a steak. We were looking for

03:16.160 --> 03:21.520
steak. Maybe she really knows him really well. I would actually be a big fan of this. I hate

03:21.520 --> 03:25.360
deciding what to eat at a restaurant because I don't understand the big words. Like what's a

03:25.360 --> 03:32.720
gruyere? What's a gruyere? I think he probably like picks the food. I just think that like when

03:32.720 --> 03:38.880
the lady comes around, that she says like, he told me earlier that he wanted to have the steak

03:38.880 --> 03:45.760
and gruyere. So I'm going to order that for him. Maybe or maybe like really mean and she thinks

03:45.760 --> 03:49.680
like he's overweight and doesn't want to say anything about it. So she's like really passive

03:49.680 --> 03:55.520
aggressive. Like he'll have a salad. Yeah, I'll have the chicken corn on blue and Tubby Tubbs

03:55.520 --> 04:01.360
over there is going to have a shot of wheat grass and some disapproving looks. Somebody skipped his

04:01.360 --> 04:08.880
morning jog so he gets a mixed green. I think that you should probably ask out of curiosity,

04:08.880 --> 04:16.800
like very non nonaggressive. Hey, why do you do that? Why does that happen every time? Maybe

04:16.800 --> 04:21.680
there's a good loving reason for it. What could the loving reason be? Maybe you're really bad at

04:21.680 --> 04:25.520
like human interaction and she's saving you from having to make a fool of yourself in front of the

04:25.520 --> 04:30.880
waiter. Like she knows you're going to make terrible jokes about how you want your steak

04:30.880 --> 04:35.760
done or whatever. How do you want your steak cooked? On the grill. She's trying to prevent

04:35.760 --> 04:41.280
that from happening. My name is Fred and I'll be your customer this evening.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.360
Could you steak me?

04:50.240 --> 04:54.720
The first time you guys went out, did you embarrassingly order things like

04:55.280 --> 05:00.480
I'll have the hamburger because you hold the mustard and put the mayonnaise in a cup next

05:00.480 --> 05:04.080
to it and stuff like that. Maybe she just doesn't want to deal with your whininess.

05:04.080 --> 05:10.240
Bring me the mayonnaise in a stein if you could, please. I need a thimble full of vinaigrette.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.920
If I see a pickle, I'm going to burn this restaurant down.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.720
Sorry, Darlene. I think you should ask to find out what the reason is. If it's a good reason,

05:20.720 --> 05:26.320
it's not worth it. Does it really bother you? What you should do is just completely embrace this

05:26.320 --> 05:30.960
and when your lady orders for you, make eye contact with the waiter and just give a real

05:30.960 --> 05:42.240
slow nod. Yeah, like you're inviting him into your relationship. She was correct.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.400
Why don't you turn it into a contest where you tell her, listen, baby, I don't mind

05:48.400 --> 05:53.360
if you keep ordering for me, but I'm going to order for you. If I get to the waiter first,

05:53.360 --> 05:57.760
I'm ordering for you. It doesn't even have to be like that. You can be like,

05:57.760 --> 06:02.240
who knows the other person better? She'll order something for you and she'll be like,

06:02.240 --> 06:09.040
I think he would like the barbecue bacon onion burger from TGI Fridays. Then you'll be like,

06:09.040 --> 06:14.800
she'll have cookies. Sir, it's seven o'clock. I know for a fact she hasn't eaten dinner yet

06:14.800 --> 06:19.760
because she's at a TGI Fridays. I know what I said. She'll have the cookies, please.

06:19.760 --> 06:24.720
She'll have the cookies, please. And a bowl of croutons. I get a bowl of croutons,

06:26.240 --> 06:30.880
some of those cocktail swords. There's one thing I know about my girl and that she's

06:30.880 --> 06:39.360
got a big race coming up and she's got to carb. Got to carb up. Croutons, please. Just carb her.

06:42.080 --> 06:47.360
I don't have a feminine while. I'm not sure what happened. Please help me. How do I attain

06:47.360 --> 06:54.640
some feminine while skills? I'm a girl if that helps. It does. Yes. Yeah, certainly.

06:54.640 --> 07:00.000
Forgetting feminine while. Every woman has feminine while. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know

07:00.000 --> 07:04.560
maybe Stella got her groove back? Just go watch that and do exactly what Angela Bassett does.

07:05.760 --> 07:11.520
I don't think that it's something like, it's not like a list of things you know how to do.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.760
It's not like a skill you pick up at summer camp. It's just something like,

07:15.760 --> 07:22.720
that is the, that is a term that's used to describe like what women do in society.

07:22.720 --> 07:28.640
I have to ask, where did you acquire that knowledge? Where did you acquire that knowledge

07:28.640 --> 07:31.760
that it's not a thing that ladies learn at summer camp? Because I could totally see

07:32.720 --> 07:37.120
a lady going to summer camp and then that's when she learns how to fucking work it.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.160
Isn't that what finishing school is? Where they teach you how to fucking work it?

07:40.160 --> 07:46.240
So you're saying like in middle school when they separated like the boys and girls to watch

07:46.240 --> 07:49.920
different movies, the boys were off watching the Uncomfortable movie about pubic hair,

07:49.920 --> 07:53.040
but the girls were totally watching movies about how to like work it?

07:53.040 --> 08:00.000
The girls actually get a class by RuPaul who comes in and just teaches them how to work,

08:00.000 --> 08:04.880
you know, how to find their fears, how to find their bliss and just chase it, you know?

08:04.880 --> 08:12.080
Chase that bliss! We had to look at horrifying pictures that still haunt me to this day of

08:12.080 --> 08:18.240
vivisected cocks. Like this is, if you would lathe your cock, this is what it would look like.

08:18.800 --> 08:22.160
You just split it right down the middle, right down the prime meridian,

08:22.160 --> 08:26.320
and then they got RuPaul teaching them how to make it work.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.960
Exactly. That's bullshit.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.320
At the end there was like a fashion show on a catwalk.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.760
So maybe our, maybe our listener missed that day of school.

08:36.800 --> 08:42.000
Oh, were you sick? Were you sick that day on Make It Work Day?

08:43.520 --> 08:48.880
What was the name of that show that was on MTV that they taught the guys how to be like players

08:48.880 --> 08:53.360
and it was, but it was hosted by the guy who wore like goggles and like furry top hats.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.760
I think it's like the America's Next Great Pickup Artist, The Pickup Artist.

08:57.760 --> 09:04.880
The Pickup Artist. Yeah. Ma'am. What fucking douche chills I got. I had a winter of douche chills.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.520
How are you helping our writer?

09:07.520 --> 09:10.160
I'm saying that maybe you call that guy up and be like,

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
maybe he knows a thing or two about the lady game.

09:12.480 --> 09:12.800
Like how to make-

09:12.800 --> 09:16.560
He can never do that. He can never do it. He only knows how to work that system

09:16.560 --> 09:20.160
the one way. If he tried to see it from the other side, it would turn him gay.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.960
No, but this is like a, if like a, you hire a bank robber to do your vault security.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.840
Oh shit.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.960
I'm saying it was all about how to, how to pick it up.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.520
It is so much easier for girls though, right? Like guys takes,

09:33.520 --> 09:38.240
it takes whole reality shows to teach them how to work their, you know, how to work their something.

09:38.240 --> 09:43.120
Girls, like, didn't we establish like just flash a boob, right? Like you just-

09:43.120 --> 09:44.160
Well, don't do that.

09:44.160 --> 09:44.960
Don't do that.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.480
But you could.

09:46.480 --> 09:51.520
I think with guys, it's like, it's like teaching them an elephant how to paint. Like you can do it.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.080
It just takes a lot of work, a lot of commitment from the elephant.

09:54.080 --> 10:00.400
Ladies are like, like mad sexy. They're like super sexy. All of them, 100%.

10:00.400 --> 10:06.080
Guys, we don't have like, unless I'd blast my core, like Bradley Cooper style,

10:06.960 --> 10:11.760
unless me and Coop hit up the gym and do some yoga lattes and blast our pecs and cores,

10:11.760 --> 10:12.640
just wail on them.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.080
Or even Bradley Whitford style.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.200
See, that's my jam.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.120
I would take a Bradley Whitford core at this point.

10:19.120 --> 10:26.160
Forever a Whitford, Mariah Cooper.

10:26.160 --> 10:26.880
You monsters.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.840
So find RuPaul, pay top dollar. It's your fault you should have been absent that day.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.680
Covergirl, turn to the left.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.320
Griffin, hit me.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.840
All things, all things just keep getting better, you guys.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.480
Yeah.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.240
On this, our 50th episode.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.840
I have so many good ones. How about-

10:47.840 --> 10:50.400
Oh, this is good. This is an appropriate segue.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.720
This one was sent in by Cosmodoodlecat. Thank you.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.600
Okay.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bay Harbor Butcher.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.560
Oh, good.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.840
Who asks, who asks terrifyingly,

11:02.880 --> 11:07.040
I am thinking about doing this to 25 women this upcoming week.

11:07.040 --> 11:07.840
What?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.800
This can't end well for the Bay Harbor Butcher.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.000
I am trying to build my confidence so that I can start meeting women

11:14.000 --> 11:16.880
when I'm out and about like a store, for example.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.640
I usually find myself talking slash flirting with women when I'm out,

11:20.640 --> 11:23.680
but never know if I'm taking their kindness the wrong way.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.320
So I always end up just leaving without a number slash email.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.360
So this is my plan.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.400
I'm going to walk up to 25 women and say,

11:32.400 --> 11:35.440
hi, I just wanted to tell you that I think you're beautiful.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
Have a great day and walk away.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.240
How would you feel if some random guy did that to you?

11:41.280 --> 11:42.720
Additional details.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.680
Additional details.

11:43.680 --> 11:48.560
I'm okay looking, not a supermodel.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.760
Listen, hey, there's so many fallacies,

11:51.760 --> 11:55.520
so many riddled with plot holes, the question is.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.160
Let's start from the beginning,

11:58.160 --> 12:03.520
from the opening, some of the nomenclature misstep that you've made here.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.400
Bay Harbor Butcher?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
Like that's your line?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.280
That's your handle?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.000
It's your tag?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.200
It's this great face.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.000
Do you mind if I take it?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.840
I'm planning on doing this to 25 women.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.800
I'm going to chop them up and hide them around the city.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.760
Can you catch me?

12:19.760 --> 12:20.480
I don't think you can.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.560
Can I add you to Facebook?

12:22.560 --> 12:25.440
By which I mean the book that I'm making out of faces.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.640
I'm confused by his premise.

12:28.640 --> 12:34.080
His premise is that he often talks slash flirts with these women

12:34.080 --> 12:35.840
and leaves without getting a phone number.

12:35.840 --> 12:40.720
So his plan of attack is to leave without getting a phone number.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.000
Like what I'm going to try to do is make a conscious choice

12:44.000 --> 12:45.200
not to have any connection.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.040
You know when your dad catches you smoking,

12:47.040 --> 12:48.640
it makes you smoke a carton.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.920
He's trying to like burn himself out on failing.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.920
I'm not closing the deal.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.200
Just take a dip in the failure pond.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.320
What are you doing, dude?

12:59.600 --> 13:00.240
It's like-

13:00.240 --> 13:00.800
Sweet face.

13:01.360 --> 13:01.680
Dip.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.560
Gotta go.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.960
It's like Alec Baldwin said in that movie,

13:04.960 --> 13:07.600
A, always B, B, D, dipping.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.560
Always B, dipping.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.000
Dip.

13:10.000 --> 13:10.880
I'm out.

13:10.880 --> 13:14.480
See, I would take it one step further and just at a full run

13:15.120 --> 13:16.880
pass by these women and just go,

13:16.880 --> 13:18.000
you're really pretty.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.480
Good face.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.600
You're gone and you're out.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.920
Doppler dating is what we call it.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.080
We used to do that in our hometown of Huntington.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.680
I remember Justin introduced me to that game

13:29.680 --> 13:32.720
where we would drive around and yell things at people

13:32.720 --> 13:35.600
as we drove by and I had to stop playing that game.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.880
We would always nice things like,

13:36.880 --> 13:40.560
hey, cute face or hey, like you're jorts.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.560
But we had to stop playing that game or at least I did

13:42.560 --> 13:44.880
because there's nothing more infuriating

13:44.880 --> 13:46.720
than when people yell shit at you.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.040
Yeah, because you never assume it's nice

13:49.040 --> 13:50.000
and you can't make it out.

13:50.560 --> 13:55.600
You almost never can make it out and there's no recourse.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.200
There's nothing you can't be like,

13:57.200 --> 13:58.160
yeah, well fuck you too.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.000
Oh, you're gone.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.880
You already left.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.760
You're like in a car.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.760
You're like super far away.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.680
I think that everybody should just say nice things

14:05.680 --> 14:07.040
to everybody all the time.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.960
I think you can end your compliment

14:10.960 --> 14:13.040
as long as you say like, sorry, I'm a creep.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.320
Yeah.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.360
Sorry, I'm a creep-o.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.680
Well, that's actually something I've always wondered.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.560
Like when you see a girl with like a really nice haircut

14:20.560 --> 14:22.880
or something, but if you preface by saying,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.240
I'm not trying to be creepy, but you just made your hair,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.080
you just made your compliment so creepy.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.520
There needs to be a word for like a precursor

14:33.520 --> 14:36.880
that actually defines what you're about to say to somebody.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.640
Like a non-creepy, no homo.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.000
Like if you're like no creep and you said something.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.200
Like yeah, but one that doesn't make you sound like a douche.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.080
Like a douche.

14:46.080 --> 14:51.760
Like just creep warning to say.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.560
Creep alert.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.120
Creep alert.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.160
I'm about to creep you out.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.600
Yeah, that would be good.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.840
But there's gotta be something about it.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.440
Creep wise.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.480
Creep wise.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.600
No creeping.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.480
The problem with being a creep is that like drawing attention

15:07.120 --> 15:07.440
to what is creep.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.640
Just makes it even creepier.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.640
There's nothing you can do to uncreep something.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.720
Like once it's been creeped, it's like the taint.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.200
You know what I mean?

15:13.200 --> 15:18.160
It's like that virus that's killing all those bats in Ohio.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.720
Like once it's there, you can't get it off your nose.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.400
It's just gonna ruin the population.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.000
Because the more you try to justify it,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.600
the more creepy it becomes.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.000
Exactly.

15:26.000 --> 15:26.720
No, but I didn't.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.320
But I was just creepy.

15:28.320 --> 15:32.720
Do you know the only thing you can do is make it fucking work.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.000
Just make it do work for you.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.760
It's hard to do.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.560
I've never done it.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.160
Do as we say and honestly do here.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.040
If you crack this Da Vinci code, you let me know.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.560
Because I would love that.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.960
I'm filled with boundless love.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.720
And I would love to just come up to people on the street

15:48.720 --> 15:52.880
and be like, hey, you are just super attractive.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.440
Everything you're doing, yes, yes, and yes.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.320
Do you know how to make that work?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.200
How do you make it work?

15:59.200 --> 16:00.400
You'd be Bradley Cooper.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.000
You'd be super attractive.

16:02.000 --> 16:02.800
Fuck me.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.640
Hugely, hugely attractive.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.480
I was going down the list of features.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.600
I checked Whitford.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.560
I didn't check Cooper.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.760
Yeah, you gotta be careful.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.920
And number one, step one, don't refer to yourself

16:17.920 --> 16:19.200
as the Bay Harbor butcher.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.960
Like I don't think I can emphasize this enough.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.280
Hey, I'm from California and I recently enrolled in college.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.080
On the East Coast.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.760
I'm a big basketball fan.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.520
And by that, I mean baseball.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.160
Sorry.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.280
I'm a big baseball fan, specifically a Giants fan.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.640
And sorry, are you a big fan or a Giant?

16:36.640 --> 16:39.840
I recently had the pleasure of watching my team thrash

16:39.840 --> 16:44.560
my friend's team, the Paleys, in the North League Championships.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.440
I put this question in as a test.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.480
In the mountains of the North.

16:52.480 --> 16:57.440
Where we beat clan stock, the team of the North.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.520
Sadly, he is an uber sore loser to the point

17:01.520 --> 17:03.360
where shit talking is no fun.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.720
Now, when I talk shit, he just admits his team's failure

17:06.720 --> 17:08.160
and overall inferiority.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.600
This just makes me feel like an asshole.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.680
How can I talk shit and not feel like an asshole?

17:14.720 --> 17:16.640
What are you desperately seeing solutions?

17:16.640 --> 17:17.680
Like, what are you saying?

17:18.320 --> 17:20.080
How can I be a dick and not be a dick?

17:20.080 --> 17:22.560
Like, have you, wait, first of all, what?

17:23.120 --> 17:23.840
Okay.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.720
Do you not understand what an uber sore loser is?

17:26.720 --> 17:29.680
If you're like, your team lost and he's like, yeah, they did.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.520
That seems like a pretty good loser to me.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.200
I completely accept my team's failure.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.080
Oh, okay.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.520
No, he's like taking it so personally that he can't rip him.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.880
And what's that guy's deal?

17:40.880 --> 17:42.640
Like, hey, the Phillies suck.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.140
I know.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.120
I suck too.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.080
Everything sucks.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.000
I'm just a little bitch.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.280
I can't do anything right.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.640
You're stupid, Darren.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.640
This is exactly why Susan left me.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.000
This is why Susan left you.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.120
It's because of the Phillies.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.240
It sucks.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.200
Come back, John Krunk.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.040
Your friend needs to get some pride.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.920
I think you need, your operation needs to change.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.160
You need to change from a how do I be a jerk

18:06.160 --> 18:10.080
and get away with the operation to a let's build Darren up.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.080
Like, you gotta, if you care about Darren,

18:12.080 --> 18:15.600
and I know you do, you gotta start building up that confidence

18:15.600 --> 18:17.040
in both him and the Phillies.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.680
They don't need any help building confidence in the Phillies.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.280
The Phillies, I don't know if you guys know this.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.200
I know you guys aren't big baseball men.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.240
The Phillies, half robot, half of their league,

18:26.240 --> 18:28.720
half of their bench is robotic.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.400
Okay, so not like cyborgs, like half of them are 100% human.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.040
Okay, there's some mixies in there.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.640
There's some half and halves.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.000
Half robot, half human.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.720
Roy Halladay, 100% robot.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.160
He's actually a pitching machine,

18:42.160 --> 18:44.240
like one of those things that you see at batting cages,

18:44.240 --> 18:47.280
only they had a wizard cast a spell on him

18:47.280 --> 18:49.200
to make him look like a human being.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.520
It seems like there should be rules against that.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.480
There are rules against that.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.600
Phillies are cheaters.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.080
They live in a cheat city full of cheaters.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.440
Fuck the Phillies.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.240
So why is it that this guy is so down on his team?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.000
Probably because he hates robots.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.200
He knows that that's the future.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.440
The future is all 100% robotic.

19:05.440 --> 19:05.920
Oh, shit.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.600
He feels bad that he feels like a traitor to flesh men.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.360
Is that what you're talking about?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.560
Because he's a flesh traitor.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.280
He's a flesh traitor.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.480
He's a flesh traitor.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.520
Everybody should have been rooting for the Giants in that.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.000
Brian Wilson, the real American hero.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.720
He's not robot at all.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.880
I hope that our fans who also know anything about sports

19:26.880 --> 19:28.320
have enjoyed these past three minutes

19:28.320 --> 19:29.440
because that's all you're getting.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.440
We waited a year to give you this much

19:31.440 --> 19:33.040
and you've got to wait another year

19:33.040 --> 19:36.000
for three minutes of sports related riffing.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.440
I almost never want to ostracize

19:39.440 --> 19:42.560
entire just swathes of fans of our show.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.160
Like, I love everybody.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.480
But if you're a Phillies fan, you can go fuck off.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.280
Okay, good.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.560
Go find a different podcast.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.680
This one's not for you.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.000
Cool.

19:50.000 --> 19:50.640
Okay.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.000
I disagree with that.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.720
In fact-

19:52.720 --> 19:53.520
Robo-lover.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.160
Can I ask one of the two internal advice questions

19:58.160 --> 19:59.600
that I have for the show?

19:59.600 --> 19:59.840
Yeah.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.120
So this year, you know,

20:03.120 --> 20:05.600
this is my second year living in Cincinnati

20:05.600 --> 20:07.840
and I've decided to become a Reds fan.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.160
Yeah, you did.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.000
People have been giving me shit about that.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.920
I'm like, you can't just become a fan.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.040
Like, oh, you become-

20:13.040 --> 20:13.840
Why not?

20:13.840 --> 20:14.640
You absolutely can.

20:15.280 --> 20:15.520
Yeah.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.480
It's like, I live here.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.200
I'm going to follow it.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.720
It's not like I'm like rabid about it.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.000
I'm not going to like go around and be like,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.200
woo, Reds are the best.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.640
I don't know anything about baseball, but-

20:22.640 --> 20:24.880
Scraps, I think the problem you have is telling people,

20:24.880 --> 20:27.120
hey, I'm about to become a Reds fan.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.560
Coming up in a couple of weeks,

20:28.560 --> 20:30.480
I think I'm going to become a Reds fan.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.320
So look for that.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.280
Look out for that.

20:33.280 --> 20:38.640
It takes you a whole season of watching a ball organization

20:38.640 --> 20:41.120
to like really grok what their style is,

20:41.120 --> 20:42.400
to really grok their style.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.240
And after that, you can be like, I'm a fan.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.080
Like, I didn't give a shit about football

20:46.080 --> 20:49.200
until I moved in with a huge Packers fan this year.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.120
And so I started watching the Packers

20:51.120 --> 20:52.320
and then they won the Super Bowl.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.360
And now I'm a Packers fan,

20:53.360 --> 20:54.960
which makes me look like a shithead.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.360
Like-

20:55.360 --> 20:55.840
Yeah.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.360
But you had already picked your horse.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.400
I had already picked my horse.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.200
I had no idea what they were about.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.280
Dude, the same thing happened to me with the Red Sox

21:01.280 --> 21:04.000
with the first year that they won the World Series.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.440
I lived that summer with a really huge Red Sox fan.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.520
And then I was like, okay, now I like the Red Sox.

21:09.520 --> 21:09.840
And then-

21:09.840 --> 21:10.640
How are we-

21:10.640 --> 21:11.920
Everybody gave me shit.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.360
How are we not the most, like,

21:15.360 --> 21:19.280
the richest sports gamblers in the world?

21:19.280 --> 21:19.520
Yeah.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.840
Well, because I mostly just bet on golf.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.480
You're just a, you vote on McElroy.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.440
He's crushing it.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.320
He is crushing it.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.760
He's like 11 under.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.560
11 under on the 13th.

21:28.560 --> 21:29.680
Okay, that's all I can,

21:29.680 --> 21:30.560
I literally can't talk about sports anymore.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.840
And he's only 21.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.880
I'm dying.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.160
This is killing me.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.480
I was recently involved in a retail rage incident

21:36.480 --> 21:37.440
over a parking space.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.760
As it came to a head, it became very clear

21:39.760 --> 21:41.200
this man wanted to punch me.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.160
He didn't.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.200
But that didn't stop me from thinking

21:43.200 --> 21:44.320
about what I would do if he did.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.600
My first thought was to instantly kick him in the balls.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.960
But what do I do after that?

21:48.960 --> 21:51.120
Borderline beaten up in Baltimore.

21:51.120 --> 21:51.760
Good one.

21:51.760 --> 21:52.560
In Baltimore?

21:52.560 --> 21:54.560
See, they have a stellar baseball team.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.440
I swear to God.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.080
I swear to God.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.280
It'll be my brother and me.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.560
I just want to see it by Nickelodeon.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.600
I want to take a second.

22:01.600 --> 22:01.840
Okay.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.640
I want to apologize to people who live in Philadelphia.

22:04.640 --> 22:04.960
Okay.

22:04.960 --> 22:05.840
A little over the line.

22:05.840 --> 22:06.720
They're backpedaling now.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.960
Your baseball team is all chips and wires.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.080
And you know it.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.280
Um, a ball kick is a pretty good-

22:13.280 --> 22:15.280
I don't think that's a good opening salvo.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.280
Ball kick, the problem is you got 30 seconds

22:17.280 --> 22:18.640
where this guy could just wail on you

22:18.640 --> 22:20.000
before that catches up with him.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.360
Well, but also you gotta-

22:21.360 --> 22:22.080
Wait, hold on, hold on.

22:22.080 --> 22:22.320
Stop.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.160
30 seconds?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.560
That's how long it takes for pain signals

22:26.560 --> 22:28.080
to get from your balls to your brain?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.440
There's a- it's a delayed response.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.280
Have you not experienced this?

22:31.280 --> 22:32.720
A ball kick doesn't take-

22:32.720 --> 22:35.520
For me, it's like, it's like preeminent.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.440
Like, I see the foot coming towards my balls

22:37.440 --> 22:39.600
and I- I have phantom pains already.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.080
Like, I-

22:40.080 --> 22:40.800
There's a delay.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.000
There's a definite delay there.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.200
There are 30 seconds.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.760
How slow are your- your balls wires?

22:45.760 --> 22:46.320
What?

22:46.320 --> 22:48.560
My balls wires are so fat.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.440
Like, they're straight gold-plated wires

22:51.440 --> 22:52.560
that goes straight to my brain.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.120
Like nickel-cabbage.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.240
Oh, you got it.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.440
HDMI ball wires.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.480
I'm working with a T1 connection on my balls wires.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.040
I got a- my balls just got prodigy this year,

23:01.040 --> 23:02.560
so they're taking a long time.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.440
It's like 24 balls down there.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.480
Here's the thing to think about.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.960
It- you got to tell this story later.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.240
Do you want to be the dude who leaves off the story with,

23:12.240 --> 23:13.600
I kicked him in the balls.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.040
I kicked him in the nutsack.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.920
How often are you going to get to punch somebody

23:17.920 --> 23:18.880
full off in the face?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.040
I think that opportunity would be so rare.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.080
You should just grab it.

23:22.080 --> 23:22.960
I have never done it.

23:24.160 --> 23:24.880
I don't think I've never-

23:24.880 --> 23:25.760
I've never punched a-

23:25.760 --> 23:27.680
I mean, we played lockjaw before, but I've never-

23:27.680 --> 23:28.080
Yeah.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.480
I've never-

23:28.480 --> 23:29.600
Not like an anger.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.400
Not like an anger.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
You just punch somebody for fun, but I've never-

23:32.400 --> 23:34.080
Straight up though, you will break your hand.

23:34.720 --> 23:34.880
Like-

23:34.880 --> 23:35.200
You think?

23:35.200 --> 23:38.320
The human skull is, unless you get them like right on the cheek,

23:38.320 --> 23:40.000
the human skull is basically like,

23:41.280 --> 23:44.160
you know, an eighth inch of skin and then all bone.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.760
You will break your hand.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.120
Why not try to make a friend?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.520
Why not just give him a hug and say,

23:49.520 --> 23:54.080
listen, we're about to fight in this imaginary scenario I concocted,

23:54.080 --> 23:58.320
but like, what if we get our next question is from a guy who says,

23:58.320 --> 24:01.040
hey, I got into an argument with this guy and I almost beat him up,

24:01.040 --> 24:03.120
but then I didn't, and I feel like the bigger man.

24:03.120 --> 24:06.080
I hope he wasn't thinking about kicking me in the balls.

24:06.080 --> 24:06.640
Yeah.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.400
I'm getting married in June to his sister.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.360
He's my best man.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.120
I love him very much.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.400
I love him very much.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.360
Don't tell his sister.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.320
We are in love over a parking space.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.960
We fell in love because we hated each other so much over the parking space.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.240
I say if you're committed to fighting the guy-

24:25.440 --> 24:26.320
Samurai sword.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.200
Samurai sword.

24:27.200 --> 24:27.920
Act crazy.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.000
Hit him with the flat edge of a samurai sword.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.640
Don't cut him.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.320
We would never endorse that.

24:34.320 --> 24:37.120
Oh, start by just hitting him with the scabbard,

24:37.120 --> 24:40.000
just like whack him once in the face, just to taunt him and be like,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.200
that could have been the blade.

24:41.200 --> 24:41.840
Walk away.

24:41.840 --> 24:42.480
Walk away.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.440
I have a sword on my hip, I guess, at all times.

24:45.440 --> 24:49.040
I'm the kind of guy that rolls around with a sword tied to his waist.

24:49.040 --> 24:49.840
Walk away, bro.

24:50.880 --> 24:51.920
You know, you never hear-

24:51.920 --> 24:53.440
When you hear somebody in the ER,

24:54.240 --> 24:56.960
if you hear them in the ER and they get stabbed with a sword,

24:56.960 --> 24:58.560
it's always a samurai sword.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.040
You never hear like, he got stabbed with a midi.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.760
No, it was pretty much a guy walking around with a katana,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.480
and he just had it.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.960
And if you see a guy like that, just walk away,

25:08.960 --> 25:10.240
because he probably will-

25:10.240 --> 25:12.320
Yeah, I would say they're towing on.

25:13.040 --> 25:16.240
The katana is the official sword of crazy people.

25:16.240 --> 25:16.960
Right, yeah.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.320
I've never gotten in a fight before,

25:20.320 --> 25:23.440
and I don't know if you guys have this fear that

25:24.400 --> 25:26.720
the first time I get in a fight, I'll kill the man.

25:27.360 --> 25:27.600
Sure.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.280
Oh yeah, we've talked about this.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.000
My giant ham fist will kill a dude.

25:32.000 --> 25:32.960
I don't want to kill him.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.040
Everybody who hasn't been in a fight assumes that

25:35.040 --> 25:37.680
were they in a fight, or every man, I guess,

25:38.480 --> 25:39.200
I would limit this.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.560
I don't know if ladies think this way.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.360
I hope not.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.560
It's kind of terrifying.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.480
Every guy who hasn't been in a fight thinks that

25:44.480 --> 25:47.680
were they in a fight, they would be a lethal fight.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.160
They would be-

25:48.160 --> 25:49.680
Okay, I'm not even tapping into something deep.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.000
Suddenly, the spirit would overtake them.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.560
Something in them would flip.

25:54.560 --> 26:01.360
I don't think that I'll launch a fury of punches at a person

26:01.360 --> 26:03.360
that had such tremendous strength that it would kill him,

26:03.360 --> 26:07.200
but what if my meager upper body strength,

26:07.200 --> 26:08.720
what if I unleash that on somebody,

26:08.720 --> 26:10.480
just my normal upper body strength,

26:10.480 --> 26:12.240
but I hit them in just the right place,

26:12.240 --> 26:13.600
and their heart explodes.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.080
Whoa.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.440
That can happen all the time.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.800
What if I punch them in the brain,

26:16.800 --> 26:18.080
and their brain stops working?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.600
Or what if you punch them in the wrong place

26:19.600 --> 26:20.880
and give them a boner?

26:20.880 --> 26:25.680
What if you punch them and it makes you fully erect?

26:25.680 --> 26:27.120
You have to live with that.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.520
There's only one thing that gets me going.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.880
I've been desensitized to everything else.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.000
I have to punch a man in the face to reach full erection.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.120
Griffin, you were moving up the ranks of the UFC very quickly.

26:37.120 --> 26:37.680
What happened?

26:40.320 --> 26:42.720
My career was cut tragically short

26:42.720 --> 26:45.120
because I couldn't punch a man without getting a boner,

26:45.120 --> 26:48.800
and they found it hard to get sponsorships after that.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.640
That kept happening.

26:50.640 --> 26:54.640
Rockstar Energy Drink pulled their endorsement

26:54.640 --> 26:56.800
because they didn't like my fight boner.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.720
Yeah, but Rockstar Iggy Pop left in there and wrote me a check.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.000
He said he liked what I was doing.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.040
He said it was kind of nuts.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.600
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

27:05.600 --> 27:06.160
Yeah, sure.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.880
This one was sent in by Kelly.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.920
Thanks, Kelly.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.480
It's by Yahoo Answers user Clarissa, who asks,

27:13.280 --> 27:16.640
has anyone found any Jersey Shore fan fictions?

27:16.640 --> 27:22.720
I have already looked on miba.com and fanfiction.net,

27:22.720 --> 27:25.120
so is there any other sites or ideas on where to look?

27:26.240 --> 27:27.360
I mean, those are the two.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.880
Those are the main ones that I go to.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.160
Here's the good news.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.640
They're real people.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.000
You can make fan fat.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.320
You just go meet them and make it happen.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.240
It's a good thing that I had a little bit of free time

27:46.240 --> 27:49.120
before this episode because let me tell you, Clarissa,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.080
there is indeed Jersey Shore fan fiction.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.000
Fuck, get out of my way, bitch.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.720
I yelled out my window at the ghetto ass hooptie

27:58.720 --> 28:00.640
that was trying to cut me off.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.000
I pulled my head back into the car

28:02.000 --> 28:03.920
before taking a sip of my Red Bull.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.320
I don't need any distractions or traffic.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.080
I need to get to the Jersey Shore.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.880
I had just drove into Seaside Heights

28:10.880 --> 28:13.600
and I finally realized that people can't drive.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.800
Honk, move.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.920
Hey guys, my name is Rosalina Lee.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.440
I'm 23 and I'm ready to party it up in the Jersey Shore.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.160
I'm 50% Chinese, 50% Italian,

28:24.160 --> 28:27.360
and 100% Guidette chick from New York City.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.720
My name is Chi Chi for my Chinese heritage.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.440
Every guy loves me, every girl's a hater.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.360
I'm 5'3, hazel eyes, brunette, so sexy, isn't it?

28:38.640 --> 28:40.400
How long is that story, Griffin?

28:40.400 --> 28:41.680
That's like mad sexy.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.360
That is so sexy, Chi Chi.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.200
I mean, it's pretty good.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.480
It's a pretty good length.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.760
I'll just do a quick summary.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.120
Yeah, does it get dirty?

28:51.120 --> 28:51.600
Does it get-

28:51.600 --> 28:55.440
She lights up with Nicole Snooki-Palazzi at one point.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.920
They just fucking hit the town, tear it up.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.720
Who's that?

28:58.720 --> 28:59.680
It's Vinny.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.800
Vinny's in the mix now.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.080
Vinny, this is my girl, Chi Chi.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.840
They're drinking.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.680
Oh, Pauly's there.

29:07.680 --> 29:11.600
He's DJing a hot set with an Italian dinner fam.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.720
At an Italian family dinner party.

29:14.720 --> 29:19.440
Whoa, they're at an Italian family dinner party with Chi Chi that Pauly's DJing?

29:20.400 --> 29:23.120
Pauly is flipping on the ones and twos.

29:23.120 --> 29:23.920
Vinny's in the mix.

29:25.200 --> 29:25.760
What's that?

29:25.760 --> 29:26.240
Who's that girl?

29:26.240 --> 29:28.960
I've never seen the show, but I have to assume you're talking about Pauly Shore.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.320
Yes, Pauly Shore is there.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.200
It's a shame the situation couldn't make it out for this, did it?

29:35.200 --> 29:37.040
Yeah, situation doesn't make an appearance, I'm sorry.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.480
Yeah, okay, good, thank you.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.360
What's the art?

29:41.360 --> 29:42.160
What's the plot?

29:43.520 --> 29:44.400
They go to this party.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
They start finding codes in all of Da Vinci's paintings.

29:49.200 --> 29:53.120
We gotta steal the Declaration of Independence, and then we gotta work out on it.

29:53.120 --> 29:53.620
What?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.440
That doesn't even make sense.

29:56.640 --> 30:01.280
There's some really sweet flexes for your trikes and your dykes on the back of it.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.240
You gotta check them out.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.640
Really flex it out.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.600
Check my trikes.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.280
Check my trikes and my dykes out.

30:07.280 --> 30:12.960
I learned from the back of the Declaration of Independence that you gotta get caught.

30:14.960 --> 30:15.840
Gotta get diamond.

30:17.840 --> 30:21.520
Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln was the original of the situation?

30:22.640 --> 30:23.120
Was he?

30:26.160 --> 30:26.800
That's the truth.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.280
That's how he'd summon the strength to end slavery.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.080
It's because, do you know what his Jersey Shore name was?

30:32.080 --> 30:32.560
Tell me.

30:34.480 --> 30:35.440
The Emancipator.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
The Emancipation.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.120
The Great Emancipator.

30:39.120 --> 30:39.760
What up?

30:39.760 --> 30:40.480
Who's in the club?

30:41.120 --> 30:42.720
It's the Great Emancipator.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.800
Did you guys know that people, once you enter Jersey Shore, you get a new moniker?

30:46.800 --> 30:47.440
Really?

30:47.440 --> 30:49.200
Your name legally changes.

30:49.200 --> 30:52.640
Well, you have to apply for it, and it usually takes like six to eight weeks before you get

30:52.640 --> 30:52.880
it back.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.320
There's a lot of bureaucracy involved.

30:54.320 --> 30:59.120
You gotta go to shitty Ellis Island and change your name to something terrible.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.160
What would your guys' Jersey Shore names be, do you think?

31:03.280 --> 31:03.780
Me?

31:03.780 --> 31:04.660
Mm-hmm.

31:04.660 --> 31:05.460
Well, both of you.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.380
The two people I'm talking to on this podcast.

31:07.380 --> 31:13.220
I would get Perm, and people would call me the Ex-Perminator, but I would be, like,

31:13.220 --> 31:16.100
uncomfortable about it because the word sperm is right in there.

31:17.300 --> 31:25.140
It leaves the door open for some really just baseline low-hanging fruit ridicule that I

31:25.140 --> 31:26.900
think I would probably regret the name pretty quickly.

31:28.020 --> 31:28.500
Travis?

31:28.500 --> 31:36.420
Travis, I would probably get a really strong fake tan and want to be called Orange Julius.

31:37.860 --> 31:38.820
What about Philippe?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.380
How many Philippes are running up in there?

31:41.380 --> 31:41.940
See, that's the thing.

31:41.940 --> 31:45.380
That's what I don't understand about Jersey Shore names is that they can flip from

31:45.380 --> 31:53.300
the situation or Mr. Hardbody, like something completely out of this world crazy.

31:53.300 --> 31:59.060
Is there not one goddamn sane person in New Jersey that goes, listen, you can't name

31:59.060 --> 32:00.420
yourself the something.

32:00.980 --> 32:04.100
Like, that is not something you can do.

32:04.100 --> 32:07.140
You can't call yourself the situation.

32:07.140 --> 32:10.980
Unless you're in the XFL, you can't just name yourself anything.

32:10.980 --> 32:11.220
Right.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.860
Unless you are a group of people.

32:13.860 --> 32:18.260
If you are a group of people living inside one body, if you are Legion, then you become

32:18.260 --> 32:19.220
the situation.

32:20.260 --> 32:20.820
Look at that.

32:20.820 --> 32:23.380
I have a situation over here.

32:23.380 --> 32:27.220
My body is possessed by a squadron of demons.

32:27.220 --> 32:31.300
But like changing your name, isn't changing your name sort of like saying you're going

32:31.300 --> 32:32.980
to become a fan of this team?

32:32.980 --> 32:37.860
Like, you've got to just do it and commit to it and then let people die.

32:37.860 --> 32:40.660
You say, I'm now the situation.

32:40.660 --> 32:45.940
Like, what I'm saying is if I walk into the club and say, hi, my name is Dr.

32:45.940 --> 32:50.740
Frankenstein and let's crank it up, then the only people who are going to take me seriously

32:50.740 --> 32:54.100
are people who are meeting me for the first time that evening and maybe not even them.

32:54.980 --> 32:56.100
Definitely not even them.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.140
Especially not them.

32:57.780 --> 33:01.140
See, I think we've got to go the other route, which is if you move to Jersey Shore, you

33:01.140 --> 33:04.180
can also change your name to something completely reasonable.

33:04.180 --> 33:07.460
To something just like another name.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.180
Like a different name that another person might have.

33:10.180 --> 33:15.700
Like, oh, in Chicago, I'm Griffin, but once I get to Jersey Shore, I'm Antoine.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.260
Right.

33:16.260 --> 33:19.540
I would like my Jersey Shore name to be a situation.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.580
You don't want it to be definitive.

33:22.580 --> 33:27.940
No, I am one of any number of situations.

33:27.940 --> 33:32.980
Hey, guys, when I get done selling myself at the Jersey Shore, you know where I like

33:32.980 --> 33:34.180
to take a trip to?

33:34.180 --> 33:34.980
Where to?

33:34.980 --> 33:41.540
The money zone.

33:41.540 --> 33:53.940
Man, you just took it right there.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.140
Yeah, I was leaving.

33:55.140 --> 33:58.020
I thought, don't you put like a liner there or something?

33:58.020 --> 33:59.060
Some sort of music there.

33:59.060 --> 33:59.940
I left the gap.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.180
Who's taking us, sweet Griffin?

34:02.180 --> 34:04.980
Uh, we have two people.

34:06.900 --> 34:10.900
Two different distinct people and organizations taking us to the money zone.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.060
The first one is Dawson's puberty cream.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.460
Dawson's puberty cream.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.340
Rub it on your parts.

34:17.060 --> 34:18.020
Rub it on your throat.

34:18.020 --> 34:19.540
It's not gonna crack anymore.

34:19.540 --> 34:22.020
Dawson's for when it absolutely has to be hairy.

34:22.660 --> 34:25.300
Is that echinacea?

34:25.300 --> 34:27.300
Oh, that's delightful scent.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.140
Bob Ball.

34:29.780 --> 34:30.420
What?

34:30.420 --> 34:32.100
Bob Ball.

34:32.100 --> 34:32.740
What about him?

34:32.740 --> 34:33.300
He's a professional.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.620
I mean, he's your friend and mine, but.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.780
He's a professional voiceover artist.

34:37.780 --> 34:39.220
And people say, what is that?

34:39.220 --> 34:40.260
Like, I don't know what that is.

34:40.260 --> 34:41.140
You don't know what that is.

34:41.140 --> 34:42.500
I'm an idiot baby child.

34:43.060 --> 34:43.940
You're a fool.

34:43.940 --> 34:44.740
Let me tell you.

34:44.740 --> 34:46.740
It's when you talk, but you don't see the person.

34:46.740 --> 34:47.700
That's a voice actor.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.380
We haven't talked about it in a while, but like, if you listen to the show and at the

34:51.380 --> 34:56.980
beginning of the show, you're like, who is reading that smooth, velvety warning at the

34:56.980 --> 34:57.860
beginning of the show?

34:57.860 --> 35:01.380
I always thought it was, I always thought it was the dragon from Dragonheart.

35:02.100 --> 35:02.500
Did you?

35:03.140 --> 35:03.860
Yeah.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.340
Like not the, not Sean Connery, but the actual dragon.

35:06.340 --> 35:08.980
The actual dragon whose voice they had to dub over.

35:08.980 --> 35:09.300
Yeah.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.740
Like Natalie Wood in West Side Story.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.100
This dragon's super loud.

35:14.900 --> 35:15.940
You keep it down, dragon.

35:15.940 --> 35:18.420
We're just gonna replace you with Sean Connery.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.140
That's it.

35:19.140 --> 35:20.740
You would get a Bob Ball.

35:20.740 --> 35:21.380
He does that.

35:21.380 --> 35:26.660
He does voiceover dragon work, commercials, podcast intros, voicemails, whatever.

35:26.660 --> 35:28.340
He'll do anything for you.

35:28.340 --> 35:34.900
And he has a range, he says, from condamining to condescending, explanatory to exclamatory,

35:34.900 --> 35:38.180
which that should probably be on his business cards.

35:38.180 --> 35:39.140
On his everything.

35:39.140 --> 35:41.620
He should tattoo that on himself, on his body.

35:41.620 --> 35:42.340
Yeah, he can write.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.220
He does sound effects.

35:43.220 --> 35:47.700
He edited a video for us over at Joystick that was dynamite.

35:48.260 --> 35:48.980
It was a lot of fun.

35:49.540 --> 35:50.820
And his rates are reasonable.

35:50.820 --> 35:56.420
And if you want to get a hold of him, it's Bob at BobBallVO.com.

35:57.300 --> 36:00.020
And you can check out the website, BobBallVO.com.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.140
And he's revamping that website.

36:01.140 --> 36:02.180
So make sure you check it out.

36:02.180 --> 36:03.380
Lots of interactivity.

36:03.380 --> 36:04.900
Some games for the kids.

36:04.900 --> 36:05.860
Go to the kids corner.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.300
We'll send your kids to sleep.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.500
Something for everybody.

36:08.500 --> 36:15.460
And as a special, special edition, this week on Thursday, April 14th, his wonderful wife,

36:15.460 --> 36:20.740
Michelle, it's her birthday and she will be turning 21 again.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.100
So happy birthday, Michelle.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.180
Now, also, this is a bi-lane.

36:26.180 --> 36:30.660
There's a bi-lane we're taking also to the money zone.

36:30.660 --> 36:32.260
Also, metagame theory.

36:32.260 --> 36:35.940
Or as Travis here has written, meet game theory.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.700
Theory.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.860
You know, theory, theory.

36:39.860 --> 36:45.140
Justin, do you know how hard it is to write an email when you're drunk at eight in the morning?

36:46.020 --> 36:48.740
I do want you guys to know that traditionally,

36:49.460 --> 36:53.700
how I build the question list is just mostly all just copy and pasting.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.780
And I actually had to type that one in.

36:55.780 --> 37:00.980
It was the one thing in this entire list I hand typed and I blew it.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.140
metagame theory.com.

37:03.140 --> 37:08.580
That's a podcast that explores the unique ability all games have to stimulate the mind.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.180
Not just your thumbs.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.540
See, I usually just feel it in my thumbs.

37:13.540 --> 37:15.220
Is it because I don't listen to this podcast?

37:15.220 --> 37:16.660
I don't know how to open myself.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.900
You need to open your heart to the metagame theory.

37:20.100 --> 37:25.300
I want to know how the games I play affect me psychologically, psychosomatically.

37:25.300 --> 37:29.060
Okay, well, listen, if you want that, metagame theory is that for you.

37:29.060 --> 37:30.500
But it's also a gaming channel.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.260
It brings you strategy talk.

37:32.820 --> 37:33.700
They got rants.

37:33.700 --> 37:42.420
They got special guests, old friends, and theories that connect them all in the Medicaid.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.300
This is a show.

37:43.300 --> 37:46.980
This is the matrix of podcasts is the best way to describe it.

37:46.980 --> 37:51.380
If you would be the one, you can find the show at metagame theory.com.

37:52.660 --> 37:54.660
How much is it gonna cost me, Ditto?

37:54.660 --> 37:56.660
$108 an episode.

37:56.660 --> 37:57.860
Whoa, whoa.

37:57.860 --> 38:01.540
Yeah, listen, that's pricey, but you got to think of everything you're getting for that.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.300
You're getting competitive rants.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.140
You're getting old friends.

38:05.140 --> 38:06.660
Maybe get some new friends.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.140
You're gonna learn things about games that you didn't know about.

38:09.780 --> 38:15.300
Tetris is a brainwashing machine invented by the Russians.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.180
Whoa, really?

38:16.180 --> 38:17.540
Yeah, yeah.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.380
They ended the Cold War with Tetris.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.620
And you learned this at metagame theory.com?

38:21.620 --> 38:22.340
Mm-hmm.

38:22.340 --> 38:24.020
Well, not that, because it's a lie.

38:24.020 --> 38:26.020
It's total phony baloney bullshit I just made up.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.460
It just from whole class.

38:27.460 --> 38:31.300
Actually, the show is entirely free, incredibly free.

38:31.300 --> 38:35.140
Oh, yeah, yeah, the $108 thing, that was totally fallacious.

38:35.140 --> 38:38.900
You're just like a lot of flim-flam from you today, I feel like.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.820
Yeah, I'm a flamster.

38:40.820 --> 38:43.300
This is true, though.

38:43.300 --> 38:47.380
The first three people who go subscribe to the RSS feed on the site and then send an

38:47.380 --> 38:50.660
email mentioning this ad are gonna get a free t-shirt.

38:50.660 --> 38:51.300
Go.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.340
Whoa.

38:52.340 --> 38:52.740
Go rush.

38:52.740 --> 38:53.620
Gird your stupid loins.

38:54.420 --> 38:55.940
Go gird your stupid.

38:55.940 --> 38:58.660
Why would you gird your loins with a t-shirt, Griffin?

38:58.660 --> 39:00.020
I mean, it's diaper.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.340
If it was free, I figured fuck it, right?

39:02.340 --> 39:04.900
I made a diaper out of this metagame theory.com t-shirt.

39:05.940 --> 39:10.340
But listen to that show, and maybe, oh, what if these two forces could get together?

39:10.340 --> 39:16.260
What if Bob Ball could do voiceover for Metagame Theory, or as Travis has written here, meet

39:16.260 --> 39:17.380
game theory?

39:17.380 --> 39:18.740
That's the old tongue.

39:21.380 --> 39:23.380
In the old tongue.

39:23.380 --> 39:28.340
You've actually written Rob Tall here, too, which is weird, because that's not his name.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.460
I'm Rob Tall.

39:29.460 --> 39:30.900
I'm a voiceover fardist.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.700
A voiceover fardist?

39:37.700 --> 39:38.820
Yes, that's what I said.

39:40.100 --> 39:45.540
And if you go to, maybe if the two of them go together, you'll hear a song that the two

39:45.540 --> 39:53.220
of them will make, a jingle, if you will, that might sound a little something like this.

39:53.220 --> 40:08.100
Gotta pop those nooks first.

40:08.100 --> 40:12.100
His name is Bob, that's short for Robert.

40:13.620 --> 40:18.020
His brother's name is Rob, that's also short for Robert.

40:18.020 --> 40:27.620
One acts with voices, the other facts with voices, and they love each other very, very,

40:27.620 --> 40:29.140
very, very, very much.

40:31.380 --> 40:39.300
He's got the voice of a dragon, he's got the eyes of a marmot, he's got the soul of a man,

40:39.300 --> 40:49.700
and the body of a man, but he's playing mind games, he's playing mind games, like the kind

40:49.700 --> 40:53.460
of mind games you find at Metagame Theory.

40:54.100 --> 41:01.060
I said the kind of the mind that you find at Metagame Theory.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.780
Did I mention voice of the dragon yet?

41:04.420 --> 41:05.380
Yeah, I think you got that.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.100
Can you say something about the free t-shirt?

41:08.100 --> 41:09.220
Can you work that in?

41:09.220 --> 41:09.700
Yeah, okay.

41:12.180 --> 41:15.380
Robert, Robert, what you wearing?

41:15.380 --> 41:22.660
Robert, what you got on there, underneath that suit and tie, right against your chest.

41:23.540 --> 41:28.820
Don't play it so close to the chest, gotta know what your t-shirt say.

41:29.380 --> 41:33.060
It says metagametheory.com, and it was free.

41:33.060 --> 41:41.940
I didn't pay anything for this t-shirt, I got it from my brother, who won a podcast contest.

41:46.660 --> 41:47.380
The end.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.660
That was wonderful.

41:49.380 --> 41:51.300
I feel like I can get like four or five more verses out of that.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.060
No, I don't think we need that many.

41:53.060 --> 41:56.500
I don't think would be, I think, hey, this is kind of-

41:56.500 --> 42:02.260
Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob,

42:02.260 --> 42:10.420
Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob, Robin Bob,

42:10.420 --> 42:14.580
they both have dragon voices, Robin Bob, Robin Bob.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.020
Hey, this is an ironically timed question.

42:20.020 --> 42:25.700
I am bored, unless I'm actually laughing at any moment, I am bored.

42:25.700 --> 42:30.580
I think this is causing problems in all areas of my life, but especially trying to keep a man.

42:30.580 --> 42:32.020
They're all just too boring.

42:32.020 --> 42:36.100
How can I retrain my brain, says Allison, 29 and three fourths.

42:36.660 --> 42:39.300
Sounds like you're leading the most boring life.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.020
Yeah, what about some excitement?

42:42.020 --> 42:46.660
Maybe put some Tabasco in your meals, both metaphysically and sort of literally.

42:47.460 --> 42:48.980
Like put Tabasco on your soul?

42:49.700 --> 42:55.620
Yeah, a little soul in your bowl, a little spice, spice in your life.

42:56.260 --> 42:57.460
The spice is life.

42:57.460 --> 42:58.020
Oh my God.

42:58.020 --> 43:00.420
Why don't you throw some Tabasco on your man?

43:00.420 --> 43:02.820
Ooh, you won't see that coming.

43:02.820 --> 43:03.380
In his eyes.

43:05.860 --> 43:07.860
You gotta keep it zesty, Allison.

43:09.140 --> 43:11.540
Do one thing every day that scares you.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.020
How's that sound?

43:15.300 --> 43:16.580
That sounds pretty inspirational, doesn't it?

43:16.580 --> 43:18.740
Stab myself in the stomach a little bit.

43:19.940 --> 43:21.460
I'm starting to scare myself.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.100
Just the tip.

43:23.220 --> 43:27.220
Maybe men are, I mean, people are, can be kind of boring.

43:27.220 --> 43:29.140
I think you need to think about this.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.660
I'm gonna turn this around on you yet again.

43:31.620 --> 43:32.660
Maybe chicks.

43:32.660 --> 43:33.540
Hold on.

43:33.540 --> 43:34.020
No way.

43:34.580 --> 43:35.060
No way.

43:35.060 --> 43:35.780
Stay with me.

43:36.500 --> 43:39.460
I don't know why you're trying to usher in the apocalypse even faster.

43:40.580 --> 43:41.620
We'll get there eventually.

43:43.700 --> 43:44.580
Classic callback.

43:47.460 --> 43:51.140
You gotta peel back the layers because everybody has something magical inside them.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.220
Everybody has a little seed of magic.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.900
You just gotta get to it.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.260
Even the Bay Harbor butcher.

43:56.260 --> 43:59.380
The Bay Harbor butcher, he has obviously a lot of love in his soul.

43:59.380 --> 44:02.660
He just doesn't know how to let it out right without cutting women.

44:04.260 --> 44:06.900
I don't want to be too counterproductive here, but you may want to just like,

44:07.620 --> 44:11.140
I don't want to say lower your standards, but life isn't going to be

44:11.140 --> 44:13.940
a constant rollercoaster of excitement.

44:14.660 --> 44:15.940
Unless you work at King's Island.

44:16.660 --> 44:16.900
Yeah.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.100
There it is.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.140
Get a job at King's Island.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.340
Get a job at King's Island.

44:20.340 --> 44:21.860
Ride the son of the beast every day.

44:22.420 --> 44:23.300
Oh, too bad they closed that.

44:23.300 --> 44:26.340
Well, that'll be especially scary because that is closed.

44:26.340 --> 44:27.620
Yeah, it doesn't exist.

44:27.620 --> 44:28.660
But that's good, man.

44:28.660 --> 44:29.700
Fuck that rollercoaster.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.860
That rollercoaster took my eye, I think.

44:31.860 --> 44:32.180
Oh yeah?

44:32.180 --> 44:33.140
You know, my eye's bad.

44:33.140 --> 44:36.020
I think that rollercoaster scared my eye into not working.

44:36.820 --> 44:37.220
Wow.

44:37.220 --> 44:39.380
Something every day that scares your eye.

44:39.380 --> 44:40.500
Think about this, Allison.

44:41.140 --> 44:46.820
By leading a boring life, you've avoided having your eyes scared to the point of in operation.

44:47.860 --> 44:49.380
As it happens all the time.

44:49.380 --> 44:51.060
I read about it in the science journal.

44:51.060 --> 44:53.140
How about a Yahoo?

44:53.140 --> 44:54.020
Because I've got a lot of them.

44:54.020 --> 44:54.900
Give me, give me, give me.

44:55.700 --> 44:56.740
Oh, this will be good.

44:56.740 --> 45:00.020
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker, who's just the best guy.

45:01.300 --> 45:04.260
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ice Cream Eater, who asks,

45:07.700 --> 45:11.540
should I build a disco playhouse for kids in my backyard?

45:13.140 --> 45:13.540
Yes.

45:14.740 --> 45:15.780
Let me explain.

45:15.780 --> 45:21.380
I had this idea in the back of my head for a while, and I liked a little advice.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.260
And that's what we do here.

45:22.820 --> 45:26.900
I myself was a 70s kid, and disco fever never died in my heart.

45:27.780 --> 45:31.460
What if I built a mini Studio 54 in my backyard?

45:33.380 --> 45:39.460
I could get a disco ball, a stereo for my old record player, and a Pixy Stix vending machine.

45:39.460 --> 45:48.100
I'd love to dress my kids up like 70s celebrities like John Travolta, Barbara Streisand, Mick Jagger,

45:48.100 --> 45:50.260
and such, and make them dance and have fun.

45:50.900 --> 45:52.420
Should I go through with the idea?

45:52.420 --> 45:53.940
Hey, you fucking kids.

45:53.940 --> 45:55.860
Hey, you fucking kids, you don't look like you're having fun.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.180
We're gonna make you have fun, Babs.

45:58.740 --> 46:00.500
I'm gonna make you have fun.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.340
Little Babs, dance with little John.

46:02.340 --> 46:02.740
Have fun.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.900
Do your best, Jagger, because you're Mick Jagger.

46:04.900 --> 46:05.460
Do it.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.980
Snort this Pixy Stix.

46:06.980 --> 46:07.860
Snort it.

46:07.860 --> 46:09.700
That's what he means, right, by Pixy Stix?

46:09.700 --> 46:10.660
Oh, Christ, yes.

46:10.660 --> 46:14.340
What colors should the inside of the disco playhouse be painted?

46:14.340 --> 46:18.740
Should the disco playhouse have windows or no windows so it's dark inside?

46:18.740 --> 46:19.220
Yeah, I think-

46:19.220 --> 46:22.500
What is the color of massive amounts of psychological suffering?

46:23.060 --> 46:24.020
That's really gonna-

46:24.020 --> 46:24.420
Puse?

46:25.220 --> 46:27.780
What color would you paint the inside of the disco playhouse door?

46:27.780 --> 46:32.020
If the disco light's disco ball is turned on and me and the kids are dancing,

46:32.020 --> 46:35.700
would it be better to have curtains at the entrance of the disco playhouse to block out

46:35.700 --> 46:38.260
any outside light or no curtains and close the door?

46:38.820 --> 46:39.380
I think-

46:40.580 --> 46:41.780
Holy fucking shit!

46:41.780 --> 46:43.140
Jesus Christ!

46:43.140 --> 46:45.460
Which is the one that keeps Jesus out?

46:45.460 --> 46:46.900
Is that curtains or is that a door?

46:46.900 --> 46:50.500
Cause if he could see, he's gonna kill you instantly and take you to hell.

46:50.500 --> 46:51.140
Himself.

46:51.140 --> 46:52.500
And he doesn't like to go down there.

46:53.780 --> 46:54.280
Wow!

46:55.380 --> 46:55.880
So-

46:56.500 --> 46:57.060
Dog.

46:57.060 --> 46:57.380
You-

46:57.380 --> 46:57.940
Dog!

46:57.940 --> 46:58.180
No.

46:58.740 --> 46:59.620
No windows.

47:00.260 --> 47:00.900
No.

47:00.900 --> 47:02.420
You owe it to your-

47:02.420 --> 47:03.540
Your brood.

47:03.540 --> 47:04.900
Your ruined brood.

47:04.900 --> 47:05.860
No windows.

47:05.860 --> 47:10.660
To make sure that their fucking friends, their cohorts in elementary school,

47:10.660 --> 47:15.860
aren't gonna see them dressed up in polyester jumpsuits and snorting pixie sticks with their dad!

47:15.860 --> 47:16.500
It's too late!

47:16.500 --> 47:17.220
Their dad-

47:17.220 --> 47:18.020
Their dad inside!

47:18.020 --> 47:19.060
You killed him already!

47:19.860 --> 47:24.180
Their dad inside and outside if you let them snort pixie sticks in a tiny Studio 54 you

47:24.180 --> 47:25.620
built in your backyard!

47:25.620 --> 47:28.100
Hey, I know I only get you kids on the weekends, but listen.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.380
Listen, look what I've been working on all week.

47:31.380 --> 47:34.740
Uh, I've been working on a discotheque for you and your little-

47:34.740 --> 47:36.100
Do your friends want to come?

47:36.100 --> 47:38.660
You want to have your little friends come?

47:38.660 --> 47:39.940
Dad, we're 26.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.620
We're 26 years old, dad.

47:41.620 --> 47:45.380
You know, you know, I heard your friends talking about how much you love the Gap Band and I

47:45.380 --> 47:49.540
was just, oh, that's a conversation that never happened, nor will it ever.

47:49.540 --> 47:51.060
God, I miss the 70s.

47:51.060 --> 47:52.420
Yeah, I miss the 70s too.

47:52.420 --> 47:56.180
Hey, do you guys want to make a wild cherry reunion group?

47:56.180 --> 47:57.620
Like, we'll get a wild-

47:57.620 --> 47:59.620
Little Wild Cherries is what we'll call it.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.620
Motherfucker.

48:01.620 --> 48:07.620
How- Okay, no windows, no doors, no walls.

48:07.620 --> 48:08.660
Don't do it.

48:08.660 --> 48:10.660
No problem.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.620
No problem.

48:11.620 --> 48:16.500
You never had- I know- Listen, I've had some fucking stupid ideas too, okay?

48:16.500 --> 48:17.620
I'm there with you.

48:17.620 --> 48:21.860
Like, I've had some ill-advised notions that my wife has had to dispel me of.

48:21.860 --> 48:24.100
Uh, I tried to order my own dinner once.

48:24.100 --> 48:25.940
That did not go well, for example.

48:25.940 --> 48:29.700
The, this, or is it great?

48:29.700 --> 48:36.180
Like, I want it to be going on in the world that I live in, I just don't like the idea

48:36.180 --> 48:37.780
of it happening to real people.

48:37.780 --> 48:41.140
Yeah, I don't like the idea of a dad, like, consulting with his children, like, should

48:41.140 --> 48:42.500
there be a fuck room?

48:42.500 --> 48:44.500
Like, dad?

48:44.500 --> 48:44.980
Daddy?

48:44.980 --> 48:51.060
Should we just have a, like a champagne, a champagne re- like a champagne tent, maybe?

48:51.060 --> 48:53.780
This is the slick, this is the stupid slide.

48:53.780 --> 48:56.100
It's coated in vodka.

48:56.100 --> 48:59.460
This is crazy, tonight.

48:59.460 --> 49:06.340
I think that you're never too young to indulge in all of your mind and heart's bacchanalian

49:06.340 --> 49:08.180
desires.

49:08.180 --> 49:12.820
Unless the only party guests have the same last name as you.

49:12.820 --> 49:17.300
In which case, you're always too young- It's just gonna be me and the kids, partying

49:17.300 --> 49:19.700
like it's 1973.

49:19.700 --> 49:20.820
The kids- No.

49:20.820 --> 49:23.380
The kids punked out at, like, 1030.

49:23.380 --> 49:25.780
They went inside and watched Babar.

49:25.780 --> 49:29.780
But I stayed there just twirling, just wildly twirling to the sound of Donna's Lover.

49:29.780 --> 49:34.180
Just twirling, hoping that if I spin fast enough, I'll reverse the rotation of the earth

49:34.180 --> 49:40.260
and travel back in time to grown-up Studio 54, to adult Studio 54.

49:40.260 --> 49:43.700
You know, the one good thing about this is you're really gonna prepare your kids, because

49:43.700 --> 49:49.540
for the rest of their life, they can always, like, no matter how sad or weird things get

49:49.540 --> 49:52.980
for them, they can always say it's neither the saddest nor weirdest thing.

49:52.980 --> 49:55.380
They've never been a party to.

49:55.380 --> 49:59.380
And when your kid becomes the Bay Harbor Butcher and they're constantly trying to peel people's

49:59.380 --> 50:03.460
faces off, they have a pretty justifiable reason for why they are that way.

50:03.460 --> 50:07.140
Hey, I just want to say, I don't want to creep you out, but I think you're beautiful.

50:07.140 --> 50:11.060
Can I teach you how to roller skate?

50:11.060 --> 50:14.020
Will you come to Lil' 54 with me?

50:14.020 --> 50:15.700
We're going to Lil' 54.

50:15.700 --> 50:20.740
I hear Lil' Elton John is there, playing Lil' Crocodile Rock.

50:20.740 --> 50:21.740
The kids love it.

50:21.740 --> 50:23.300
It turns out to be really fucking fresh, though.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.220
What if it's dope and every kid wants to get in?

50:25.220 --> 50:28.020
What if it's dope and everyone wants to be your kid's friends because of it?

50:28.020 --> 50:33.860
They have to stand behind a tiny velvet rope and have sex with the tiny doorman to get

50:33.860 --> 50:34.860
in.

50:34.860 --> 50:35.860
Stop it.

50:35.860 --> 50:36.860
That's not good.

50:36.860 --> 50:37.860
You're weirding me out.

50:37.860 --> 50:38.860
That is what will happen.

50:38.860 --> 50:43.580
I hadn't seen the movie in there, a movie called, like, Just 54, and it's just like

50:43.580 --> 50:46.100
Mike Myers and Ryan Phillippe.

50:46.100 --> 50:49.900
Mike Myers is in it, and they're just, like, fucking in big pits of bubbles all the time

50:49.900 --> 50:51.700
when the bubbles are made of LSD.

50:51.700 --> 50:52.700
Yeah.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.780
And then, like, three flamingos are there.

50:54.780 --> 50:58.620
What if the dad is the only one that gets coked out, and he just, like, rolls around

50:58.620 --> 51:01.260
the dance floor welcoming kids to his party?

51:01.260 --> 51:03.260
Welcome to my party!

51:03.260 --> 51:04.660
Welcome.

51:04.660 --> 51:08.580
Welcome to Lil' 54.

51:08.580 --> 51:11.100
Michael's over there in the corner if you want to go play with him.

51:11.100 --> 51:12.980
What do you mean I can't get in, Lil' Bouncer?

51:12.980 --> 51:14.420
I made this place.

51:14.420 --> 51:16.060
I built this out of my own two hands.

51:16.060 --> 51:19.620
I am Lil' Studio 54.

51:19.620 --> 51:20.620
That's so little.

51:20.620 --> 51:22.540
You can't cut me out, David.

51:22.540 --> 51:26.020
We built this together one weekend.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.020
If you remember.

51:27.020 --> 51:34.540
If this happens, can everybody, can we crowdsource this and just say, everybody, go outside,

51:34.540 --> 51:38.980
look in your backyard, look in your neighbor's backyards, and if you see this, can you just

51:38.980 --> 51:39.980
call me?

51:39.980 --> 51:40.980
I'll give you my number.

51:40.980 --> 51:42.580
I need to know.

51:42.580 --> 51:46.100
It's been a really rough month, and I could really use this in my life right now.

51:46.100 --> 51:51.500
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first, a few housekeeping things.

51:51.500 --> 51:55.980
If you haven't gotten tickets to our live show yet in Chicago, that's going to be next

51:55.980 --> 52:03.420
Sunday, you know, six days from today, I guess, 10 o'clock, us, Dan Telford, Jordan Jesse

52:03.420 --> 52:04.420
Goh.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.420
It's going to be huge.

52:05.420 --> 52:06.420
We've sold about half the tickets.

52:06.420 --> 52:11.140
They're only 12 bucks, so if you want to go bring a crew, it's going to be a lot of

52:11.140 --> 52:12.140
fun.

52:12.140 --> 52:13.140
When can they get tickets?

52:13.140 --> 52:16.340
Is that a good time, right, or you can go...

52:16.340 --> 52:17.340
We will...

52:17.340 --> 52:18.340
There's a couple links on the MaximumFun.org.

52:18.340 --> 52:19.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:19.340 --> 52:22.460
We'll tweet blast it, too, when this episode goes up.

52:22.460 --> 52:24.620
You can check out, but make sure you get tickets to that.

52:24.620 --> 52:28.620
Like we said, they're only 12 bucks, and it'll be a lot of fun.

52:28.620 --> 52:30.700
MBMAM.com is our website.

52:30.700 --> 52:34.820
That's where you can go to listen to other episodes of the show.

52:34.820 --> 52:38.860
The ways you can ask us questions are there.

52:38.860 --> 52:39.860
MBMAM.com.

52:39.860 --> 52:47.020
It's at MaximumFun.org, MBMAM, MBMAM at MaximumFun.org.

52:47.020 --> 52:48.020
One year, guys.

52:48.020 --> 52:49.020
One year.

52:49.020 --> 52:52.140
One year we've been doing this, and you can't get the URL correct.

52:52.140 --> 52:53.140
I'm sorry.

52:53.140 --> 52:55.980
It's that hyperlink.

52:55.980 --> 52:58.340
Any Twitter people we want to say hi to?

52:58.340 --> 53:00.340
I mean, who's been talking up the show?

53:00.340 --> 53:04.620
Dan Rogers took his MBMAM shirt to go see the Pixies.

53:04.620 --> 53:08.820
I'm sure Frank Black saw it and thought, hey, looking good.

53:08.820 --> 53:12.420
There goes my favorite podcast.

53:12.420 --> 53:16.740
I Am Ben Kendrick is throwing a pack your bags and move away going away party.

53:16.740 --> 53:17.740
A theme there.

53:17.740 --> 53:18.740
We like that.

53:18.740 --> 53:19.740
Where's it going away to?

53:19.740 --> 53:20.740
I don't know.

53:20.740 --> 53:21.740
Cool.

53:21.740 --> 53:22.740
They're leaving New York.

53:22.740 --> 53:27.660
Momohine has caught up on all the back episodes, even with her aching teeth.

53:27.660 --> 53:28.660
Aw.

53:28.660 --> 53:29.660
I know.

53:29.660 --> 53:33.540
Our show is best appreciated when you still got like a little nitrous buzz.

53:33.540 --> 53:34.540
Go ahead.

53:34.540 --> 53:35.540
From the dentist.

53:35.540 --> 53:36.540
MBMAM.com.

53:36.540 --> 53:42.500
You can also you'll see a link to the forums there, lots of good discussions and growing.

53:42.500 --> 53:44.300
We're there all the time talking with people.

53:44.300 --> 53:49.460
So make sure you stop by and say hello and make sure at the live show.

53:49.460 --> 53:54.980
If you come, you know, send us questions now and maybe we'll get at the live show and let

53:54.980 --> 53:55.980
us know.

53:55.980 --> 53:57.380
Say, hey, I'm going to be in the live show.

53:57.380 --> 53:59.020
And here's my question.

53:59.020 --> 54:02.620
And also make sure to stick around afterwards because we'll probably go get schwaisted.

54:02.620 --> 54:04.980
It's going to be my fucking birthday.

54:04.980 --> 54:06.020
Everyone's going to be there.

54:06.020 --> 54:07.020
My dad's going to be there.

54:07.020 --> 54:08.020
It's going to be dope.

54:08.020 --> 54:09.020
We're going to party.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.020
We're going to party with my dad.

54:10.020 --> 54:11.020
It's going to be sick.

54:11.020 --> 54:12.020
It's going to be sick.

54:12.020 --> 54:14.020
It'll be like a little 54 again.

54:14.020 --> 54:17.540
It's going to be a tiny baby 54 for me.

54:17.540 --> 54:19.340
It's going to be like big, tiny 54.

54:19.340 --> 54:21.440
We're going to have pixie sticks.

54:21.440 --> 54:24.020
As far as the eye can see, we're going to snort them.

54:24.020 --> 54:25.020
My dad's going to be there.

54:25.020 --> 54:26.020
It's going to be sick.

54:26.020 --> 54:29.940
Seriously though, all kidding aside, it's been a year we've been doing this.

54:29.940 --> 54:32.140
Thank you guys so, so much.

54:32.140 --> 54:36.460
I know we say thank you a lot, but I really mean it.

54:36.460 --> 54:39.820
I don't think we mentioned this on the show last week, but we broke a million downloads.

54:39.820 --> 54:40.820
Broke a million downloads.

54:40.820 --> 54:44.580
It's just because you guys have been so super cool and supportive.

54:44.580 --> 54:47.700
Thank you for spreading the word in our first year.

54:47.700 --> 54:52.100
Please keep talking to people about the show because that's how we've grown.

54:52.100 --> 54:55.140
It's why we're still doing it because you guys have been so cool and supportive and

54:55.140 --> 54:56.140
everything.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.140
And thank you.

54:57.140 --> 54:58.140
We really appreciate it.

54:58.140 --> 54:59.500
I love you.

54:59.500 --> 55:01.820
So Griffin, hit me.

55:01.820 --> 55:03.780
I'm ready.

55:03.780 --> 55:09.900
This one is a final question for episode 50, sent in by Jacob Locker.

55:09.900 --> 55:10.900
Thank you Jacob.

55:10.900 --> 55:18.420
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jay who asks, how to do extreme couponing?

55:18.420 --> 55:21.660
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:21.660 --> 55:25.140
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:25.140 --> 55:26.140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:26.140 --> 55:28.220
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

55:28.220 --> 55:29.220
Kiss your dad.

55:29.220 --> 55:44.500
Go wear them ellipses.
